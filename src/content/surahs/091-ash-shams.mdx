# Ash-Shams (The Sun)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 15
- **Theme:** This surah features one of the longest oath series in the Quran (verses 1-7), swearing by the sun, moon, day, night, heaven, earth, and the soul. It emphasizes that success comes from purifying the soul and failure from corrupting it. The surah concludes with the story of Thamud and their prophet Salih, illustrating the consequences of rejecting divine guidance.
- **Grammar Focus:** Extended oath constructions with وَ (wa), emphasis particle قَدْ (qad), past tense narrative, passive voice constructions, relative clauses, Form II verbs (intensified action)

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Longest Oath Sequence in the Quran">
Ash-Shams contains the longest unbroken oath sequence in the entire Quran: seven consecutive oaths spanning verses 1-7, each introduced by the oath particle وَ. This is extraordinary because the answer to the oath (jawab al-qasam) does not arrive until verse 9 with قَدْ أَفْلَحَ. The sheer length of the buildup creates immense rhetorical weight, and every sworn element -- sun, moon, day, night, sky, earth, soul -- converges on a single moral truth: purify the soul or face ruin. Notice also how the oaths progress from the cosmic (sun, moon) to the terrestrial (day, night) to the divine creative act (sky, earth) and finally to the human soul -- a deliberate narrowing from the universe down to the individual.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-sh-shamsi wa-duhaha"
  translation="By the sun and its brightness"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:1"
  highlight="وَالشَّمْسِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | by |
| 2 | الشَّمْسِ | ash-shamsi | ش-م-س | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the sun |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni), coordinates | and |
| 4 | ضُحَاهَا | duhaha | ض-ح-و | Noun - feminine, singular, indefinite + attached pronoun | Genitive (majrur) in idafa, هَا 3rd person pronoun in genitive | its brightness/morning light |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Oath Particle وَ and Genitive Case">
The opening وَ here is not a simple conjunction but an oath particle (huruf al-qasam). It governs the genitive case on the noun that follows it, which is why الشَّمْسِ appears with kasra. This وَ is equivalent to "I swear by..." and is one of three oath particles in Arabic (وَ, بِ, تَ). Throughout verses 1-7, each وَ introduces a new oath, placing its noun in the genitive.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse opens with the oath particle وَ governing الشَّمْسِ in the genitive. The second وَ is a conjunction (atf) coordinating ضُحَاهَا with الشَّمْسِ. ضُحَاهَا is in an idafa relationship with the attached pronoun هَا, which refers back to الشَّمْسِ. The jawab al-qasam (answer to the oath) is delayed until verse 9.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الشَّمْسِ is from root ش-م-س on the فَعْل pattern, a feminine noun (no ta marbuta but inherently feminine). ضُحَى is from root ض-ح-و on the فُعَل pattern, a noun denoting the morning brightness or forenoon.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with the sun establishes cosmic grandeur. The pairing of the sun with its own radiance (ضُحَاهَا) draws attention to the relationship between a thing and its essential quality -- the sun is inseparable from its light, just as the soul (introduced in verse 7) is inseparable from its moral nature.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-l-qamari idha talaha"
  translation="And [by] the moon when it follows it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:2"
  highlight="تَلَاهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | الْقَمَرِ | al-qamari | ق-م-ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the moon |
| 3 | إِذَا | idha | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Not declinable (mabni), introduces when-clause | when |
| 4 | تَلَاهَا | talaha | ت-ل-و | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | it followed it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Temporal Qualification of Oaths">
The oath is not by the moon in general, but by the moon specifically "when it follows" the sun. The إِذَا clause narrows the oath to a particular cosmic moment -- the appearance of the moon after sunset. This pattern of oath + temporal clause continues in verses 3 and 4, each capturing a specific astronomical phenomenon.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَالْقَمَرِ continues the oath series with القمر in the genitive. إِذَا introduces a temporal clause (zarf li-l-mustaqbal) qualifying the noun under oath. تَلَاهَا is the verb of the إِذَا clause; the hidden pronoun (هُوَ) is the subject referring to the moon, and هَا is the object pronoun referring to the sun.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْقَمَرِ is from root ق-م-ر on the فَعَل pattern. تَلَاهَا is a Form I verb from root ت-ل-و, a defective (naqis) verb whose final radical و becomes alif in the past tense. The هَا suffix is the attached object pronoun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The image of the moon "following" the sun personifies the celestial bodies, suggesting obedience and order in creation. This sets up the later contrast with Thamud, who refused to follow divine guidance. The verb تَلَا also carries the connotation of "reciting" or "following a path," adding a layer of meaning about following divine will.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-n-nahari idha jallaha"
  translation="And [by] the day when it displays it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:3"
  highlight="جَلَّاهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | النَّهَارِ | an-nahari | ن-ه-ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the day |
| 3 | إِذَا | idha | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Not declinable (mabni), introduces when-clause | when |
| 4 | جَلَّاهَا | jallaha | ج-ل-و | Verb - Form II, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | it displayed/revealed it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form II Intensive: جَلَّاهَا">
جَلَّاهَا is a Form II verb (فَعَّلَ pattern) from root ج-ل-و. While the Form I جَلَا means "to reveal," Form II جَلَّى intensifies this to "to display fully, to make brilliantly visible." The doubled middle radical (لّ) signals this intensification. This is the first of several Form II verbs in the surah (سَوَّاهَا, زَكَّاهَا, دَسَّاهَا, كَذَّبَتْ), making Form II a central morphological theme.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Same oath structure as verse 2: وَ oath particle + النَّهَارِ (genitive) + إِذَا temporal clause + جَلَّاهَا (verb + object pronoun). The subject of جَلَّاهَا is the hidden pronoun (هُوَ) referring to النَّهَار, and the object هَا refers back to الشَّمْس or the earth.

**Sarf (Morphology):** النَّهَارِ is from root ن-ه-ر on the فَعَال pattern. جَلَّاهَا is Form II from root ج-ل-و, a defective (naqis) verb. The doubled middle radical (لّ) is the hallmark of Form II, indicating intensive or causative meaning.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The contrast between day revealing (جَلَّاهَا) and night covering (يَغْشَاهَا in the next verse) creates a pair of opposites (tibaq), a key rhetorical device. The choice of Form II intensifies the action -- the day does not merely show the sun but fully and gloriously displays it.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-l-layli idha yaghshaha"
  translation="And [by] the night when it covers it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:4"
  highlight="يَغْشَاهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | اللَّيْلِ | al-layli | ل-ي-ل | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the night |
| 3 | إِذَا | idha | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Not declinable (mabni), introduces when-clause | when |
| 4 | يَغْشَاهَا | yaghshaha | غ-ش-ي | Verb - Form I, present, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in indicative (marfu'), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | it covers it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Tense Shift: Past vs. Present in the Oath Clauses">
Notice that verse 3 uses the past tense جَلَّاهَا but verse 4 uses the present tense يَغْشَاهَا. This is not arbitrary. The present tense here evokes the ongoing, recurring nature of night's covering -- it happens again and again, perpetually enveloping the world. The past tense in verse 3 may emphasize the completed, decisive act of daylight revealing. This subtle tense variation (iltifat) is a hallmark of Quranic eloquence.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The structure mirrors verses 2-3 but with a key difference: يَغْشَاهَا is in the present tense (mudari') rather than past. After إِذَا, present tense verbs retain their present/habitual meaning. The verb is marfu' (indicative), with a hidden pronoun (هُوَ) as subject and هَا as object.

**Sarf (Morphology):** اللَّيْلِ is from root ل-ي-ل on the فَعْل pattern. يَغْشَاهَا is Form I from root غ-ش-ي, a defective (naqis) verb. The present tense form follows the يَفْعَل pattern with the final radical becoming alif.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Night "covering" (يَغْشَى) the sun/earth creates a vivid metaphor of concealment, directly opposing day's "revealing" (جَلَّى). The pair day/night (نَهَار/لَيْل) echoes the cosmic duality theme. Night's covering is also a metaphor for spiritual blindness, foreshadowing the moral corruption discussed in verse 10.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالسَّمَاءِ وَمَا بَنَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-s-sama'i wa-ma banaha"
  translation="And [by] the sky and He who constructed it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:5"
  highlight="مَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | السَّمَاءِ | as-sama'i | س-م-و | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the sky/heaven |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Relative pronoun/particle (masdariyya or mawsuliyya) | Not declinable (mabni) in place of genitive | He who/what |
| 5 | بَنَاهَا | banaha | ب-ن-ي | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | He constructed it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="مَا as Relative Pronoun: Two Interpretations">
مَا in verses 5, 6, and 7 can be interpreted two ways: (1) as ism mawsul (relative pronoun) meaning "He who" -- referring to Allah as the One who built the sky, spread the earth, and proportioned the soul; or (2) as masdariyya meaning "the act of" -- swearing by the building itself. Most scholars prefer the first reading, treating مَا as equivalent to مَنْ ("He who"), which gives the oath a theological dimension beyond the physical.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The structure shifts from oath + temporal clause (verses 2-4) to oath + relative clause (verses 5-7). Both وَ particles here are oath particles, creating a double oath: by the sky and by its Creator. مَا introduces a relative clause (sila) with بَنَاهَا as the verb. The entire مَا بَنَاهَا phrase occupies the genitive position after the oath وَ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** السَّمَاءِ is from root س-م-و on the فَعَال pattern, a feminine noun. بَنَاهَا is Form I from root ب-ن-ي, a defective (naqis) verb whose final radical ي becomes alif in the past tense.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The oath now moves from natural phenomena (sun, moon, day, night) to creative acts (building the sky). The metaphor of "building" (بَنَى) for sky-creation is vivid -- it implies architecture, intention, and design. Pairing the creation with the Creator elevates the oath from the physical to the theological.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا طَحَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-l-ardi wa-ma tahaha"
  translation="And [by] the earth and He who spread it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:6"
  highlight="طَحَاهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | الْأَرْضِ | al-ardi | أ-ر-ض | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ | the earth |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Relative pronoun/particle (masdariyya or mawsuliyya) | Not declinable (mabni) in place of genitive | He who/what |
| 5 | طَحَاهَا | tahaha | ط-ح-و | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | He spread it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Cosmic Pairing: Sky and Earth">
Verses 5 and 6 form a perfect pair: السَّمَاءِ (sky) and الْأَرْضِ (earth), بَنَاهَا (constructed it) and طَحَاهَا (spread it). The sky is built upward; the earth is spread outward. This pairing of cosmic opposites (tibaq) is a recurring Quranic technique, emphasizing Allah's comprehensive creative power over everything above and below.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Parallel structure to verse 5: double oath (by the earth and by its Spreader). مَا طَحَاهَا is the relative clause, structurally identical to مَا بَنَاهَا. The parallelism between verses 5 and 6 is syntactically exact.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْأَرْضِ is from root أ-ر-ض, a feminine noun. طَحَاهَا is Form I from root ط-ح-و, a defective (naqis) verb meaning "to spread out, to flatten." This is a relatively rare root in the Quran.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** طَحَاهَا ("He spread it") evokes the image of earth being flattened and prepared for habitation -- a deliberate, purposeful act. The rare verb choice draws attention: this is not a common word, making the listener pause and reflect on the specific nature of earth's creation.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-nafsin wa-ma sawwaha"
  translation="And [by] the soul and He who proportioned it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:7"

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 2 | نَفْسٍ | nafsin | ن-ف-س | Noun - feminine, singular, indefinite | Genitive (majrur) after oath particle وَ, with tanwin kasratayn | a soul |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), oath particle | and [by] |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Relative pronoun/particle (masdariyya or mawsuliyya) | Not declinable (mabni) in place of genitive | He who/what |
| 5 | سَوَّاهَا | sawwaha | س-و-ي | Verb - Form II, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | He proportioned/perfected it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Indefinite Noun in an Oath: نَفْسٍ">
Unlike all the previous oath nouns (الشَّمْسِ, الْقَمَرِ, النَّهَارِ, etc.), which are definite with the article الـ, نَفْسٍ is indefinite (notice the tanwin). This indefiniteness is deliberate: it means "a soul" or "any soul" -- universalizing the statement to apply to every human being, not just a specific one. The shift from definite cosmic objects to an indefinite soul marks the climax of the oath series.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Same double-oath structure as verses 5-6, but with the crucial difference that نَفْسٍ is indefinite (مجرور بالكسرة الظاهرة مع التنوين). The tanwin on نَفْسٍ confirms its indefiniteness. سَوَّاهَا is the relative clause verb, with هَا referring back to نَفْس.

**Sarf (Morphology):** نَفْسٍ is from root ن-ف-س on the فَعْل pattern, a feminine noun meaning "soul, self." سَوَّاهَا is Form II from root س-و-ي, a doubly defective verb. Form II here conveys intensive meaning: not just "to make" but "to proportion, perfect, balance" -- implying careful, deliberate creation.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The oath series reaches its climax with the soul. The progression narrows from the cosmos (sun, moon) to time (day, night) to creation (sky, earth) to the human self (nafs). This telescoping structure guides the listener from the vast universe inward to the individual soul, which is the true subject of the surah. The indefiniteness of نَفْسٍ makes this deeply personal: this is about YOUR soul.

### Verse 8

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَلْهَمَهَا فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا"
  transliteration="fa-alhamaha fujuraha wa-taqwaha"
  translation="And inspired it [with discernment of] its wickedness and its righteousness"

| 2 | أَلْهَمَهَا | alhamaha | ل-ه-م | Verb - Form IV, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is first object | He inspired it |
| 3 | فُجُورَهَا | fujuraha | ف-ج-ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite + attached pronoun | Second object (maf'ul bihi thani) - accusative (mansub), هَا 3rd person pronoun in genitive | its wickedness |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IV Double Object: أَلْهَمَ">
أَلْهَمَهَا is a Form IV verb (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from root ل-ه-م. Form IV verbs often make intransitive roots transitive, or single-object verbs take two objects. Here أَلْهَمَ takes two objects: (1) the soul (هَا) and (2) its wickedness and righteousness (فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا). This grammatical structure means Allah did not just inspire the soul -- He inspired it WITH specific knowledge of right and wrong.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ connects this verse sequentially to verse 7: God proportioned the soul, THEN inspired it. أَلْهَمَهَا takes two objects (maf'ul bihi awwal and thani): the first is هَا (the soul) and the second is فُجُورَهَا وَتَقْوَاهَا (its wickedness and righteousness). تَقْوَاهَا is coordinated with فُجُورَهَا via وَ, both in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَلْهَمَ is Form IV from root ل-ه-م, with the characteristic hamza prefix (أَ). فُجُورَ is from root ف-ج-ر on the فُعُول pattern, a masdar meaning "wickedness, immorality." تَقْوَى is from root و-ق-ي on the فَعْلَى pattern, meaning "piety, God-consciousness, righteousness."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The order is significant: فُجُور (wickedness) is mentioned before تَقْوَى (righteousness). This is not because evil precedes good, but because recognizing what is wrong is the first step toward choosing what is right. The pairing creates perfect antithesis (tibaq), and the possessive pronouns (هَا) emphasize that every soul carries within it the knowledge of both paths.

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّاهَا"
  transliteration="qad aflaha man zakkaha"
  translation="He has succeeded who purifies it"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:9"
  highlight="قَدْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

| 1 | قَدْ | qad | - | Particle - emphasis | Not declinable (mabni), emphasizes past/perfect verb | certainly/indeed |
| 2 | أَفْلَحَ | aflaha | ف-ل-ح | Verb - Form IV, past, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb in past (mabni), answer to oath (jawab al-qasam) | he succeeded |
| 3 | مَن | man | - | Relative pronoun - indefinite | Not declinable (mabni), subject of أَفْلَحَ | who/whoever |
| 4 | زَكَّاهَا | zakkaha | ز-ك-و | Verb - Form II, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb in past (mabni), هَا 3rd person pronoun is object | he purified it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Jawab al-Qasam: Answer After Seven Oaths">
After seven consecutive oaths (verses 1-7), the answer (jawab al-qasam) finally arrives here in verse 9 with قَدْ أَفْلَحَ. The particle قَدْ before a past tense verb emphasizes certainty and completion -- "he has SURELY succeeded." This is the entire point the seven oaths were building toward: the purification of the soul is the measure of true success. The weight of seven cosmic oaths lends absolute authority to this moral declaration.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse is the jawab al-qasam (answer to the oath) for the entire series in verses 1-7. قَدْ precedes the past tense verb أَفْلَحَ to emphasize certainty and completion. مَن is a relative pronoun (ism mawsul) functioning as the subject (fa'il) of أَفْلَحَ. The relative clause زَكَّاهَا provides the condition for success. هَا refers to النَّفْس from verse 7.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَفْلَحَ is Form IV from root ف-ل-ح, with the causative/resultative meaning "to achieve success, to prosper." زَكَّاهَا is Form II from root ز-ك-و, with the intensive meaning "to purify, to cleanse, to make grow in righteousness." The doubled كّ indicates intensified, sustained effort at purification.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The simplicity of this verse after the elaborate oath series is itself rhetorical: after cosmic grandeur, a single, clear moral truth. The verb زَكَّى (Form II) implies not a one-time act but sustained, intensive purification -- a lifelong process. The use of مَن (whoever) universalizes the message, matching the indefinite نَفْسٍ in verse 7.

<Callout type="tip" title="Perfect Parallelism: Verses 9 and 10">
Verses 9 and 10 form a perfect grammatical mirror: قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن زَكَّاهَا // وَقَدْ خَابَ مَن دَسَّاهَا. Success vs. failure (أَفْلَحَ / خَابَ), purification vs. corruption (زَكَّاهَا / دَسَّاهَا). Both use قَدْ for emphasis, both use مَن as subject, and both end with Form II verbs acting on the soul (هَا). This structural symmetry drives home the binary moral choice.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Parallel to verse 9. وَ coordinates this verse with the previous one. قَدْ خَابَ mirrors قَدْ أَفْلَحَ. مَن is again the relative pronoun as subject. دَسَّاهَا is the relative clause verb with هَا as object referring to the soul. The entire verse is a mirror-image of verse 9.

**Sarf (Morphology):** خَابَ is Form I from root خ-ي-ب, a hollow verb meaning "to fail, to be disappointed." دَسَّاهَا is Form II from root د-س-س, originally meaning "to bury, to hide." The doubled سّ intensifies the meaning to "to corrupt, to conceal beneath layers of sin." Some scholars note the original form would be دَسَّسَهَا, with the final س changed to ا for phonetic ease.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verb دَسَّى carries a vivid metaphor: burying the soul under corruption, hiding its innate goodness. This contrasts with زَكَّى (purifying, making it grow) -- one verb lifts up, the other buries down. The antithesis is not just moral but spatial, evoking growth versus burial.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Feminine Verb with Collective Noun: كَذَّبَتْ ثَمُودُ">
ثَمُودُ is a tribal name treated as a feminine collective noun, which is why it takes the feminine verb كَذَّبَتْ (with the ta' marbuta suffix تْ). Tribal and national names in Arabic are often grammatically feminine because they implicitly refer to the "nation" (أُمَّة) or "tribe" (قَبِيلَة), both feminine nouns. Also note that ثَمُودُ is a diptote (ممنوع من الصرف) -- it takes damma without tanwin.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The surah shifts from universal moral truth (verses 9-10) to historical narrative (verses 11-15). كَذَّبَتْ is the main verb with ثَمُودُ as subject (fa'il, marfu'). بِطَغْوَاهَا is a prepositional phrase with causal بِ, meaning "because of their transgression." The implicit object of كَذَّبَتْ is their prophet Salih (not mentioned explicitly).

**Sarf (Morphology):** كَذَّبَ is Form II from root ك-ذ-ب. While Form I كَذَبَ means "to lie," Form II كَذَّبَ means "to deny, to reject, to accuse of lying" -- an intensified, transitive meaning. طَغْوَى is from root ط-غ-ي on the فَعْلَى pattern, a masdar meaning "transgression, exceeding bounds."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the abstract moral lesson (purify or corrupt your soul), the surah now provides a concrete historical example. Thamud exemplifies دَسَّاهَا -- they corrupted their souls through transgression, and the first manifestation was denial (تكذيب) of divine guidance. The causal بِ links their denial directly to their transgression: sin led to disbelief.

### Verse 12

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form VII Reflexive: انبَعَثَ">
انبَعَثَ is a Form VII verb (انْفَعَلَ pattern) from root ب-ع-ث. While بَعَثَ (Form I) means "to send," the reflexive Form VII انبَعَثَ means "to rise up of one's own accord, to be stirred into action." The form implies that the most wretched person was driven by inner impulse -- his corruption propelled him forward. This morphological nuance reinforces the surah's theme: the soul's state determines its actions.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِذِ is a temporal particle (different from إِذَا in the oath verses) introducing a past-time clause: "when..." It specifies the moment of Thamud's transgression. انبَعَثَ is the verb with أَشْقَاهَا as subject (fa'il, marfu'). The هَا pronoun refers to Thamud, and أَشْقَى is the superlative (ism tafdil) meaning "the most wretched of them."

**Sarf (Morphology):** انبَعَثَ is Form VII from root ب-ع-ث, with the characteristic نـ infix giving reflexive/passive meaning. أَشْقَاهَا follows the أَفْعَل superlative pattern from root ش-ق-ي, a defective root. The superlative form indicates the extreme degree of wretchedness.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The superlative أَشْقَاهَا singles out one individual from the tribe -- the embodiment of their collective corruption. Tradition identifies this as the man who hamstrung the she-camel. His rising (انبَعَثَ) is presented as the culmination of the tribe's moral decline: transgression produced denial, denial produced a champion of evil.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Implied Warning: نَاقَةَ اللَّهِ">
نَاقَةَ اللَّهِ is in the accusative case, but there is no explicit verb governing it. It is understood as an implied warning (tahdhir): "Beware of the she-camel of Allah!" or as the object of an implied verb like "Leave alone." This type of implied verb (fi'l mahdhuf) is a feature of concise Quranic style -- the urgency of the warning is so great that the verb is dropped, leaving only the object to carry the emotional weight.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ shows narrative sequence. قَالَ is the main verb with رَسُولُ اللَّهِ as subject (fa'il) in an idafa construction. لَهُمْ is the indirect object (to them). نَاقَةَ اللَّهِ is the object of an implied verb ( احذروا or ذروا), in the accusative as a warning (mahdhur). سُقْيَاهَا is coordinated with نَاقَةَ via وَ, also in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** رَسُولُ is from root ر-س-ل on the فَعُول pattern, meaning "one who is sent, messenger." نَاقَةَ is from root ن-و-ق on the فَاعِلَة pattern. سُقْيَا is from root س-ق-ي on the فُعْلَى pattern, a masdar meaning "the act of watering/drinking."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The attribution نَاقَةَ اللَّهِ ("the she-camel OF Allah") elevates the animal from ordinary property to a sacred sign. By linking the camel to Allah's name, any harm to it becomes a direct challenge to divine authority. The concise, verb-less warning conveys urgency -- as if Salih's words were a breathless plea.

<Callout type="rule" title="Five فَ Connectors: Rapid Narrative Cascade">
This verse contains five consecutive فَ particles, each marking a step in a rapid cause-and-effect chain: they denied him (فَكَذَّبُوهُ) --> they hamstrung her (فَعَقَرُوهَا) --> God destroyed them (فَدَمْدَمَ) --> because of their sin (بِذَنبِهِمْ) --> He leveled it (فَسَوَّاهَا). The فَ here is fa' al-ta'qib (the فَ of immediate sequence), conveying breathless rapidity: each event followed instantly upon the last, as if sin, punishment, and annihilation were a single unstoppable chain.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Quadriliteral Verb: دَمْدَمَ">
دَمْدَمَ is one of the rare quadriliteral verbs in the Quran, from the four-letter root د-م-د-م. It means "to destroy utterly, to bring crushing ruin." The reduplication of the root (د-م repeated twice) is itself onomatopoeic -- it sounds like rumbling, thundering destruction. This morphological intensity matches the severity of the divine punishment.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse is a chain of five فَ-connected clauses. كَذَّبُوهُ has an implicit subject (واو الجماعة) and هُ as object (Salih). عَقَرُوهَا similarly has واو as subject and هَا (the she-camel) as object. دَمْدَمَ has رَبُّهُم as explicit subject (fa'il), with عَلَيْهِمْ as prepositional complement. بِذَنبِهِمْ is a causal prepositional phrase. سَوَّاهَا has a hidden pronoun (هُوَ/Allah) as subject and هَا as object.

**Sarf (Morphology):** كَذَّبُوهُ is Form II (intensive denial). عَقَرُوهَا is Form I from root ع-ق-ر ("to hamstring, wound fatally"). دَمْدَمَ is a quadriliteral verb (فَعْلَلَ pattern) from root د-م-د-م. سَوَّاهَا is Form II from root س-و-ي, here meaning "to level, to make equal" (the destruction was complete and universal).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The narrative accelerates with staccato-like فَ particles, each event crashing into the next without pause. Note that سَوَّاهَا appeared in verse 7 meaning "He proportioned it" (creation), but here means "He leveled it" (destruction). This deliberate repetition with reversed meaning is a powerful rhetorical device: the God who perfects can also destroy. The same verb, two opposite outcomes.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Divine Sovereignty: لَا يَخَافُ">
The surah closes with a statement of absolute divine power: لَا يَخَافُ -- "He does not fear." The negation particle لَا with the present tense verb indicates permanent, ongoing negation: God never fears, has never feared, and will never fear any consequence of His actions. This is not merely about Thamud's destruction -- it is a universal declaration that divine justice operates without hesitation or concern for repercussion.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَ coordinates this clause with the preceding narrative. لَا is a negation particle (la al-nafiya) negating the present tense verb يَخَافُ. The subject is a hidden pronoun (هُوَ) referring to Allah. عُقْبَاهَا is the direct object (maf'ul bihi) in the accusative, with هَا referring to the destruction or the act of punishment.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَخَافُ is Form I from root خ-و-ف, a hollow verb (the middle radical و becomes alif in certain forms). عُقْبَى is from root ع-ق-ب on the فُعْلَى pattern, meaning "consequence, outcome, aftermath."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends not with the destruction itself but with a theological affirmation. After the devastating narrative of Thamud's annihilation, the final word belongs to God's sovereignty. The brevity of this closing verse -- just four words -- contrasts sharply with the verbose verse 14, creating a sense of calm authority after the storm of punishment. The message is unmistakable: divine justice is final and uncontested.

**1. وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا (Verse 1)**
- Noun: الشَّمْسِ -- genitive (majrur) after oath وَ
- Qualifier: وَضُحَاهَا -- coordinated noun (atf), no temporal/relative clause
- Relationship: The brightness is an attribute of the sun, linked by conjunction

**2. وَالْقَمَرِ إِذَا تَلَاهَا (Verse 2)**
- Noun: الْقَمَرِ -- genitive after oath وَ
- Qualifier: إِذَا temporal clause
- Relationship: The oath is by the moon AT THE TIME it follows the sun

**3. وَالنَّهَارِ إِذَا جَلَّاهَا (Verse 3)**
- Noun: النَّهَارِ -- genitive after oath وَ
- Qualifier: إِذَا temporal clause
- Relationship: The oath is by the day WHEN it reveals (Form II intensive)

**4. وَاللَّيْلِ إِذَا يَغْشَاهَا (Verse 4)**
- Noun: اللَّيْلِ -- genitive after oath وَ
- Qualifier: إِذَا temporal clause (present tense verb)
- Relationship: The oath is by the night WHEN it covers (habitual action)

**5. وَالسَّمَاءِ وَمَا بَنَاهَا (Verse 5)**
- Noun: السَّمَاءِ -- genitive after oath وَ
- Qualifier: وَمَا relative clause (He who built it)
- Relationship: Double oath -- by the sky AND by its Creator

**6. وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا طَحَاهَا (Verse 6)**
- Noun: الْأَرْضِ -- genitive after oath وَ
- Qualifier: وَمَا relative clause (He who spread it)
- Relationship: Double oath -- by the earth AND by its Spreader

**7. وَنَفْسٍ وَمَا سَوَّاهَا (Verse 7)**
- Noun: نَفْسٍ -- genitive after oath وَ (indefinite, with tanwin)
- Qualifier: وَمَا relative clause (He who proportioned it)
- Relationship: Double oath -- by the soul AND by its Perfecter

**Key patterns:** Verses 2-4 use إِذَا (temporal), verses 5-7 use مَا (relative). Verse 1 stands alone with a simple conjunction. The progression moves from observed phenomena (sun, moon, day, night) to creative acts (building, spreading, proportioning).
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the use of Form II verbs in this surah. List each Form II verb, its root, its Form I meaning, and how Form II changes or intensifies the meaning. What does the prevalence of Form II tell us about the surah's themes?">

**1. جَلَّاهَا (Verse 3) -- root: ج-ل-و**
- Form I جَلَا: "to reveal, uncover"
- Form II جَلَّى: "to display brilliantly, to make fully visible"
- Intensification: From simple revealing to complete, radiant display

**2. سَوَّاهَا (Verses 7, 14) -- root: س-و-ي**
- Form I سَوِيَ: "to be equal, level"
- Form II سَوَّى: "to proportion, perfect, balance" (v.7) / "to level, equalize destruction" (v.14)
- Intensification: From a state of equality to the active, deliberate act of making something perfect or leveling it

**3. زَكَّاهَا (Verse 9) -- root: ز-ك-و**
- Form I زَكَا: "to be pure, to grow"
- Form II زَكَّى: "to purify, to make righteous, to cause to grow"
- Intensification: From natural purity to active, sustained purification effort

**4. دَسَّاهَا (Verse 10) -- root: د-س-س**
- Form I دَسَّ: "to hide, insert"
- Form II (variant): "to bury, corrupt, conceal under layers"
- Intensification: From simple hiding to total corruption and burial of the soul

**5. كَذَّبَتْ / كَذَّبُوهُ (Verses 11, 14) -- root: ك-ذ-ب**
- Form I كَذَبَ: "to lie"
- Form II كَذَّبَ: "to deny, to reject, to accuse of lying"
- Intensification: From lying to actively rejecting truth and accusing the truthful

**Thematic significance:** The dominance of Form II verbs reveals that this surah is about INTENSIFIED actions -- not passive states but deliberate, forceful choices. Purification (زَكَّى) and corruption (دَسَّى) are not mild inclinations but vigorous commitments. Creation (سَوَّى) is not casual but meticulous. Denial (كَذَّبَ) is not passive doubt but active rejection. The surah's message is that the soul's fate depends on the INTENSITY of one's moral choices.

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Extended oath series (qasam):** Verses 1-7 feature one of the longest oath sequences in the Quran -- seven consecutive وَ oaths, each placing its noun in the genitive case, with the jawab al-qasam delayed until verse 9
- **Temporal clauses with إِذَا:** Verses 2, 3, and 4 use إِذَا to introduce when-clauses that qualify the oaths, specifying particular cosmic moments
- **Relative pronoun مَا:** Verses 5, 6, and 7 use مَا functioning as ism mawsul ("He who") or masdariyya ("the act of"), introducing relative clauses about divine creative acts
- **Emphasis particle قَدْ:** Verses 9 and 10 use قَدْ before past tense verbs to emphasize certainty and completion of the oath's answer
- **Form II verbs (فَعَّلَ -- intensive/causative):** A dominant pattern -- جَلَّاهَا, سَوَّاهَا, زَكَّاهَا, دَسَّاهَا, كَذَّبَتْ -- showing intensified, deliberate action that mirrors the surah's theme of active moral choice
- **Form IV verbs (أَفْعَلَ):** أَلْهَمَهَا (double object) and أَفْلَحَ (resultative success)
- **Form VII verb (انْفَعَلَ):** انبَعَثَ -- reflexive/passive meaning ("to rise up of one's own accord")
- **Superlative أَفْعَل pattern:** أَشْقَاهَا ("the most wretched of them")
- **Quadriliteral verb:** دَمْدَمَ (د-م-د-م) -- four-letter root with onomatopoeic force
- **Idafa constructions:** رَسُولُ اللَّهِ, نَاقَةَ اللَّهِ -- linking human/natural elements to divine authority
- **Rapid narrative with فَ:** Verse 14 chains five consecutive فَ particles for breathless cause-and-effect narration
- **Indefinite noun in oath:** نَفْسٍ (verse 7) is uniquely indefinite among the oath nouns, universalizing the message to every soul
- **Contrast structure (tibaq):** Verses 9-10 present perfect parallelism -- success vs. failure, purification vs. corruption -- as the surah's central moral binary

This surah is a masterclass in building rhetorical momentum through extended oath constructions, then delivering a concise moral verdict reinforced by historical example.
