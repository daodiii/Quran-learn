</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Surah Matters for Grammar">
Al-Fil is a masterpiece of narrative grammar in just 5 verses. It opens with the powerful أَلَمْ تَرَ rhetorical question (combining interrogative, negation, and jussive mood in one phrase), then shifts to sequential past tense narration connected by وَ and فَ. Verse 4 breaks the past tense pattern with a vivid present tense verb (تَرْمِيهِم), bringing the ancient event to life before the listener's eyes. The surah concludes with a devastating simile using a passive participle — a complete grammar lesson in storytelling technique.

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَلَمْ | alam | - | Particle - interrogative + negation | Interrogative particle with negation - not declinable | Did not? Have not? |
| 2 | تَرَ | tara | ر ا ي | Verb - Form I, present tense (jussive), 2nd person masculine singular | Jussive verb (fi'l mudari' majzum) after لَمْ - jussive (majzum) | You see |
| 3 | كَيْفَ | kayfa | - | Adverb - interrogative | Interrogative adverb - not declinable | How |

| 5 | رَبُّكَ | rabbuka | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine singular, definite + attached pronoun | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') with damma, + possessive pronoun genitive | Your Lord |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The أَلَمْ Construction: Three Particles in One">
أَلَمْ combines three grammatical elements: (1) **أَ** (hamzat al-istifham) — the interrogative particle, (2) **لَمْ** — the jussive/negation particle. Together they create a **rhetorical question expecting a positive answer**: "Did you not see?" = "You certainly saw!" لَمْ causes the present tense verb to take **jussive mood** (majzum): تَرَى → تَرَ (the alif/ya is dropped as the jussive marker for defective verbs).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** أَلَمْ governs the jussive verb تَرَ. The embedded question كَيْفَ فَعَلَ رَبُّكَ is the maf'ul bihi (object) of تَرَ — "have you not seen [HOW your Lord dealt...]?" The verb فَعَلَ takes رَبُّكَ as its fa'il (subject) and the prepositional phrase بِأَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ as its complement. أَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ is an idafah construction where أَصْحَاب is the broken plural of صَاحِب.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَرَ is from the defective root ر-ا-ي (weak middle and final radicals). In the jussive after لَمْ, the final ي/ا drops entirely: تَرَى → تَرَ. This is a key morphological rule: defective verbs lose their final weak letter in the jussive and imperative. رَبُّكَ from the doubled root ر-ب-ب shows the attached possessive pronoun كَ (your).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** أَلَمْ تَرَ is addressed to the Prophet, but the events predate his birth — he didn't literally "see" them. Using "seeing" for knowledge implies the event is so well-known it's as if everyone witnessed it. The question form engages the listener more powerfully than a statement would. Attributing the action to رَبُّكَ (YOUR Lord) personalizes divine protection.

### Verse 2

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَلَمْ | alam | - | Particle - interrogative + negation | Interrogative particle with negation - not declinable | Did not? |
| 2 | يَجْعَلْ | yaj'al | ج ع ل | Verb - Form I, present tense (jussive), 3rd person masculine singular | Jussive verb (fi'l mudari' majzum) after لَمْ - jussive with sukun | Make, render |
| 3 | كَيْدَهُمْ | kaydahum | ك ي د | Noun - masculine singular + attached pronoun | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with fatha, + possessive pronoun genitive | Their plot, scheme |
| 4 | فِي | fi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition - not declinable | In, into |
| 5 | تَضْلِيلٍ | tadlīlin | ض ل ل | Noun - verbal noun (masdar), masculine singular, indefinite | Object of preposition (majrur) - genitive with tanwin kasra | Misguidance, error, going astray |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="جَعَلَ with Double Complement">
جَعَلَ (to make/render) can take **two complements**: a direct object and a second complement showing what the object becomes. Here: يَجْعَلْ + كَيْدَهُمْ (object: their plot) + فِي تَضْلِيلٍ (result: into misguidance). This "make X into Y" structure is extremely common in the Quran. Compare verse 5: فَجَعَلَهُمْ (object: them) + كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ (result: like eaten straw).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Same أَلَمْ construction as verse 1, now with يَجْعَلْ in the jussive (shown by sukun on the final lam). The hidden subject is هُوَ (He, Allah). كَيْدَهُمْ is the first maf'ul bihi (direct object), and فِي تَضْلِيلٍ functions as the second complement — the result/state into which the plot was rendered.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَجْعَلْ shows clear jussive marking: the sukun on the lam (يَجْعَلْ vs. indicative يَجْعَلُ). كَيْد from root ك-ي-د on pattern فَعْل means plot or stratagem. تَضْلِيلٍ is a masdar (verbal noun) on pattern تَفْعِيل from the Form II verb ضَلَّلَ (to lead astray). The تَفْعِيل pattern is the standard masdar for Form II verbs.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The second أَلَمْ question reinforces the first, building certainty. The indefiniteness of تَضْلِيلٍ (with tanwin) suggests their plot didn't just fail — it went into complete, absolute misguidance. فِي (in) rather than إِلَى (toward) implies they were swallowed by their own error, surrounded by it, not merely heading toward it.

### Verse 3

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction - not declinable | And |
| 2 | أَرْسَلَ | arsala | ر س ل | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Predicate verb (fi'l madi) - indicative | Sent |
| 3 | عَلَيْهِمْ | 'alayhim | - | Preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun genitive | Upon them, against them |
| 4 | طَيْرًا | tayran | ط ي ر | Noun - masculine, collective/singular, indefinite | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with tanwin fatha | Birds |
| 5 | أَبَابِيلَ | abābīla | - | Noun - plural, indefinite | Hal (circumstantial state) or adjective - accusative (mansub) | In flocks, in groups |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form IV: أَرْسَلَ (to Send)">
أَرْسَلَ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) from root ر-س-ل. Form IV adds **causative/transitive** meaning: رَسَلَ doesn't exist as Form I in common usage, but the pattern gives "to send forth, to dispatch." Form IV is the most common verb form in the Quran after Form I, used for divine actions: أَنزَلَ (sent down), أَعْطَى (gave), أَهْلَكَ (destroyed).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَ connects this to the preceding rhetorical questions, shifting from question to narrative. أَرْسَلَ has a hidden subject (هُوَ, Allah). عَلَيْهِمْ is the prepositional phrase showing the target. طَيْرًا is the maf'ul bihi (direct object). أَبَابِيلَ is debated: it may be a hal (state/manner — "in flocks"), a sifah (adjective describing the birds), or a second maf'ul bihi. It's diptote (ممنوع من الصرف) — no tanwin despite being indefinite.

**Sarf (Morphology):** طَيْر from root ط-ي-ر is a collective noun (ism jam') — it can refer to one bird or many. أَبَابِيلَ is a rare plural form with no established singular in common usage. Scholars debate whether its singular is إِبَّالَة or إِبِّيل. The word is diptote because it follows the مَفَاعِيل pattern (a broken plural pattern that blocks tanwin).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from rhetorical questions (v1-2) to declarative narration (v3) moves the listener from reflection to re-witnessing the event. The preposition عَلَى (upon/against) rather than إِلَى (toward) conveys overwhelming force — the birds descended upon them, not merely flew toward them. The indefiniteness of طَيْرًا أَبَابِيلَ creates mystery: these are unspecified, unknown birds in successive waves — something beyond normal experience.

### Verse 4

| 1 | تَرْمِيهِم | tarmīhim | ر م ي | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person feminine singular + attached pronoun | Present verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu'), + object pronoun accusative | Strikes them, pelts them |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Present Tense in Past Narration (Hikayat al-Hal)">
The surah narrates a past event using past tense verbs (أَرْسَلَ، فَعَلَ، جَعَلَ), but verse 4 suddenly switches to **present tense**: تَرْمِيهِم ("they strike/are striking them"). This technique is called **hikayat al-hal** (narrating the state) — using present tense within a past narrative to make the scene vivid and immediate, as if the listener is watching it happen now. English does this too: "He walked in and — boom — she THROWS the book at him."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** تَرْمِيهِم is a verbal sentence functioning as a hal (circumstantial clause) describing the birds: "sent birds [while they were] striking them." The verb is feminine singular, agreeing with the collective طَيْرًا (treated as feminine). The attached pronoun هِم is the maf'ul bihi (direct object). بِحِجَارَةٍ is a prepositional phrase indicating the instrument. مِّن سِجِّيلٍ describes the material of the stones (bayāniyyah — explanatory مِن).

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَرْمِي from root ر-م-ي, Form I, with the feminine prefix تَـ agreeing with the collective noun. The original form would be تَرْمِيُ, but when a pronoun is attached, the damma is absorbed. حِجَارَة from root ح-ج-ر is a collective/plural noun. سِجِّيل has debated etymology — some scholars trace it to Persian (sang + gil = stone + clay), others to Arabic root س-ج-ل.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The vivid present tense pulls the listener into the scene. The double preposition chain (بِحِجَارَةٍ مِّن سِجِّيلٍ) creates a zooming-in effect: first we see stones, then we learn what they're made of. The instrument بِ + material مِن together paint a complete picture. These are not ordinary rocks but specially prepared projectiles — baked clay, hard and devastating.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ"
  transliteration="fa-ja'alahum ka-'asfin ma'kūlin"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Consequential conjunction - not declinable | So, then |
| 2 | جَعَلَهُمْ | ja'alahum | ج ع ل | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular + attached pronoun | Predicate verb (fi'l madi) + object pronoun accusative | Made them |

| 4 | عَصْفٍ | 'asfin | ع ص ف | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Object of preposition (majrur) - genitive with tanwin kasra | Straw, chaff |
| 5 | مَّأْكُولٍ | ma'kūlin | ا ك ل | Noun - passive participle, masculine singular, indefinite | Adjective describing 'asfin - genitive with tanwin kasra | Eaten, devoured |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Consequential فَ vs. Conjunctive وَ">
فَ (fa) indicates **result/consequence**, unlike وَ (wa) which simply coordinates. Compare: verse 3 uses وَأَرْسَلَ (وَ = "and" — adding another action), but verse 5 uses فَجَعَلَ (فَ = "so/therefore" — showing the result). The فَ tells us: BECAUSE He sent the birds (v3) which struck them (v4), THEREFORE He made them like eaten straw (v5). The conjunction choice carries logical meaning.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Passive Participle: مَأْكُول">
مَّأْكُولٍ is a **passive participle** (ism maf'ul) from أَكَلَ (to eat), on pattern مَفْعُول. Active participle: آكِل (one who eats). Passive participle: مَأْكُول (that which has been eaten). The passive participle describes the straw's state — not "straw that eats" but "straw that has been eaten." In Arabic, adjectives must agree with their nouns in case, gender, number, and definiteness: عَصْفٍ (genitive, masculine, singular, indefinite) + مَأْكُولٍ (genitive, masculine, singular, indefinite).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ introduces consequence. جَعَلَ takes two complements: the pronoun هُمْ (first object — "them") and كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ (second complement — "like eaten straw"). كَ is a preposition of comparison (harf tashbih). مَّأْكُولٍ is a sifah (adjective) for عَصْفٍ, matching it in all four agreement categories: case (genitive), gender (masculine), number (singular), definiteness (indefinite with tanwin).

**Sarf (Morphology):** عَصْف from root ع-ص-ف on pattern فَعْل means the dry leaves/husks of grain — straw or chaff. مَأْكُول on pattern مَفْعُول is the passive participle of أَكَلَ (to eat), root ا-ك-ل. The مَفْعُول pattern is the standard passive participle for Form I triliteral verbs.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The simile (tashbih) compares a mighty army to the most worthless thing imaginable: straw that has already been eaten and discarded. This is tashbih tamthili (illustrative simile) — it doesn't just say they were destroyed, it paints the image of hollowed-out, chewed husks scattered on the ground. The progression across the surah mirrors the army's fate: they came (v1) → their plot failed (v2) → birds were sent (v3) → stones struck them (v4) → they became nothing (v5). The narrative structure itself is a descent from power to annihilation.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="The surah uses three different verb tenses: past tense (فَعَلَ، أَرْسَلَ، جَعَلَ), jussive (تَرَ، يَجْعَلْ), and present tense (تَرْمِيهِم). Map each verb to its tense and explain the narrative reason for each tense choice.">

| Verb | Tense | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| تَرَ (v1) | **Jussive** (after لَمْ) | Negated present used in rhetorical question — "Have you not seen?" |
| فَعَلَ (v1) | **Past** | Reports what already happened — "how your Lord dealt" |
| يَجْعَلْ (v2) | **Jussive** (after لَمْ) | Negated present in rhetorical question — "Did He not make?" |
| أَرْسَلَ (v3) | **Past** | Narrative sequence — "He sent" |
| تَرْمِيهِم (v4) | **Present** | **Vivid narration** (hikayat al-hal) — brings the scene to life as if happening now |
| جَعَلَ (v5) | **Past** | Returns to past tense for the final result — "He made them" |

**Key insight:** The present tense in v4 is the dramatic center of the surah. Surrounded by past tense verbs, it creates a "slow-motion" effect: the listener is watching the birds strike in real time. This technique transforms historical narrative into lived experience.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the two uses of جَعَلَ in this surah (v2 and v5). Identify the direct object and second complement in each case, and explain how the meaning of جَعَلَ is the same but applied differently.">

**Verse 2: أَلَمْ يَجْعَلْ كَيْدَهُمْ فِي تَضْلِيلٍ**
- **Direct object:** كَيْدَهُمْ ("their plot") — accusative
- **Second complement:** فِي تَضْلِيلٍ ("into misguidance") — prepositional phrase
- **Meaning:** He made their plot [go] into misguidance (rendered it futile)

**Verse 5: فَجَعَلَهُمْ كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ**
- **Direct object:** هُمْ ("them") — accusative pronoun
- **Second complement:** كَعَصْفٍ مَّأْكُولٍ ("like eaten straw") — prepositional phrase
- **Meaning:** He made them [become] like eaten straw (physically destroyed)

**Comparison:** Both use جَعَلَ in its "render/transform" meaning (not its "create" or "begin" meanings). In v2, it transforms something abstract (a plot → misguidance). In v5, it transforms something physical (people → scattered remains). The progression from v2 to v5 shows total defeat: first their plans were destroyed, then they themselves were destroyed.

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Rhetorical أَلَمْ**: Combines interrogative أَ + negation/jussive لَمْ for questions expecting positive answers
- **Jussive mood after لَمْ**: تَرَ (from تَرَى, alif dropped) and يَجْعَلْ (sukun on final letter)
- **Embedded كَيْفَ question**: "How your Lord dealt" serves as the object of "seeing"
- **Idafah constructions**: أَصْحَابِ الْفِيلِ, رَبُّكَ showing possessive relationships
- **Form IV verb**: أَرْسَلَ (causative: to send forth) — the most common Quranic verb form after Form I
- **Present tense for vividness**: تَرْمِيهِم breaks past tense narration to bring the scene to life
- **Consequential فَ vs. coordinating وَ**: فَجَعَلَ shows result, وَأَرْسَلَ adds sequence
- **جَعَلَ with double complement**: "Make X into Y" — appears twice with different applications
- **Passive participle مَفْعُول**: مَّأْكُولٍ (eaten) describes the final, degraded state
- **Comparison with كَ**: كَعَصْفٍ (like straw) — simile construction
- **Adjective-noun agreement**: مَّأْكُولٍ agrees with عَصْفٍ in case, gender, number, and definiteness
