# ʿAbasa (He Frowned)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 42
- **Theme:** This surah addresses an incident where the Prophet ﷺ frowned at a blind man who interrupted him. It emphasizes the value of sincere seekers of guidance regardless of social status, then shifts to descriptions of creation, human ingratitude, and the Day of Judgment.
- **Grammar Focus:** Narrative past tense (3rd person shifting to 2nd person), interrogative constructions with *mā*, conditional *idhā*, sequential connectives (*fa-*, *thumma*), Form I through Form V verb forms, prepositional phrases with *min*, exclamatory *mā*, active participles, and relative clauses.
