# ʿAbasa (He Frowned)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 42
- **Theme:** This surah addresses an incident where the Prophet ﷺ frowned at a blind man who interrupted him. It emphasizes the value of sincere seekers of guidance regardless of social status, then shifts to descriptions of creation, human ingratitude, and the Day of Judgment.
- **Grammar Focus:** Narrative past tense (3rd person shifting to 2nd person), interrogative constructions with *mā*, conditional *idhā*, sequential connectives (*fa-*, *thumma*), Form I through Form V verb forms, prepositional phrases with *min*, exclamatory *mā*, active participles, and relative clauses.

<Callout type="tip" title="Surah Architecture">
Surah ʿAbasa is structured as a grammatical drama in five acts, each with its own distinctive syntax. It opens with a third-person narrative (verses 1-2) using past tense verbs — uniquely indirect for a divine address to the Prophet — then pivots sharply to second-person address with rhetorical interrogatives and *ammā...fa-* conditional constructions (verses 3-10), creating a paired contrast between the self-sufficient and the sincere seeker. The emphatic *kallā* at verse 11 resets the discourse to describe the Quran's sacred status through stacked passive participles in genitive chains (verses 13-16). A second *kallā* at verse 17 introduces the creation-ingratitude section, deploying the exclamatory *mā afʿalahu* pattern, rhetorical questions with *min ayyi*, and a *thumma/fa-* sequential chain that traces the human life cycle from sperm-drop to resurrection (verses 17-22). The agricultural passage (verses 24-32) showcases the jussive command *fa-l-yanẓur*, *mafʿūl muṭlaq* constructions for emphasis, and a remarkable seven-item enumeration of crops — all accusative objects governed by a single verb (*anbatnā*) six verses earlier. The surah culminates with an *idhā* conditional eschatological scene (verses 33-42) where nominal sentences with active participle predicates paint contrasting portraits of the blessed and the wretched. Throughout, the verb form distribution is telling: Form V reflexives (*tawallā*, *yazzakkā*, *talahhā*, *tasaddā*) dominate the moral section, Form IV causatives (*amāta*, *aqbara*, *anshara*, *anbatnā*) dominate the creation section, and active participles (*musfirah*, *ḍāḥikah*, *mustabshirah*) dominate the eschatological finale.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1


<ArabicExample
  arabic="عَبَسَ وَتَوَلَّىٰ"
  transliteration="ʿabasa wa-tawallā"
  translation="He frowned and turned away"
  reference="'Abasa 80:1"
  highlight="عَبَسَ,وَتَوَلَّىٰ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | عَبَسَ | ʿabasa | ع ب س | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb - marfu' (indicative mood in past) | He frowned |
| 2 | وَ | wa- | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable, connects verbs | And |
| 3 | تَوَلَّىٰ | tawallā | و ل ي | Verb - Form V, past, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb - marfu' (indicative mood in past) | He turned away |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse consists of two verbal sentences joined by the conjunction *wa-*. Both verbs are past tense, third person masculine singular, with the subject (the Prophet) understood from the verb conjugation rather than stated explicitly. This is a standard Arabic verbal sentence structure where the implied pronoun (*ḍamīr mustatir*) serves as the fāʿil.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *ʿAbasa* is a Form I verb on the *faʿala* pattern from root ع-ب-س, denoting a simple action of frowning. *Tawallā* is a Form V verb from root و-ل-ي, where the *ta-* prefix and *tashdīd* on the middle radical create the reflexive meaning: he turned himself away. The alif maqṣūrah ending reflects the weak final radical (*yāʾ*).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah's opening is strikingly unusual in the Quran: Allah addresses the Prophet in the third person rather than the second, creating a narrative distance that itself conveys gentle reproach. The choice of *ʿabasa* (frowned) before *tawallā* (turned away) presents the visible expression before the physical action, painting a vivid image. The absence of any explicit subject adds to the dramatic effect — the listener must discover who is being described.

### Verse 2


<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَن جَآءَهُ ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ"
  transliteration="an jāʾahu l-aʿmā"
  translation="Because the blind man came to him"
  reference="'Abasa 80:2"
  highlight="جَآءَهُ,ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَن | an | - | Particle - causal/reason | Not declinable, introduces reason clause | Because |
| 2 | جَآءَهُ | jāʾahu | ج ي ء | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + attached pronoun | Verb + pronoun as object (mansub) | Came to him |
| 3 | ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ | al-aʿmā | ع م ي | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Subject (fāʿil) - nominative (marfūʿ) | The blind one |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The particle *an* here is *an al-maṣdariyyah* (the causal *an*), introducing the reason for the actions in verse 1. The verb *jāʾa* takes two arguments: the attached pronoun *-hu* as the object (manṣūb), and the definite noun *al-aʿmā* as the subject (fāʿil, marfūʿ). The subject is placed after the verb in standard verbal sentence word order.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Jāʾahu* contains the hollow verb *jāʾa* (root ج-ي-ء) with a suffixed pronoun. *Al-aʿmā* follows the *afʿal* pattern, which in Arabic designates physical defects or distinctive characteristics (*ṣifah mushabbahah*). It derives from root ع-م-ي and functions as a noun despite its adjectival origin, with the alif maqṣūrah reflecting the weak final radical.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Rather than naming the blind companion (ʿAbdullāh ibn Umm Maktūm), the Quran identifies him only by his disability — *al-aʿmā*, the blind one. This is not dismissive but rather rhetorically purposeful: it highlights that the very quality that might cause someone to dismiss him (blindness) is the quality Allah foregrounds, making the Prophet's reaction all the more poignant. The causal *an* directly links frowning to the man's arrival, making the cause-effect inescapable.

### Verse 3


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا يُدْرِيكَ لَعَلَّهُۥ يَزَّكَّىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-mā yudrīka laʿallahu yazzakkā"
  translation="But what would make you perceive, [O Muhammad], that perhaps he might be purified?"

| 1 | وَ | wa- | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable | And |
| 2 | مَا | mā | - | Particle - interrogative | Not declinable, introduces rhetorical question | What |
| 3 | يُدْرِيكَ | yudrīka | د ر ي | Verb - Form IV, present, 3rd person masculine singular + attached pronoun | Verb + pronoun as object (mansub) | Makes you know |
| 4 | لَعَلَّهُۥ | laʿallahu | - | Particle - hoping/expectation + pronoun | *Laʿalla* governs accusative, pronoun is its ism | Perhaps he |
| 5 | يَزَّكَّىٰ | yazzakkā | ز ك و | Verb - Form V, present, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb in subjunctive (mansub) after *laʿalla* | Purifies himself |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse marks a dramatic shift from third to second person address. The interrogative *mā* introduces a rhetorical question, functioning as the subject (mubtadaʾ), while *yudrīka* is the predicate (khabar). The particle *laʿalla* is a sister of *inna* — it governs its *ism* in the accusative (the attached pronoun *-hu*) and its *khabar* in the nominative (the verbal clause *yazzakkā*). The verb *yazzakkā* is in the subjunctive mood after *laʿalla*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yudrīka* is a Form IV present tense verb from root د-ر-ي, where the *afʿala* pattern creates a causative meaning: to make someone know/perceive. The suffixed *-ka* is the second person object pronoun. *Yazzakkā* is a Form V present tense from root ز-ك-و, where the *tafaʿʿala* pattern produces a reflexive meaning: to purify oneself. The original form would be *yatazakkā*, but assimilation (*idghām*) of the *tāʾ* into the *zāy* produces *yazzakkā*.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The abrupt shift from third person (*ʿabasa*) to second person (*yudrīka*) is rhetorically powerful — Allah moves from narrating about the Prophet to speaking directly to him, intensifying the moral lesson. The rhetorical question *mā yudrīka* implies: "You cannot know the unseen — perhaps this blind man's heart held more purity than you realized." The use of *laʿalla* (perhaps) rather than a definitive statement preserves the gentleness of the admonishment.

### Verse 4


<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَوْ يَذَّكَّرُ فَتَنفَعَهُ ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ"
  transliteration="aw yadhdhakkaru fa-tanfaʿahu l-dhikrā"
  translation="Or be reminded and the remembrance would benefit him?"
  reference="'Abasa 80:4"
  highlight="يَذَّكَّرُ,فَتَنفَعَهُ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَوْ | aw | - | Particle - conjunction (or) | Not declinable | Or |
| 2 | يَذَّكَّرُ | yadhdhakkaru | ذ ك ر | Verb - Form V, present, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb in subjunctive (mansub), coordinate with verse 3 | He takes heed |
| 3 | فَ | fa- | - | Particle - connective (result) | Not declinable | So/then |
| 4 | تَنفَعَهُ | tanfaʿahu | ن ف ع | Verb - Form I, present, 3rd person feminine singular + pronoun | Verb in subjunctive (mansub) + object pronoun | Benefits him |
| 5 | ٱلذِّكْرَىٰ | al-dhikrā | ذ ك ر | Noun - feminine singular, definite | Subject (fāʿil) - nominative (marfūʿ) | The remembrance |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The conjunction *aw* (or) coordinates this verse with the preceding one, presenting a second possible outcome. The *fa-* before *tanfaʿahu* introduces a result clause (sabab wa-natījah): if he takes heed, *then* the remembrance benefits him. The subject *al-dhikrā* is feminine, requiring the feminine verb form *tanfaʿa* (with tāʾ prefix). The pronoun *-hu* is the object of *tanfaʿa*, referring back to the blind man.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yadhdhakkaru* is Form V present tense from root ذ-ك-ر, with the same assimilation pattern as *yazzakkā*: the original *yatadhakkaru* becomes *yadhdhakkaru* through *idghām* of the *tāʾ* into the *dhāl*. *Al-dhikrā* is a verbal noun of the *fiʿlā* pattern, a feminine form denoting the act or concept of remembrance. *Tanfaʿahu* is a Form I verb from root ن-ف-ع with the feminine prefix *ta-*.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse presents two ascending possibilities for the blind man: purification (*yazzakkā*, verse 3) or remembrance (*yadhdhakkaru*). The *fa-* result clause creates a cause-effect chain that emphasizes the value of sincere seeking — even the act of remembering leads to tangible benefit. The personification of *al-dhikrā* as the agent that benefits (*tanfaʿahu*) elevates remembrance from a passive state to an active force.

### Verse 5


<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَمَّا مَنِ ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ"
  transliteration="ammā mani staghnā"
  translation="As for he who considers himself without need"
  reference="'Abasa 80:5"
  highlight="أَمَّا,ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَمَّا | ammā | - | Particle - conditional topic marker | Not declinable, introduces conditional topic | As for |
| 2 | مَنِ | man | - | Relative pronoun - masculine | Refers to person, in place of subject | He who |
| 3 | ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ | istaghná | غ ن ي | Verb - Form X, past, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb - relative clause predicate | Considered himself self-sufficient |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Ammā* is a composite particle that functions as a conditional topic marker, meaning "as for." It requires a *fa-* in its response clause (apodosis), which appears in verse 6. The relative pronoun *man* serves as the topic (mawṣūl) in an indefinite sense — "whoever" or "he who." The verb *istaghná* is the predicate of the relative clause, with its subject being the implied pronoun referring back to *man*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Istaghná* is a Form X past tense verb from root غ-ن-ي. The *istafʿala* pattern typically conveys seeking or considering oneself to possess a quality: here, considering oneself *ghanī* (rich, self-sufficient). The alif maqṣūrah ending reflects the weak final radical. This form is significant because it indicates the arrogance is self-perceived, not necessarily real.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The *ammā...fa-* construction initiates one of the Quran's most powerful contrasts. By using *ammā*, the discourse shifts from narrative to structured argumentation — setting up two categories of people for comparison. The choice of Form X *istaghná* over simpler forms like *ghaniya* is rhetorically deliberate: the self-referential nature of Form X exposes the arrogance as self-delusion rather than reality. The wealthy Qurayshī leader *considers himself* self-sufficient, but true self-sufficiency belongs only to Allah.

### Verse 6


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَنتَ لَهُۥ تَصَدَّىٰ"
  transliteration="fa-anta lahu taṣaddā"
  translation="To him you give attention"
  reference="'Abasa 80:6"
  highlight="فَأَنتَ,لَهُۥ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa- | - | Particle - connective (result/response) | Not declinable | Then/so |
| 2 | أَنتَ | anta | - | Pronoun - 2nd person masculine singular, detached | Subject (mubtadaʾ) - nominative (marfūʿ) | You |
| 3 | لَهُۥ | lahu | - | Preposition + pronoun | Prepositional phrase, related to verb | To him |
| 4 | تَصَدَّىٰ | tasaddā | ص د ي | Verb - Form V, present, 2nd person masculine singular | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfūʿ) | Give attention/turn to |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The *fa-* introduces the apodosis (jawāb) of the *ammā* construction from verse 5. The sentence is nominal: *anta* is the mubtadaʾ (subject, marfūʿ), and the verbal clause *tasaddā* is the khabar (predicate). The prepositional phrase *lahu* (to him) is placed between the subject and predicate, specifying the object of attention and creating emphasis through fronting.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Tasaddā* is a Form V present tense verb from root ص-د-ي, on the *tafaʿʿalā* pattern. The *ta-* prefix and doubled middle radical create a reflexive/intensive meaning: to direct oneself toward, to give one's full attention to. The alif maqṣūrah ending again reflects the weak final radical (*yāʾ*). The detached pronoun *anta* is used instead of just the verb conjugation for added emphasis.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The nominal sentence structure with the explicit pronoun *anta* (you) is more emphatic than simply using the verb alone — it singles out the Prophet personally for this address. The placement of *lahu* before the verb creates a sense of prioritization: "to him — you give attention," highlighting the misplaced focus. This verse parallels verse 10 in structure (*fa-anta... [preposition] + verb*), creating a mirror that contrasts attention given to the wrong person versus attention withheld from the right one.

### Verse 7


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا عَلَيْكَ أَلَّا يَزَّكَّىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-mā ʿalayka allā yazzakkā"
  translation="But what concern is it of yours if he will not be purified?"
  reference="'Abasa 80:7"
  highlight="وَمَا,عَلَيْكَ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa- | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable | And |
| 2 | مَا | mā | - | Particle - negative (nothing) | Not declinable | Not/nothing |
| 3 | عَلَيْكَ | ʿalayka | - | Preposition + pronoun | Prepositional phrase | Upon you |
| 4 | أَلَّا | allā | - | Particle - *an* (that) + *lā* (not) | Introduces negative complement clause | That... not |
| 5 | يَزَّكَّىٰ | yazzakkā | ز ك و | Verb - Form V, present, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb in subjunctive (mansub) after *an* | He purifies himself |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a rhetorical question using a nominal sentence structure. *Mā* is the interrogative/negative particle functioning as mubtadaʾ, and the prepositional phrase *ʿalayka* is the khabar (predicate). The particle *allā* is a contraction of *an* + *lā*: *an* is the *maṣdariyyah* particle that introduces a complement clause and governs the subjunctive, while *lā* negates the verb. Thus *yazzakkā* appears in the subjunctive (manṣūb) after *an*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *ʿAlayka* combines the preposition *ʿalā* with the second person attached pronoun *-ka*. The contraction *allā* from *an lā* is a common morphophonemic process in Arabic. *Yazzakkā* is the same Form V verb seen in verse 3 (root ز-ك-و), again showing the assimilation of *tāʾ* into *zāy*, now in the subjunctive mood though the form appears identical due to the weak final radical.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The idiomatic expression *mā ʿalayka* powerfully communicates the limits of the Prophet's responsibility. The rhetorical question expects no answer — it is a statement disguised as a question for greater impact. By asking "what is upon you if he does not purify himself?", Allah simultaneously absolves the Prophet of responsibility for others' guidance and implies that his attention should be directed toward those who actively seek it, not those who consider themselves self-sufficient.

### Verse 8


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَمَّا مَن جَآءَكَ يَسْعَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-ammā man jāʾaka yasʿā"
  translation="But as for he who came to you striving"

| 5 | يَسْعَىٰ | yasʿā | س ع ي | Verb - Form I, present, 3rd person masculine singular | Verb as circumstantial clause (hāl) | Striving/hastening |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse mirrors verse 5 as the second part of the *ammā...fa-* contrast structure, with *wa-ammā* introducing the counterpart topic. The relative pronoun *man* is again the topic, and *jāʾaka* is the predicate of the relative clause, with the suffixed *-ka* as its object. The verb *yasʿā* functions as a *hāl* (circumstantial clause), describing the manner in which he came — striving. A *hāl* clause describes the state of the subject during the main action.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Jāʾaka* is a Form I hollow verb (root ج-ي-ء) with a second person object pronoun. *Yasʿā* is a Form I present tense from root س-ع-ي, a defective verb with the weak final radical *yāʾ* appearing as alif maqṣūrah. The present tense form is used despite the past context — this is a common Arabic device where the present tense in a *hāl* clause vividly depicts an ongoing state at the time of the past action.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The addition of *wa-* before *ammā* in verse 8 (absent in verse 5) creates an adversative nuance — "but as for..." — emphasizing the contrast between the two categories. The use of present tense *yasʿā* (striving) in a past narrative context is rhetorically vivid: it paints the blind man as perpetually striving, making his effort a defining characteristic rather than a one-time action. The word *yasʿā* implies physical exertion — a blind man hastening through the streets of Mecca — which intensifies the pathos of the scene.

### Verse 9


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَهُوَ يَخْشَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-huwa yakhshā"
  translation="While he fears [Allah]"
  reference="'Abasa 80:9"

| 3 | يَخْشَىٰ | yakhshā | خ ش ي | Verb - Form I, present, 3rd person masculine singular | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfūʿ) | Fears |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence where the detached pronoun *huwa* serves as the mubtadaʾ (subject, marfūʿ) and the verbal clause *yakhshā* as the khabar (predicate). The conjunction *wa-* connects this to the previous verse as an additional circumstantial description (*ḥāl*) — a *jumlah ḥāliyyah* that describes the state of the blind man as he came striving. The object of *yakhshā* (Allah) is understood from context.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yakhshā* is a Form I present tense verb from the defective root خ-ش-ي, on the *yafʿalu* pattern. The weak final radical *yāʾ* manifests as alif maqṣūrah. The detached pronoun *huwa* is used (rather than leaving the subject implicit in the verb) to create emphasis — "he (himself) fears," highlighting this as a defining quality.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The brevity of this verse — just two words in Arabic — is itself rhetorically powerful. After the descriptive verse 8 with its multiple clauses, this short declarative statement delivers the blind man's essential quality with maximum impact: he fears Allah. The choice of *yakhshā* (reverent fear/awe) over *yakhāfu* (ordinary fear) is significant: *khashyah* in Quranic usage implies fear combined with knowledge and reverence, marking the blind man as spiritually discerning despite his physical blindness.

### Verse 10


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَنتَ عَنْهُ تَلَهَّىٰ"

| 4 | تَلَهَّىٰ | talahhā | ل ه و | Verb - Form V, present, 2nd person masculine singular | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfūʿ) | Are distracted |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The *fa-* introduces the apodosis (jawāb) of the *ammā* construction from verse 8, completing the second conditional pair. The sentence structure is identical to verse 6: nominal sentence with *anta* as mubtadaʾ and the verbal clause *talahhā* as khabar. The prepositional phrase *ʿanhu* (from him) is placed between subject and predicate, specifying the person from whom the Prophet is distracted.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Talahhā* is a Form V present tense verb from root ل-ه-و. The original root conveys amusement and diversion; the Form V *tafaʿʿala* pattern creates a reflexive meaning: to divert oneself, become distracted. The transformation from *lahā* (root meaning) to *talahhā* shows the typical Form V doubling of the middle radical and the *ta-* prefix.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The structural parallelism between verse 6 (*fa-anta lahu tasaddā*) and verse 10 (*fa-anta ʿanhu talahhā*) is a masterful rhetorical device. Both share the pattern *fa-anta + preposition + verb*, but with inverted meanings: *lahu* (toward him) versus *ʿanhu* (away from him), *tasaddā* (give attention) versus *talahhā* (be distracted). This chiastic contrast forces the listener to compare the two behaviors and recognize the inversion of priorities. The preposition *ʿan* (away from) carries the emotional weight of turning away from someone deserving.

### Verse 11


<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَلَّآ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌۭ"
  transliteration="kallā innahā tadhkiratun"
  translation="No! Indeed, these verses are a reminder"

| 3 | تَذْكِرَةٌۭ | tadhkiratun | ذ ك ر | Noun - feminine singular, indefinite | Predicate of *inna* (khabar) - nominative (marfūʿ) | A reminder |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Kallā* is an emphatic particle of rebuke and negation that stands independently, closing the previous section. The sentence *innahā tadhkiratun* follows *inna* syntax: the attached pronoun *-hā* is the ism of *inna* (accusative), and *tadhkiratun* is the khabar of *inna* (nominative, marfūʿ with ḍammah). The pronoun *-hā* refers to the Quranic message, understood as feminine from context.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Tadhkiratun* derives from root ذ-ك-ر on the *tafʿilah* pattern, which is the verbal noun pattern for Form II verbs. It means "a reminder" or "an admonition" — the *tāʾ marbūṭah* ending makes it a feminine unit noun (one instance of reminding). The indefiniteness (shown by tanwīn) here serves to amplify rather than diminish: "a [great/important] reminder."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The particle *kallā* creates a sharp rhetorical break, like a slap of attention, transitioning from the rebuke section to a declaration about the Quran's nature. The combination of *kallā* + *inna* creates a double emphasis: "Absolutely not! Indeed..." The choice to call the Quran *tadhkirah* (reminder) rather than *kitāb* (book) or *waḥy* (revelation) is deliberate — it echoes the root ذ-ك-ر that appeared in verses 3-4 (*yazzakkā*, *yadhdhakkaru*, *al-dhikrā*), creating thematic cohesion around the concept of remembrance.

### Verse 12


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَمَن شَآءَ ذَكَرَهُۥ"
  transliteration="fa-man shāʾa dhakarahu"
  translation="So whoever wills may remember it"
  reference="'Abasa 80:12"

| 4 | ذَكَرَهُۥ | dhakarahu | ذ ك ر | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb - apodosis + object pronoun | Remembers it |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a conditional sentence using *man* as the conditional relative pronoun. The protasis (condition) is *man shāʾa* and the apodosis (result) is *dhakarahu*. Both verbs are in the past tense, which is the standard Arabic pattern for conditional sentences with *man* — the past tense here conveys a general present/future meaning ("whoever wills, let him remember"). The *fa-* before *man* connects this consequence to the preceding declaration.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Shāʾa* is a Form I hollow verb from root ش-ي-ء, where the weak middle radical *yāʾ* transforms to alif in the past tense. *Dhakarahu* is Form I from root ذ-ك-ر with the attached object pronoun *-hu*. The pronoun refers back to the feminine *tadhkirah* but uses the masculine form, as *-hu* can refer to the concept or content of the reminder rather than the grammatically feminine word itself.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse is a powerful declaration of human free will and personal accountability. The conditional structure places the initiative entirely with the individual: the reminder exists (verse 11), but remembering is a choice. The simplicity and brevity of the verse — just four words — mirrors its message: the path is clear and uncomplicated. The *fa-* connecting it to *kallā innahā tadhkiratun* creates a logical chain: it is a reminder, *therefore* whoever wills may take heed.

### Verse 13


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فِى صُحُفٍۢ مُّكَرَّمَةٍۢ"
  transliteration="fī ṣuḥufin mukarramatin"
  translation="In honored sheets [scriptures]"
  reference="'Abasa 80:13"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase *fī ṣuḥufin* describes the location or medium of the *tadhkirah* from verse 11. *Ṣuḥufin* is genitive (majrūr) after the preposition *fī*. The adjective *mukarramatin* agrees with *ṣuḥuf* in gender (feminine), number (plural), case (genitive with kasrah), and definiteness (both indefinite with tanwīn). This begins a chain of adjectives spanning verses 13-14.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ṣuḥuf* is the broken plural of *ṣaḥīfah* (page, sheet, scroll), following an irregular plural pattern. *Mukarramah* is a Form II passive participle from root ك-ر-م on the *mufaʿʿalah* pattern — the doubling of the middle radical is characteristic of Form II, and the *mu-* prefix with *fatḥah* on the second radical marks it as passive (honored, made noble) rather than active.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from abstract concept (*tadhkirah*, reminder) to physical medium (*ṣuḥuf*, pages) grounds the revelation in tangible reality. The adjective *mukarramah* is the first in a series of four adjectives (across verses 13-14) that build an ascending description of the sacred scriptures — honored, exalted, purified — each adding a new dimension of sanctity. The indefiniteness of *ṣuḥuf* paradoxically adds grandeur: these are not just specific pages but transcendent, celestial scrolls beyond ordinary definition.

### Verse 14


<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَّرْفُوعَةٍۢ مُّطَهَّرَةٍۭ"
  transliteration="marfūʿatin muṭahharatin"
  translation="Exalted and purified"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *marfūʿatin* and *muṭahharatin* are adjectives (naʿt) agreeing with *ṣuḥufin* from verse 13. They maintain genitive case (majrūr with kasrah tanwīn) to match their described noun. All four adjectives across verses 13-14 form a single descriptive chain modifying the same noun, demonstrating how Arabic can stack multiple adjectives while maintaining case agreement.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Marfūʿah* is a Form I passive participle from root ر-ف-ع on the *mafʿūlah* pattern — raised, exalted. *Muṭahharah* is a Form II passive participle from root ط-ه-ر on the *mufaʿʿalah* pattern — purified, cleansed. The Form II passive participle pattern (*mu-* prefix, doubled middle radical, *fatḥah* on second radical) appears in both *mukarramah* (verse 13) and *muṭahharah*, while *marfūʿah* follows the simpler Form I pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The accumulation of passive participles — honored, raised, purified — creates an escalating sense of sanctity. Each participle implies a divine Agent who has performed the action: God honored these pages, God raised them, God purified them. The passive voice conceals the Agent for reverential effect, a common Quranic device. The sequence moves from social honor (*mukarramah*) to spatial elevation (*marfūʿah*) to spiritual purity (*muṭahharah*), encompassing every dimension of holiness.

### Verse 15


<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِأَيْدِى سَفَرَةٍۢ"
  transliteration="bi-aydī safaratin"
  translation="In the hands of messenger-angels"
  reference="'Abasa 80:15"

| 3 | سَفَرَةٍۢ | safaratin | س ف ر | Noun - plural, indefinite | Genitive (majrūr) in iḍāfah construction | Scribes/messengers |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase *bi-aydī safaratin* further describes the *ṣuḥuf*, indicating who carries them. The preposition *bi-* governs *aydī* in the genitive. *Aydī safaratin* is an iḍāfah (possessive/construct state) construction: *aydī* is the muḍāf and *safaratin* is the muḍāf ilayhi (genitive). Because *aydī* is in the construct state (iḍāfah), it loses its plural ending *-īna* and appears as *-ī*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Aydī* is the plural of *yad* (hand), an irregular plural from root ي-د-ي. In construct state, the sound masculine plural ending *-ūna/-īna* reduces to *-ī/-ay*. *Safarah* is the plural of *safīr* (messenger, scribe, ambassador), from root س-ف-ر, on the *faʿalah* pattern which is a common broken plural for agent nouns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** By specifying that the sacred pages are *in the hands* of messenger-angels, the verse creates a vivid image of physical custody and care. The word *safarah* (scribes/ambassadors) emphasizes the intermediary role of the angels — they are both writers who record and messengers who transmit. The iḍāfah construction *aydī safarah* (hands of scribes) adds a tactile, physical dimension to what could have been a purely abstract description of revelation.

### Verse 16


<ArabicExample
  arabic="كِرَامٍۭ بَرَرَةٍۢ"
  transliteration="kirāmin bararatin"
  translation="Noble and dutiful"
  reference="'Abasa 80:16"

| 2 | بَرَرَةٍۢ | bararatin | ب ر ر | Adjective - masculine plural, indefinite | Adjective agreeing with *safarah* - genitive (majrūr) | Righteous/dutiful |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *kirāmin* and *bararatin* are adjectives (naʿt) describing *safaratin* from verse 15. They agree in case (genitive, majrūr with kasrah tanwīn) and definiteness (both indefinite). The adjectives follow the described noun, as is standard in Arabic attributive adjective placement.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Kirām* is the broken plural of *karīm* (noble, generous) from root ك-ر-م, on the *fiʿāl* pattern which is a common plural form for *faʿīl* adjectives. *Bararah* is the plural of *barr* (righteous, dutiful) from root ب-ر-ر, on the *faʿalah* pattern. Both are sound broken plurals serving as adjectives for rational beings (angels).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The description of the angelic scribes with two weighty adjectives — noble and righteous — serves a dual rhetorical purpose. First, it elevates the status of the Quranic message by association: if its bearers are noble and righteous, how much more exalted is the message itself. Second, the choice of *kirām* (nobility of character) and *bararah* (righteousness of deed) presents a complete moral portrait — inner quality and outward conduct. This passage (verses 13-16) forms a concentric structure: pages (outer) described by adjectives, carried by hands of angels (inner) described by adjectives, creating layers of sanctity around the divine message.

### Verse 17


<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُتِلَ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ مَآ أَكْفَرَهُۥ"
  transliteration="qutila l-insānu mā akfarahu"
  translation="Destroyed is man; how disbelieving is he!"

| 4 | أَكْفَرَهُۥ | akfarahu | ك ف ر | Verb - Form IV, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Exclamatory verb + object pronoun | More disbelieving he is! |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse contains two distinct grammatical constructions. First, *qutila l-insānu* is a passive verbal sentence where *al-insānu* functions as nāʾib al-fāʿil (deputy of the agent, nominative). Second, *mā akfarahu* follows the exclamatory *taʿajjub* pattern: *mā* is the exclamatory particle, *akfara* is the Form IV verb used in the exclamatory construction, and *-hu* is the object pronoun. The pattern *mā afʿalahu* is a fixed syntactic formula meaning "how [quality] he is!"

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Qutila* is the passive voice of *qatala* (Form I, root ق-ت-ل), marked by the *ḍammah-kasrah* vowel pattern characteristic of passive past tense (*fuʿila*). *Akfarahu* uses the Form IV *afʿala* pattern from root ك-ف-ر, but here it does not carry its usual causative meaning — in the exclamatory construction, it is a frozen form expressing intensity of the quality.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The passive *qutila* is not literal killing but an imprecatory expression — a curse formula meaning "may he be destroyed/perish." This jarring opening to the creation section shocks the listener into attention. The exclamatory *mā akfarahu* then channels that shock into moral reflection. The juxtaposition of a curse (*qutila*) with an exclamation of disbelief (*mā akfarahu*) creates a powerful emotional register that sets up the rhetorical question of verse 18: given such ingratitude, from what humble substance was this arrogant being even created?

### Verse 18


<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِنْ أَىِّ شَىْءٍ خَلَقَهُۥ"
  transliteration="min ayyi shayʾin khalaqahu"
  translation="From what substance did He create him?"

| 4 | خَلَقَهُۥ | khalaqahu | خ ل ق | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb + object pronoun (mansub) | Did He create him |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is an interrogative sentence with the prepositional phrase *min ayyi shayʾin* fronted before the verb *khalaqahu*. *Ayyi* is an interrogative noun in the genitive case (majrūr) after the preposition *min*, and it is the first part of an iḍāfah construction with *shayʾin* as the muḍāf ilayhi (also genitive). The verb *khalaqahu* has an implied subject (He/Allah) and the attached pronoun *-hu* as its object, referring back to *al-insān*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ayyi* is the construct form of the interrogative *ayyu* (which/what), taking genitive case after the preposition. *Shayʾin* is from root ش-ي-ء, a basic masculine noun meaning "thing" or "substance." *Khalaqahu* is Form I past tense from root خ-ل-ق, the fundamental verb for divine creation in Arabic.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical question is not seeking information but provoking reflection. By asking "from what thing did He create him?" — immediately after declaring human ingratitude — the Quran forces the listener to confront the humility of human origins before the answer is given in the next verse. The question format engages the listener actively, making them anticipate the answer rather than passively receiving it. The vague *shayʾ* (thing/substance) builds suspense for the specific *nuṭfah* (sperm-drop) that follows.

### Verse 19


<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِن نُّطْفَةٍ خَلَقَهُۥ فَقَدَّرَهُۥ"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase *min nuṭfatin* is fronted before the verb *khalaqahu*, answering the question from verse 18. The verb *khalaqahu* has an implied divine subject and the pronoun *-hu* as its object. The *fa-* then introduces a sequential result: *qaddarahu*, with the same subject-object structure. This is a compound sentence with two verbal clauses joined by *fa-* (sequential connective).

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Nuṭfah* is a Form I noun from root ن-ط-ف on the *fuʿlah* pattern, meaning a drop or small amount of liquid. *Khalaqahu* repeats from verse 18 (Form I, root خ-ل-ق). *Qaddarahu* is a Form II verb from root ق-د-ر on the *faʿʿala* pattern — the doubling of the middle radical creates an intensive/causative meaning: to measure precisely, determine, proportion, decree. The Form II here conveys deliberate, careful divine action.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The answer to verse 18's question is devastatingly humble: *min nuṭfatin* — from a mere drop. The contrast between human arrogance (*mā akfarahu*) and human origin (*nuṭfah*) is the rhetorical core of this passage. The sequential *fa-* between *khalaqahu* and *qaddarahu* is significant: creation and divine decree are presented as a seamless, purposeful process — God did not merely create but proportioned and measured, implying that every aspect of human existence is by divine design, leaving no room for the self-sufficiency claimed in verse 5.

### Verse 20

| 3 | يَسَّرَهُۥ | yassarahu | ي س ر | Verb - Form II, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb + object pronoun (mansub) | He facilitated it |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Thumma* (then, thereafter) introduces a later stage in the sequence, distinct from the immediate *fa-* of verse 19. The object *al-sabīla* is fronted (taqdīm) before the verb *yassarahu* for emphasis — the standard order would be *yassara l-sabīla*, but fronting the object highlights the path itself. *Al-sabīla* is accusative (manṣūb) as the direct object (mafʿūl bihi), and the pronoun *-hu* in *yassarahu* refers back to *al-sabīl* or *al-insān* depending on the reading.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yassara* is a Form II past tense verb from root ي-س-ر, on the *faʿʿala* pattern. The doubling of the middle radical creates a causative/intensive meaning: to make easy, facilitate, smooth. *Al-sabīl* is from root س-ب-ل, a *faʿīl* pattern noun meaning road, path, or way. It can be treated as either masculine or feminine in Arabic.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The fronting of *al-sabīla* before the verb is a deliberate rhetorical choice (taqdīm al-mafʿūl) that focuses attention on the "path" itself. The word *al-sabīl* carries rich polysemy: it can mean the birth canal (physical path from womb to world), the path of life (guidance through existence), or the way of righteousness. This deliberate ambiguity is a hallmark of Quranic rhetoric — the verse simultaneously describes physical birth and spiritual guidance in a single image. The shift from *fa-* (verse 19) to *thumma* marks a distinct new phase in the human journey.

### Verse 21

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Thumma* introduces the next stage in the life cycle sequence, indicating a later temporal step. The two verbs *amātahu* and *aqbarahu* are joined by *fa-* (immediate sequence), indicating that burial follows directly after death. Both have the same syntactic structure: verb + implied divine subject + object pronoun *-hu*. The *thumma...fa-* pairing in this verse distinguishes two types of sequence: *thumma* marks a gap from the previous stage, *fa-* marks immediacy between death and burial.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Both verbs are Form IV (*afʿala* pattern). *Amāta* derives from root م-و-ت: the Form IV creates a causative meaning — to cause to die — from the intransitive Form I *māta* (to die). The weak middle radical *wāw* appears as alif in Form IV. *Aqbara* derives from root ق-ب-ر: to place in a grave, from the noun *qabr* (grave). Form IV here is denominative — deriving a verb from a noun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The life cycle sequence (creation from a drop, path made easy, death, burial, resurrection) compresses an entire human existence into five verses. The use of Form IV causatives throughout emphasizes divine agency at every stage — God *causes* death, God *provides* the grave. Even the dignity of burial is presented as a divine gift, not a human right. The *fa-* between death and burial creates a sense of care and immediacy: God does not leave the human unattended after death but provides for burial immediately.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Thumma* introduces the final stage, and *idhā* introduces a temporal conditional clause. The protasis (condition) is *shāʾa* and the apodosis (result) is *ansharahu*. Both verbs are in the past tense despite referring to future events — this is standard Arabic for *idhā* conditionals, where past tense conveys certainty about future occurrences. The implied subject of both verbs is Allah.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Shāʾa* is a Form I hollow verb from root ش-ي-ء. *Ansharahu* is Form IV from root ن-ش-ر: the basic meaning of *nashara* is to spread out or unfold, and the Form IV *anshara* means to bring back to life, resurrect — literally, to cause to spread out (from the earth). This connects death (folding into the earth) with resurrection (unfolding from it).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The conditional *idhā shāʾa* (when He wills) is rhetorically significant: it places resurrection entirely within divine will, not as an automatic process. The use of *thumma* (then, later) before this verse — after the immediacy of death and burial — creates a temporal gap that mirrors the actual period between death and resurrection. The choice of *anshara* (to spread out, resurrect) connects back to *aqbara* (to bury): what was placed in the earth will be spread out from it. The sequence is now complete: drop, creation, path, death, grave, resurrection — a full arc of existence in six verses.

### Verse 23

  arabic="كَلَّا لَمَّا يَقْضِ مَآ أَمَرَهُۥ"

| 5 | أَمَرَهُۥ | amarahu | ا م ر | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Verb + object pronoun | He commanded him |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Kallā* is the emphatic rebuke particle, creating a transition. *Lammā* is a negative particle meaning "not yet" that governs the jussive mood (jazm) — the verb *yaqḍi* appears in the jussive with the final *yāʾ* dropped (the full indicative form would be *yaqḍī*). *Mā* functions as a relative pronoun meaning "what/that which," serving as the object of *yaqḍi*. The clause *amarahu* is the predicate of the relative *mā*, with *-hu* as the object pronoun referring to *al-insān*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yaqḍi* is a Form I present tense from the defective root ق-ض-ي. In the jussive mood after *lammā*, the weak final radical *yāʾ* is deleted, leaving *yaqḍi* rather than *yaqḍī*. This deletion (ḥadhf ḥarf al-ʿillah) is the standard jussive marker for defective verbs. *Amarahu* is Form I from root ا-م-ر (to command), with the attached object pronoun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The second *kallā* in the surah creates a structural marker, closing the creation sequence and returning to the theme of human failure. The particle *lammā* (not yet) is more powerful than simple *lam* (not): it implies that the action was expected but has not materialized up to the present moment — man was *supposed* to fulfill divine commands but *still* has not. This creates a sense of ongoing, inexcusable delinquency rather than mere absence. The vague *mā amarahu* (what He commanded him) leaves the scope of unfulfilled obligations deliberately broad.

### Verse 24


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَلْيَنظُرِ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنُ إِلَىٰ طَعَامِهِۦٓ"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The combination *fa-li-yanẓur* creates a third-person jussive command: *fa-* is the connective, *li-* is the lām al-amr (particle of command) that governs the jussive mood, and *yanẓuri* is in the jussive (majzūm). *Al-insānu* is the fāʿil (subject, marfūʿ). The prepositional phrase *ilā ṭaʿāmihi* specifies the object of contemplation. The possessive pronoun *-hi* in *ṭaʿāmihi* refers back to *al-insān*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yanẓuri* is Form I present tense from root ن-ظ-ر (to look, contemplate). In the jussive mood, the final *ḍammah* of the indicative (*yanẓuru*) changes to *sukūn*, but a kasrah appears for phonetic ease before the following lām of *al-insān*. *Ṭaʿām* is a verbal noun from root ط-ع-م on the *faʿāl* pattern, meaning food or sustenance.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The jussive command *fa-l-yanẓur* shifts the discourse from abstract theological argument to concrete, sensory experience: "let man look at his food." This is a masterful rhetorical pivot — after discussing creation, death, and resurrection in abstract terms, the Quran grounds the argument in the most everyday, tangible reality: food. The choice of food (rather than, say, the sun or mountains) is deliberate: it is something every person encounters daily, making the argument inescapable. This verse opens a passage (24-32) that traces the entire agricultural process as evidence of divine care.

### Verse 25


<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَنَّا صَبَبْنَا ٱلْمَآءَ صَبًّۭا"
  transliteration="annā ṣababnā l-māʾa ṣabban"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Annā* is the particle *anna* (that/how) combined with the first person plural pronoun *nā*, forming the ism of *anna* (accusative). The clause *ṣababnā l-māʾa ṣabban* is the khabar of *anna*. *Al-māʾa* is the direct object (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb) of *ṣababnā*, and *ṣabban* is the mafʿūl muṭlaq (absolute/cognate accusative), also manṣūb, reinforcing the manner and intensity of the pouring.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ṣababnā* is Form I past tense from the doubled root ص-ب-ب (to pour). In the first person plural conjugation, the doubled second and third radicals appear separately (*ṣa-bab-nā*). *Ṣabban* is the verbal noun (maṣdar) of the same root, also showing the doubled radical. *Al-māʾ* derives from root م-و-ء, a hollow noun meaning water.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift to the divine "We" (*nā*) is rhetorically striking — after discussing man in the third person, Allah now speaks in the first person plural of majesty, asserting direct agency over natural processes. The mafʿūl muṭlaq *ṣabban* (a pouring) intensifies the image: it is not merely water descending but water poured deliberately and abundantly. This begins a descending chain of divine actions — from sky (water) to earth (splitting) to growth (crops) — mirroring the actual process of agriculture and subtly arguing that every meal is a divine gift.

### Verse 26


<ArabicExample
  arabic="ثُمَّ شَقَقْنَا ٱلْأَرْضَ شَقًّۭا"
  transliteration="thumma shaqaqnā l-arḍa shaqqan"
  translation="Then We broke open the earth, splitting [it]"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse mirrors verse 25 in structure: *thumma* (sequence) + verb + direct object + mafʿūl muṭlaq. *Al-arḍa* is the direct object (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb), and *shaqqan* is the mafʿūl muṭlaq (absolute object, manṣūb), reinforcing the verb. The *thumma* indicates that the splitting of the earth follows the pouring of water — a sequential description of the germination process.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Shaqaqnā* is Form I past tense from the doubled root ش-ق-ق (to split, cleave). Like *ṣababnā*, the doubled radicals appear separately in the first person plural conjugation. *Shaqqan* is the verbal noun (maṣdar) from the same root. The pattern of doubled-root verbs (ṣ-b-b, sh-q-q) in consecutive verses creates phonetic similarity.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The parallel structure between verses 25 and 26 — both ending with a mafʿūl muṭlaq from the same root as their verb — creates a rhythmic, incantatory quality that emphasizes the deliberateness of divine action. The image of earth being "split open" (*shaqqan*) is vivid and dynamic: the earth is not passive but responds to the water by breaking apart for seeds. The progression from water pouring down to earth splitting upward creates a spatial image of convergence — heaven and earth collaborating in sustenance.

### Verse 27


<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَنۢبَتْنَا فِيهَا حَبًّۭا"

| 4 | حَبًّۭا | ḥabban | ح ب ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Object (mafʿūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb) | Grain |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Fa-* introduces the result of the splitting: growth. *Anbatnā* is the verb with an implied "We" subject, *fīhā* is a prepositional phrase meaning "in it" (referring to *al-arḍ*), and *ḥabban* is the direct object (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb). This verse establishes the governing verb for a long enumeration of crops that continues through verse 31 — all subsequent accusative nouns (*ʿinaban*, *qaḍban*, *zaytūnan*, etc.) are coordinate objects of this single *anbatnā*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Anbatnā* is Form IV past tense from root ن-ب-ت (to grow). The Form IV *afʿala* pattern creates a causative: to cause to grow, to produce vegetation. The *tāʾ* in *anbatnā* is the feminine marker of the original verb *anbata*, which combines with *nā* (we). *Ḥabban* is from the doubled root ح-ب-ب on the *faʿl* pattern, a collective noun meaning grain or seeds.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The transition from *thumma shaqaqnā* (splitting) to *fa-anbatnā* (growing) uses *fa-* to show immediate causation: the splitting leads directly to growth. The choice to begin the crop list with *ḥabban* (grain) — the most fundamental food staple — then proceed to increasingly luxurious items (grapes, olives, gardens, fruit) creates an ascending catalogue of blessings. The single governing verb *anbatnā* spanning five verses demonstrates how a single divine act produces an abundance of provision.

### Verse 28

  arabic="وَعِنَبًۭا وَقَضْبًۭا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *ʿinaban* and *qaḍban* are coordinate direct objects (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb) of *anbatnā* from verse 27, joined by the conjunction *wa-*. All items in this enumeration maintain accusative case (manṣūb with fatḥah tanwīn) as objects of the governing verb. No new verb is introduced — the syntactic scope of *anbatnā* extends across multiple verses.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *ʿInab* is from root ع-ن-ب on the *fiʿal* pattern, a collective noun meaning grapes or grapevines. *Qaḍb* is from root ق-ض-ب on the *faʿl* pattern, meaning fresh herbage, fodder, or plants that are cut for animal feed. Both are simple Form I nouns with tanwīn indicating indefiniteness.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The pairing of *ʿinab* (grapes, a human luxury food) with *qaḍb* (herbage, animal fodder) is deliberate: the provision encompasses both human enjoyment and animal sustenance, foreshadowing verse 32's explicit statement that these blessings are "for you and your livestock." The compact two-item verse, joined only by *wa-*, creates a rhythmic cadence that propels the enumeration forward with momentum.

### Verse 29


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَزَيْتُونًۭا وَنَخْلًۭا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *zaytūnan* and *nakhlan* continue as coordinate direct objects (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb) of *anbatnā* from verse 27, joined by *wa-*. The accusative case with fatḥah tanwīn is maintained throughout the entire enumeration. The syntactic reach of the original verb across five verses is a notable feature of Quranic Arabic.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Zaytūn* is from root ز-ي-ت on the *fayʿūl* pattern, a collective noun for olives or olive trees. The root also gives *zayt* (oil), indicating the close association between the tree and its product. *Nakhl* is from root ن-خ-ل on the *faʿl* pattern, a collective noun for date palms. Both are non-Arabic loanword-patterned or archaic forms.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The olives and date palms represent two of the most culturally and economically important crops in the Arabian and Mediterranean worlds. Their pairing reflects both the immediate Arab context (date palms) and the broader Semitic agricultural tradition (olives). The list progresses from basic sustenance (grain) through luxury food (grapes) and fodder (herbage) to culturally symbolic trees, building a comprehensive picture of divine provision that spans every category of agricultural blessing.

### Verse 30

  arabic="وَحَدَآئِقَ غُلْبًۭا"
  transliteration="wa-ḥadāʾiqa ghulban"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Ḥadāʾiqa* continues as a coordinate object (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb) of *anbatnā*. The adjective *ghulban* agrees with *ḥadāʾiq* in case (accusative, manṣūb) and definiteness (both indefinite). Note that *ḥadāʾiqa* is a diptote (mamnūʿ min al-ṣarf) — it takes fatḥah instead of tanwīn in the accusative and kasrah instead of tanwīn in the genitive, following the broken plural pattern *faʿāʾil*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ḥadāʾiq* is the broken plural of *ḥadīqah* (garden, enclosed garden) from root ح-د-ق, on the *faʿāʾil* pattern typical of feminine singular nouns of the *faʿīlah* type. *Ghulb* is the plural of *ghalabāʾ* or *aghlabū* from root غ-ل-ب, meaning thick-necked, dense, or luxuriant — here describing the thick, lush vegetation of the gardens.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The move from individual crops (grain, grapes, olives) to *ḥadāʾiq* (gardens) elevates the description from items to landscapes — the scope widens from what grows to where it grows. The adjective *ghulb* (dense, thick) paints an image of overwhelming abundance and lushness, conveying that divine provision is not minimal but extravagant. The gardens represent the pinnacle of agricultural beauty, transitioning from necessity (grain) to luxury (gardens).

### Verse 31

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *fākihatan* and *abban* are the final coordinate direct objects (mafʿūl bihi, manṣūb) of *anbatnā* from verse 27, concluding the seven-item enumeration. The conjunction *wa-* links them. All seven items (ḥabb, ʿinab, qaḍb, zaytūn, nakhl, ḥadāʾiq, fākihah, abb) are accusative, governed by the single verb *anbatnā* five verses earlier.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Fākihah* is from root ف-ك-ه on the *fāʿilah* pattern, functioning as a noun meaning fruit (general term for all types of fruit). *Abb* is from root ا-ب-ب on the *faʿl* pattern, meaning grass, herbage, or pasture — specifically vegetation suitable for grazing animals. This is a relatively rare Quranic word; even ʿUmar ibn al-Khaṭṭāb reportedly noted its uncommon usage.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The pairing of *fākihah* (fruit, for human enjoyment) and *abb* (pasture, for animals) mirrors the pairing of *ʿinab* (human food) and *qaḍb* (animal fodder) in verse 28, creating a ring structure within the crop enumeration. This deliberate alternation between human and animal provisions prepares for verse 32's explicit dual address. The word *abb* is notable for being one of the Quran's rarest vocabulary items, adding a sense of comprehensiveness — even the least-known forms of vegetation are catalogued as divine blessings.

### Verse 32

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Matāʿan* is in the accusative (manṣūb) functioning as a ḥāl (circumstantial accusative) or mafʿūl li-ajlihi (accusative of purpose), indicating the purpose of all the provisions listed. *Lakum* is a prepositional phrase (preposition *li-* + second person plural pronoun) specifying the human beneficiaries. *Wa-li-anʿāmikum* is a coordinate prepositional phrase specifying the animal beneficiaries. *Anʿāmikum* is genitive (majrūr) after *li-*, with the possessive pronoun *-kum* attached.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Matāʿ* is a verbal noun from root م-ت-ع on the *mafāʿ* pattern, meaning provision, enjoyment, or benefit. *Anʿām* is the broken plural of *naʿam* (grazing animals, livestock) from root ن-ع-م, on the *afʿāl* pattern. The root ن-ع-م also gives *niʿmah* (blessing) — a connection that reinforces the thematic link between livestock and divine bounty.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse serves as the summary and conclusion of the entire agricultural passage (verses 24-32). The shift to second person plural address (*lakum*, *anʿāmikum*) is significant — the entire preceding passage used third person (*al-insān*) or first person divine (*anbatnā*), but now Allah speaks directly to the audience: "for *you*." This direct address makes the argument personal and inescapable. The inclusion of livestock alongside humans in receiving divine provision demonstrates that God's care extends beyond humanity to all creation.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Fa-* introduces a dramatic transition, and *idhā* establishes a temporal conditional clause: "when X happens, [then Y]." The verb *jāʾati* is past tense feminine (with the *tāʾ al-taʾnīth*) to agree with the feminine subject *al-ṣākhkhatu*. The subject is placed after the verb in standard Arabic verbal sentence order. The jawāb (apodosis) of this *idhā* condition extends through the following verses — the consequences unfold over verses 34-42.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Jāʾati* is Form I past tense from the hollow root ج-ي-ء, with the feminine suffix *-ti* (rather than *-ta*) before the definite article of the subject. *Al-ṣākhkhah* derives from root ص-خ-خ on the *fāʿʿilah* pattern (with doubled second radical), meaning a deafening, ear-splitting cry or blast. The *tāʾ marbūṭah* ending makes it feminine, and the doubling of the *khāʾ* intensifies the meaning.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The *fa-* at the beginning of this verse creates a jarring transition from the lush agricultural scene of verses 24-32 to the terror of Judgment Day. This juxtaposition is deliberate: the blessings of food and nature are immediately followed by their eschatological counterpart — the day when all such provisions cease to matter. The word *al-ṣākhkhah* is a hapax legomenon in the Quran (appearing only here), which adds to its startling impact. Its phonetic quality — the heavy, emphatic *ṣād* followed by the doubled *khāʾ* — mimics the harshness of the sound it describes.

### Verse 34

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | يَوْمَ | yawma | ي و م | Noun - masculine singular (adverb of time) | Adverbial accusative (ẓarf zamān) - accusative (manṣūb) | Day/on the day |

| 5 | أَخِيهِ | akhīhi | ا خ و | Noun - masculine singular + possessive pronoun | Genitive (majrūr) after preposition | His brother |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Yawma* functions as a ẓarf zamān (adverb of time) in the accusative (manṣūb), specifying when the fleeing occurs. The verb *yafirru* is present tense indicative (marfūʿ), used here in a future context. *Al-marʾu* is the fāʿil (subject, marfūʿ). The prepositional phrase *min akhīhi* specifies the source from which one flees, with *akhīhi* genitive after *min* and carrying a possessive pronoun. This *min* + noun pattern extends across three verses (34-36).

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Yafirru* is Form I present tense from the doubled root ف-ر-ر, on the *yafʿillu* pattern. The doubled final radical appears as a shaddah in the present tense. *Al-marʾu* from root م-ر-ء is an irregular noun meaning "person" or "man." *Akhīhi* is from the five exceptional nouns (*al-asmāʾ al-khamsah*) — root ا-خ-و — which take long vowels instead of short vowels for case marking: *akhū* (nominative), *akhā* (accusative), *akhī* (genitive, as here).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The choice to begin with "his brother" — rather than parents or spouse — is deliberate. The brother is the first person one would typically turn to in crisis; beginning with this relationship and then moving to even closer bonds (parents, spouse, children) creates an escalating sense of horror. The present tense *yafirru* in a future context creates immediacy, as if the listener is witnessing the scene unfold in real time.

### Verse 35


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأُمِّهِۦ وَأَبِيهِ"
  transliteration="wa-ummihi wa-abīhi"
  translation="And his mother and his father"

| 4 | أَبِيهِ | abīhi | ا ب و | Noun - masculine singular + possessive pronoun | Genitive (majrūr), coordinate with *akhīhi* | His father |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *ummihi* and *abīhi* are coordinate genitives (majrūr) joined by *wa-*, still governed by the preposition *min* from verse 34. The syntactic scope of *min* extends across three verses (34-36), governing all five relatives. This long-distance prepositional government mirrors the extended scope of *anbatnā* in the agricultural passage.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ummihi* is from root ا-م-م, a feminine noun with the possessive pronoun *-hi*. It takes kasrah in the genitive. *Abīhi* is another of the five exceptional nouns (*al-asmāʾ al-khamsah*, root ا-ب-و) — in the genitive case, the long *ī* replaces the standard kasrah marker: *abū* (nominative), *abā* (accusative), *abī* (genitive). The possessive pronoun *-hi* attaches to the genitive form.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The move from brother (verse 34) to mother and father (verse 35) intensifies the emotional impact. Parents represent the deepest bonds of love and obligation in human culture — fleeing from one's own mother is presented as the ultimate sign of terror. The order — mother before father — may reflect the deeper emotional bond typically associated with the mother, making her mention first more shocking. The two-word verse structure (*wa-ummihi wa-abīhi*) creates a breathless, list-like rhythm that conveys the panic of the scene.

### Verse 36


<ArabicExample

| 4 | بَنِيهِ | banīhi | ب ن ي | Noun - masculine plural + possessive pronoun | Genitive (majrūr), coordinate | His children |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** *Ṣāḥibatihi* and *banīhi* are the final coordinate genitives after *min* from verse 34, completing the five-member list. Both are genitive (majrūr) with possessive pronouns. *Banīhi* is in the construct state (iḍāfah) with the pronoun, causing the sound masculine plural ending *-ūna/-īna* to lose its nūn: *banīna* becomes *banī-hi*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ṣāḥibatihi* is the feminine form of *ṣāḥib* (companion) from root ص-ح-ب, with the *tāʾ marbūṭah* indicating feminine gender. In the genitive with a pronoun, the *tāʾ marbūṭah* appears as *-ti-*: *ṣāḥibati-hi*. *Banīhi* is the irregular sound masculine plural of *ibn* (son) from root ب-ن-ي — *ibn* becomes *banūna* (nominative) or *banīna* (accusative/genitive), and the nūn drops in construct state to yield *banī-*.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The climax of the fleeing list is wife (*ṣāḥibah*) and children (*banī*) — the immediate family, the innermost circle of human attachment. The choice of *ṣāḥibah* (companion) rather than *zawjah* (wife) is significant: *ṣāḥibah* emphasizes the bond of companionship and lifelong partnership, making the abandonment even more striking. Children are placed last for maximum emotional effect — fleeing from one's own children represents the absolute dissolution of every human bond. The five-member list (brother, mother, father, wife, children) mirrors the entirety of family structure.

| 7 | يُغْنِيهِ | yughnīhi | غ ن ي | Verb - Form IV, present, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Relative clause verb + object pronoun | Occupies him/suffices him |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase *li-kulli mriʾin* is fronted as the predicate (khabar muqaddam), with *shaʾnun* as the delayed subject (mubtadaʾ muʾakhkhar). This inversion places emphasis on the universality ("for every person") rather than on the matter itself. *Minhum* is an adjectival prepositional phrase describing *imriʾin*. *Yawmaʾidhin* is a compound adverb of time (ẓarf zamān). The clause *yughnīhi* is a relative clause (ṣifah) modifying *shaʾnun*, with the implied relative pronoun.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Kulli* is the genitive form of *kull* (every/all). *Imriʾin* is the genitive of *imruʾ* (person), from the irregular root م-ر-ء. *Yawmaʾidhin* is a compound of *yawm* (day) + *idh* (when, referring to a past/known time) + tanwīn al-ʿiwaḍ (compensatory tanwīn replacing the deleted clause). *Yughnīhi* is Form IV present tense from root غ-ن-ي, meaning to suffice, occupy fully, or make needless of others.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse provides the devastating explanation for the fleeing described in verses 34-36: it is not hatred but overwhelming self-concern. The phrase *shaʾnun yughnīhi* (a matter that fully occupies him) is understated yet terrifying — each person is so consumed by their own reckoning that even the deepest bonds of love become irrelevant. The word *yughnī* (Form IV, to make self-sufficient) ironically echoes *istaghná* (Form X, considered himself self-sufficient) from verse 5 — the self-sufficiency that was delusion in this world becomes forced reality on Judgment Day.

### Verse 38


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وُجُوهٌۭ يَوْمَئِذٍۢ مُّسْفِرَةٌۭ"
  transliteration="wujūhun yawmaʾidhin musfiratun"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence: *wujūhun* is the mubtadaʾ (subject, marfūʿ with ḍammah tanwīn) and *musfiratun* is the khabar (predicate, marfūʿ with ḍammah tanwīn). The adverb *yawmaʾidhin* is inserted between subject and predicate as a temporal modifier. The indefiniteness of *wujūhun* (some faces, not all) indicates partition — only some faces will have this quality.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Wujūh* is the broken plural of *wajh* (face) from root و-ج-ه. *Musfirah* is the feminine form of the Form IV active participle *musfir* from root س-ف-ر, on the *mufʿilah* pattern. The Form IV meaning here is intransitive: to shine, be bright, be radiant. The feminine form agrees with *wujūh*, which is treated as a feminine plural (non-human plurals in Arabic take feminine singular agreement, but *wujūh* can also take feminine plural).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift to describing faces creates a powerful visual tableau — after the abstract terror of fleeing and self-concern, the Quran now paints concrete portraits. The contrast structure (bright faces in 38-39 versus dusty faces in 40-42) is a classic Quranic rhetorical device: presenting paired opposites to force the listener to identify with one group. Beginning with the positive image (bright faces) before the negative creates a pattern of hope before warning.

### Verse 39


<ArabicExample

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both *ḍāḥikatun* and *mustabshiratun* are additional predicates (akhbār mutaʿaddidah) for the subject *wujūhun* from verse 38. All three predicates (*musfiratun*, *ḍāḥikatun*, *mustabshiratun*) are nominative (marfūʿ with ḍammah tanwīn), agreeing with the subject in case. This stacking of multiple predicates for a single subject is a feature of Arabic that allows rich, multi-layered description.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ḍāḥikah* is the feminine form of the Form I active participle *ḍāḥik* from root ض-ح-ك, on the *fāʿilah* pattern — laughing. *Mustabshirah* is the feminine form of the Form X active participle *mustabshir* from root ب-ش-ر, on the *mustafʿilah* pattern — seeking/receiving good news, rejoicing. The progression from Form I through Form IV to Form X in three consecutive participles (ḍāḥikah I, musfirah IV, mustabshirah X) showcases the richness of Arabic's derived verb system.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The three participles create an ascending emotional trajectory: brightness (physical state), laughter (emotional expression), and rejoicing at good news (spiritual state of receiving divine acceptance). Each layer deepens the description from outer appearance to inner experience. The Form X *mustabshirah* is particularly significant: it implies not just joy but the active reception of good tidings (*bushrā*), suggesting that the blessed are receiving their final judgment of paradise at this very moment.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence with a complex predicate structure. *Wujūhun* is the mubtadaʾ (subject, marfūʿ). The khabar (predicate) is the prepositional phrase *ʿalayhā ghabaratun*, where *ʿalayhā* (upon them) relates to *ghabaratun* (dust). This is a *jumlah ẓarfiyyah* (locative sentence) serving as the predicate — "upon them [is] dust." The adverb *yawmaʾidhin* is again inserted as a temporal modifier.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ghabarah* is from root غ-ب-ر on the *faʿalah* pattern, meaning dust, gloom, or ashen pallor. It is a *ism maṣdar* (verbal noun variant) that describes both the physical appearance (dusty) and the emotional state (gloomy). The pronoun *-hā* in *ʿalayhā* refers back to *wujūh* (feminine reference for non-human plural).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The contrast with verse 38 is stark and deliberate: where the blessed faces were *musfirah* (bright), the wretched faces are covered in *ghabarah* (dust). The structural parallelism (*wujūhun yawmaʾidhin* + predicate) between verses 38 and 40 forces the listener to compare the two scenes. However, the predicate structure differs: verse 38 uses a simple adjective (*musfiratun*), while verse 40 uses a prepositional phrase (*ʿalayhā ghabaratun*), suggesting that the dust is not an inherent quality but something imposed upon them from outside — a covering of shame and distress.

### Verse 41

| 2 | قَتَرَةٌۭ | qataratun | ق ت ر | Noun - feminine singular, indefinite | Subject (fāʿil) - nominative (marfūʿ) | Darkness/gloom |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence where the subject *qataratun* (fāʿil, marfūʿ) follows the verb *tarhaquhā*. The verb takes a feminine prefix *ta-* to agree with the feminine subject. The attached pronoun *-hā* functions as the object (manṣūb), referring back to *wujūh* from verse 40. The verb-subject-object order (VSO) is the standard Arabic verbal sentence structure.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Tarhaquhā* is Form I present tense from root ر-ه-ق, meaning to cover, overwhelm, or engulf. The *ta-* prefix indicates feminine third person. *Qatarah* is from root ق-ت-ر on the *faʿalah* pattern, meaning darkness, black smoke, or deep gloom. Both *ghabarah* (verse 40) and *qatarah* (verse 41) share the *faʿalah* pattern, creating phonetic resonance.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the static description of dust (*ghabarah*) resting upon the faces, this verse adds a dynamic layer: darkness actively *overwhelms* them. The verb *tarhaquhā* (covers/engulfs) personifies *qatarah* (darkness) as an aggressive force, not merely a passive state. The progression from *ghabarah* (dust, suggesting shame and degradation) to *qatarah* (darkness, suggesting despair and spiritual blindness) creates an escalation of punishment imagery. The two-word verse creates a sense of finality and suffocation.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis (Verse 42)

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence with the demonstrative pronoun *ulāʾika* as the mubtadaʾ (subject, marfūʿ). The detached pronoun *humu* functions as *ḍamīr al-faṣl* (pronoun of separation) — it separates the subject from the predicate to add emphasis and prevent the predicate from being read as an adjective. *Al-kafaratu* is the khabar (predicate, marfūʿ), and *al-fajaratu* is a second coordinate predicate. Both are definite nouns, creating an equation sentence.

**Sarf (Morphology):** *Ulāʾika* is the demonstrative pronoun for distant plural referents (those), built on a unique morphological pattern not derived from a triliteral root. *Al-kafarah* is the plural of *kāfir* (disbeliever) from root ك-ف-ر on the *faʿalah* pattern, a common broken plural for *fāʿil*-pattern active participles. *Al-fajarah* is the plural of *fājir* (wicked, sinful) from root ف-ج-ر on the same *faʿalah* pattern. The morphological parallelism between the two predicates creates a phonetic pairing.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The final verse serves as a conclusive identification (*taʿyīn*) — naming the owners of the wretched faces. The *ḍamīr al-faṣl* (*humu*) adds emphatic restriction: "those — they [and no one else] — are the disbelievers." The double predicate *al-kafarah al-fajarah* combines theological and moral categories: *kufr* (disbelief) as an internal state and *fujūr* (wickedness) as its external manifestation. The phonetic similarity between *kafarah* and *fajarah* creates a memorable, almost incantatory conclusion. This verse closes the surah with absolute clarity, in stark contrast to the ambiguity of its opening (where even the subject of *ʿabasa* was initially unnamed).


#### Surah-Level Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Surah ʿAbasa demonstrates a remarkable range of syntactic structures within 42 verses. The opening two verses use verbal sentences in the third person, then verses 3-10 alternate between interrogative constructions (*mā yudrīka*, *mā ʿalayka*) and *ammā...fa-* conditional topic markers. Verses 11-16 employ *inna* nominal sentences and stacked adjective chains in genitive agreement. The creation passage (17-22) features a sequential *thumma/fa-* chain with Form IV causative verbs, while the agricultural section (24-32) showcases a single governing verb (*anbatnā*) whose syntactic scope extends across five verses of coordinate accusative objects. The eschatological section (33-42) opens with an *idhā* conditional whose apodosis spans nine verses, and closes with nominal sentences using multiple predicates and the *ḍamīr al-faṣl*.

**Sarf (Morphology):** The surah is a showcase of Arabic verb form diversity. Form V reflexive verbs dominate the moral section (*tawallā*, *yazzakkā*, *tasaddā*, *talahhā*, *yadhdhakkaru*), reflecting the inward-turning nature of spiritual actions. Form IV causatives govern the creation section (*amāta*, *aqbara*, *anshara*, *anbatnā*, *yudrīka*, *yughnī*), emphasizing divine agency. The agricultural passage features Form I doubled-root verbs (*ṣababnā*, *shaqaqnā*) with their cognate *mafʿūl muṭlaq* forms. Active participles from multiple forms (I, IV, X) create the eschatological portraits. Notable morphological features include weak final radical verbs (alif maqṣūrah endings throughout), the five exceptional nouns (*akhīhi*, *abīhi*), jussive mood after *lammā* and *li-* amr, and assimilation (*idghām*) in *yazzakkā* and *yadhdhakkaru*.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah's rhetorical architecture moves through five distinct registers: indirect narrative (1-2), direct reproach (3-10), declarative assertion (11-16), argumentative reflection (17-32), and eschatological warning (33-42). Key rhetorical devices include the person shift (*iltifāt*) from third to second person, the *ammā...fa-* contrast structure creating parallel condemnation, the exclamatory *mā afʿalahu* pattern for emotional intensity, the *mafʿūl muṭlaq* for emphasis in the agricultural passage, and the face-contrast tableau in the finale. The surah's ring composition is notable: it opens with a human frowning (*ʿabasa*) and closes with faces covered in dust and darkness — the Prophet's momentary frown becomes an eternal state for the disbelievers, transforming a micro-incident into a macro-moral lesson.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="In verse 2 (أَن جَآءَهُ ٱلْأَعْمَىٰ), identify the grammatical function of أَنْ and explain why the verb جَاءَ takes a fatḥa despite being preceded by أَنْ.">

Here أَنْ is a maṣdariyya particle that turns the clause into a verbal noun (maṣdar mu'awwal). The verb جَاءَهُ appears with fatḥa because it is māḍī (past tense) — أَنْ only causes naṣb on muḍāriʿ verbs. The entire أَن جَاءَهُ الأَعْمَى functions as the maṣdar mu'awwal serving as the mafʿūl lahu (adverbial of reason) for عَبَسَ.

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the word كَلَّا in verse 11 (كَلَّآ إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ). What is its grammatical function, and how does the إِنَّ clause that follows reinforce its meaning?">

كَلَّا is a ḥarf radʿ wa zajr (particle of deterrence and rebuke) — it negates and rebukes the preceding behavior. It has no iʿrāb (it is mabnī). The إِنَّ clause (إِنَّهَا تَذْكِرَةٌ) provides the taʿlīl (justification): the pronoun هَا refers to the Qur'anic message, إِنَّ emphasizes the statement, and تَذْكِرَةٌ is the khabar (predicate) of إِنَّ, meaning 'a reminder.' Together, كَلَّا rebukes the neglect while إِنَّ asserts the inherent value of the revelation.
