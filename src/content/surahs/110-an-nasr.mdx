#### Grammar Notes
- إِذَا is a conditional particle for future events that are expected to occur.
- Although جَاءَ is past tense in form, when used after إِذَا it refers to a future event.
- نَصْرُ اللَّهِ forms an iḍāfah (possessive/genitive construction) meaning "the help of Allah."
- وَالْفَتْحُ is coordinated with نَصْرُ as a second subject of the verb جَاءَ.
- This verse is the conditional clause (protasis); the response comes in verse 2.
