<Callout type="tip" title="Unique Features of Surah Al-Buruj">
Al-Buruj is one of the most structurally powerful surahs in the Quran, featuring several remarkable grammatical and rhetorical features:

- **Three-fold oath structure** (verses 1-3): The sky with its constellations, the Promised Day, and the witness/witnessed -- building cosmic suspense before the devastating jawab al-qasam
- **The People of the Trench narrative** (verses 4-9): A harrowing historical account told through passive voice (qutila), badal explanations, and circumstantial clauses, all compressed into just six verses
- **The inna emphasis chain** (verses 10-13): Four consecutive sentences opening with inna -- punishment, reward, divine severity, divine power -- creating a thundering rhetorical crescendo
- **The paradox of severity and mercy** (verses 12-14): Immediately after declaring inna batsha rabbika la-shadid ("the seizure of your Lord is severe"), the surah introduces al-Ghafur al-Wadud ("the Forgiving, the Affectionate") -- one of the most striking juxtapositions of divine attributes in the entire Quran
- **Climax in the Preserved Tablet** (verse 22): The surah closes with the ultimate source -- fi lawhin mahfuz -- grounding everything in eternal divine knowledge and the inviolable preservation of the Quran

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالسَّمَاءِ ذَاتِ الْبُرُوجِ"
  transliteration="wa-s-samaa'i dhaati l-buruuj"
  translation="By the sky containing the constellations"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:1"
  highlight="الْبُرُوجِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | By |
| 2 | السَّمَاءِ | al-samaa'i | س م و | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | the sky |
| 3 | ذَاتِ | dhaat | - | Noun - feminine, singular, possessive | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | possessing/containing |
| 4 | الْبُرُوجِ | al-buruuj | ب ر ج | Noun - masculine, plural, definite | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) | the constellations |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Oath Constructions with wa al-Qasam">
- **wa al-qasam**: Oath particle -- Allah swears by His creation to draw attention to the momentous jawab (answer) that follows
- **dhat al-buruj**: Idafa construction -- "possessor of constellations," where dhat is a feminine possessive noun linking al-sama' to al-buruj
- **al-buruj**: Great stars/zodiac constellations -- magnificent celestial order that testifies to divine design
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse opens with wa al-qasam (oath particle), governing al-sama'i in the genitive case (majrur). The noun dhat functions as a na't (adjective) for al-sama', also taking kasra. Al-buruj is the mudaf ilayhi in the idafa chain dhat al-buruj, completing the genitive phrase.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-buruj is the plural of burj on the fu'ul pattern, indicating towers or great celestial structures. Al-sama' derives from the root س-م-و, a defective root where the final radical (waw) transforms in various forms.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** By swearing by the sky "possessing constellations," Allah directs attention to the vastness and order of the cosmos. The oath elevates the significance of what follows -- the condemnation is so grave that the entire heavens are invoked as witness. The choice of buruj (towers/constellations) rather than nujum (stars) emphasizes grandeur and fortification.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالْيَوْمِ الْمَوْعُودِ"
  transliteration="wa-l-yawmi l-maw'uud"
  translation="And by the Promised Day"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:2"
  highlight="الْمَوْعُودِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | And by |
| 2 | الْيَوْمِ | al-yawmi | ي و م | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | the Day |
| 3 | الْمَوْعُودِ | al-maw'uud | و ع د | Noun - passive participle, masculine, singular, definite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | the Promised |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Participle as Adjective">
- **al-yawm al-maw'ud**: The Day of Judgment -- the day that has been promised
- **maw'ud**: Passive participle (ism maf'ul) on the maf'ul pattern from root و-ع-د -- "that which is promised." The passive form indicates the Day is the object of a divine promise, not the agent
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Second oath in the chain, parallel to verse 1. Al-maw'ud is a na't (adjective) for al-yawm, both in the genitive (majrur) as objects of the oath particle wa.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-maw'ud follows the maf'ul passive participle pattern from the root و-ع-د. The initial waw of the root is absorbed into the maf'ul prefix ma-, producing maw'ud rather than the expected *maw'ud. This is a standard pattern for hollow roots beginning with waw.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The oath progression moves from the visible (sky with constellations) to the unseen (the Promised Day), building from what the eyes can witness to what faith affirms. The passive participle maw'ud implies a Promiser -- Allah Himself -- without naming Him, creating anticipation.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَشَاهِدٍ وَمَشْهُودٍ"
  transliteration="wa-shaahidin wa-mashhuud"
  translation="And by the witness and what is witnessed"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:3"
  highlight="شَاهِدٍ,مَشْهُودٍ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | And by |
| 2 | شَاهِدٍ | shaahidin | ش ه د | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | a witness |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | And by |
| 4 | مَشْهُودٍ | mashuud | ش ه د | Noun - passive participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | what is witnessed |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Active vs Passive Participle from the Same Root">
- **shahid vs mashhud**: Active vs passive participle from the same root ش-ه-د -- the one witnessing (fa'il pattern) vs what is witnessed (maf'ul pattern)
- Some interpret as: Friday (witness) and Day of 'Arafah (witnessed), or every witness and witnessed thing
- The indefiniteness of both words (tanwin kasra) universalizes the meaning -- not specific witnesses, but the concept of witnessing itself
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Third oath, completing the triad. Both shahid and mashhud are indefinite (marked by tanwin) and genitive (majrur) as objects of wa al-qasam. The wa between them is also an oath particle, creating a paired oath.

**Sarf (Morphology):** From root ش-ه-د: shahid follows the fa'il (active participle) pattern, while mashhud follows the maf'ul (passive participle) pattern. This is the clearest demonstration in the surah of how Arabic morphology creates antonymous pairs from a single root by shifting between active and passive patterns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The pairing of active and passive participles creates a comprehensive oath -- encompassing both the observer and the observed, the actor and the acted-upon. The indefiniteness amplifies the scope: every witness and everything witnessed across all time and space. This establishes a universal framework before the specific narrative of the People of the Trench.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُتِلَ أَصْحَابُ الْأُخْدُودِ"
  transliteration="qutila as-haabu l-ukhdud"
  translation="Cursed were the People of the Trench"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:4"
  highlight="قُتِلَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | قُتِلَ | qutila | ق ت ل | Verb - Form I, passive, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Passive verb (fi'l mabni lil-majhul) | was cursed/destroyed |
| 2 | أَصْحَابُ | as-haabu | ص ح ب | Noun - masculine, plural, construct state | Subject (na'ib al-fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | companions/people |
| 3 | الْأُخْدُودِ | al-ukhdud | خ د د | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) | the trench |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice for Imprecation (jawab al-qasam)">
- **qutila**: Passive form meaning "cursed/destroyed" -- this is an imprecation/condemnation (du'a'), not merely reporting a past event
- **as-hab al-ukhdud**: People who dug trenches to burn believers alive -- the na'ib al-fa'il (deputy subject) takes the nominative case
- This is the answer to the oath (jawab al-qasam) -- after three cosmic oaths, the condemnation arrives with devastating force
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is the jawab al-qasam (answer to the oath) that the three preceding verses built toward. The verb qutila is passive (mabni lil-majhul), making as-habu the na'ib al-fa'il (substitute subject) in the nominative. Al-ukhdud is the mudaf ilayhi in the idafa as-hab al-ukhdud.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Qutila demonstrates the Form I passive past pattern (fu'ila) from root ق-ت-ل. The vowel shift from qatala (active: "he killed") to qutila (passive: "he was killed/cursed") is marked by damma on the first radical and kasra on the second. Al-ukhdud follows the uf'ul pattern from root خ-د-د, meaning a long trench or ditch.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The passive voice serves a dual purpose: (1) it is an imprecation -- "May they be cursed!" -- and (2) it conceals the agent because the agent is irrelevant; what matters is the condemnation. After three verses of cosmic oaths, the answer arrives in just three words -- a compressed, devastating judgment. The abruptness mirrors the severity of the crime.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="النَّارِ ذَاتِ الْوَقُودِ"
  transliteration="al-naari dhaati l-waqud"
  translation="The fire of abundant fuel"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:5"
  highlight="الْوَقُودِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | النَّارِ | al-naari | ن و ر | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Badal (appositive) explaining al-ukhdud - genitive (majrur) | the fire |
| 2 | ذَاتِ | dhaat | - | Noun - feminine, singular, possessive | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | possessing |
| 3 | الْوَقُودِ | al-waqud | و ق د | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) | the fuel |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Badal (Appositive) Construction">
- **al-nar**: Badal explaining what the trench contained -- it replaces al-ukhdud in grammatical function while specifying its nature
- **dhat al-waqud**: Possessing abundant fuel -- intensely burning fire, paralleling the structure of verse 1 (dhat al-buruj)
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Al-nar functions as badal (appositive) for al-ukhdud in verse 4, taking the same genitive case. Dhat al-waqud is a na't (adjective) + idafa construction paralleling verse 1's dhat al-buruj.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-waqud on the fa'ul pattern from root و-ق-د means fuel or firewood. This pattern often indicates the instrument or material of an action.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The structural parallel between dhat al-buruj (verse 1) and dhat al-waqud (verse 5) creates a chilling contrast: the sky "possessing" magnificent constellations is mirrored by the trench "possessing" abundant fuel for burning believers. The same grammatical construction frames cosmic beauty and human cruelty.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذْ هُمْ عَلَيْهَا قُعُودٌ"
  transliteration="idh hum 'alayha qu'uudun"
  translation="When they were sitting by it"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:6"
  highlight="قُعُودٌ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِذْ | idh | - | Particle - temporal | Temporal particle (zarf zaman) | when |
| 2 | هُمْ | hum | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person, masculine, plural | Subject (mubtada') | they |
| 3 | عَلَيْهَا | 'alayha | - | Preposition + pronoun | Prepositional phrase | upon it |
| 4 | قُعُودٌ | qu'uudun | ق ع د | Noun - active participle, masculine, plural, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | sitting ones |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Temporal Circumstantial Clause with idh">
- **idh**: "When" -- temporal circumstance clause setting the scene
- **qu'ud**: Active participle plural (fu'ul pattern) used as predicate -- describing their cold, deliberate sitting position by the fire as they watched believers burn
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Idh introduces a temporal clause. The nominal sentence hum... qu'udun has hum as mubtada' and qu'udun as khabar, with 'alayha as a prepositional phrase indicating location. The clause is adverbial, modifying the preceding condemnation.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Qu'ud is the plural of qa'id on the fu'ul pattern from root ق-ع-د. This plural pattern for active participles indicates multiple participants in the action of sitting.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The participle qu'ud (sitting) rather than a finite verb (qa'adu/"they sat") emphasizes the ongoing, deliberate nature of their presence. They were not passing by -- they were stationed, seated, watching. The scene is painted with chilling calm: fire below, persecutors seated above.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَهُمْ عَلَىٰ مَا يَفْعَلُونَ بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ شُهُودٌ"
  transliteration="wa-hum 'ala ma yaf'aluuna bi-l-mu'miniina shuhuudun"
  translation="And they were witnesses to what they were doing to the believers"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:7"
  highlight="شُهُودٌ,بِالْمُؤْمِنِينَ"

| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | هُمْ | hum | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person, masculine, plural | Subject (mubtada') | they |
| 3 | عَلَىٰ | 'ala | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | upon/over |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (ism mawsul) | what |
| 5 | يَفْعَلُونَ | yaf'aluuna | ف ع ل | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person, masculine, plural | Present verb in relative clause | they were doing |
| 6 | بِ | bi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | to |
| 7 | الْمُؤْمِنِينَ | al-mu'miniin | أ م ن | Noun - active participle, masculine, plural, definite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | the believers |
| 8 | شُهُودٌ | shuhuudun | ش ه د | Noun - active participle, masculine, plural, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | witnesses |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Conscious Witnessing as Aggravation">
- **shuhud**: Plural of shahid -- they watched their own evil deed with full awareness
- The word echoes verse 3's oath by shahid wa mashhud, creating a grim irony: the persecutors are themselves witnesses (shuhud) to their own crime
- Emphasizes their conscious, deliberate participation in persecution
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence with hum as mubtada' and shuhud as khabar. The prepositional phrase 'ala ma yaf'aluna bi-l-mu'minina is an extended relative clause modifying the predication. Ma is a relative pronoun introducing the verb yaf'aluna, and bi-l-mu'minina is the prepositional object.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Shuhud is the fu'ul plural of shahid (active participle from ش-ه-د). Al-mu'minina is the sound masculine plural of mu'min (active participle Form IV from أ-م-ن), taking the ya-nun ending in the genitive after bi.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse creates devastating irony through the vocabulary of witnessing. In verse 3, shahid wa mashhud was sworn by as something sacred. Here, the same root produces shuhud -- but these are witnesses to their own atrocity. The present tense yaf'aluna ("they are doing") makes the horror vivid and ongoing, as though the reader is watching it unfold.

### Verse 8

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا نَقَمُوا مِنْهُمْ إِلَّا أَن يُؤْمِنُوا بِاللَّهِ الْعَزِيزِ الْحَمِيدِ"
  transliteration="wa-ma naqamuu minhum illa an yu'minuu bi-llahi l-'azizi l-hamid"
  translation="And they resented them not except because they believed in Allah, the Exalted in Might, the Praiseworthy"

| 11 | الْحَمِيدِ | al-hamiid | ح م د | Noun - adjective, masculine, singular, definite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | the Praiseworthy |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Restriction with ma...illa and Masdar Mu'awwal">
- **ma naqamu... illa**: Restriction construction (hasr) -- "their only fault was..." The negation + exception narrows to a single cause
- **an yu'minu**: Masdar mu'awwal (interpreted infinitive) -- "that they believe" = "their believing." The an + subjunctive verb functions as a noun (masdar)
- **al-'Aziz al-Hamid**: Two divine attributes -- the All-Mighty, the All-Praiseworthy -- emphasizing the nobility of the God they believed in
- Ironic: persecuted for the most noble reason -- faith in Allah
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A restriction sentence (uslub al-hasr) using ma...illa. The verb naqamu takes minhum as its prepositional object. An yu'minu is a masdar mu'awwal functioning as the exception (mustathna), effectively: "except their believing." Al-'Aziz and al-Hamid are na't (adjectives) for Allah, both genitive.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yu'minu is Form IV (af'ala) from root أ-م-ن, in the subjunctive (mansub) after an, shown by the dropping of the final nun. Al-'Aziz follows the fa'il intensive pattern from ع-ز-ز (geminate root). Al-Hamid follows the fa'il pattern from ح-م-د.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The restriction construction creates devastating moral irony: after describing the horror of burning believers alive, the verse reveals their only "crime" was faith. The placement of divine attributes (al-'Aziz, al-Hamid) at the end is not accidental -- it reminds the reader that the God these believers died for is Mighty enough to avenge them and Praiseworthy in all He decrees.

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي لَهُ مُلْكُ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ ۚ وَاللَّهُ عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَيْءٍ شَهِيدٌ"

- **Allah... shahid**: Contrasts with human witnesses (verse 7) -- Allah is the ultimate Witness who sees all
- **'ala kulli shay'**: Universal scope -- over everything without exception
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Two sentences: (1) a relative clause alladhi lahu mulku s-samawati wa-l-ard, where lahu is a prepositional predicate (khabar muqaddam) and mulku is the subject (mubtada' mu'akhkhar); (2) a nominal sentence with Allah as mubtada' and shahid as khabar, with 'ala kulli shay'in as a prepositional phrase modifying shahid.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Shahid follows the fa'il intensive adjective pattern from ش-ه-د, meaning "ever-witnessing." Mulk from م-ل-ك on the fu'l pattern denotes dominion/sovereignty.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The word shahid creates a powerful echo: verse 3 swore by a shahid (witness), verse 7 condemned the persecutors as shuhud (witnesses to their own crime), and now Allah is declared shahid over all things. The root ش-ه-د threads through the entire surah, culminating here in divine oversight. No crime escapes His witness.

### Verse 10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَتُوبُوا فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ"

<Callout type="tip" title="Mercy Even After Atrocity">
- **fatanu**: To persecute by burning -- refers directly to the People of the Trench
- **thumma lam yatubu**: Condition -- "if they did not repent." Remarkably, even after such unspeakable evil, repentance was still possible
- **Double punishment**: 'adhab jahannam + 'adhab al-hariq -- punishment fitting the crime (they burned believers with fire, so they receive fire)
- **Mercy implicit**: The phrase thumma lam yatubu is one of the most astonishing expressions of divine mercy in the Quran -- even for those who burned believers alive, the door of repentance remained open
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** First in the inna emphasis chain (verses 10-13). Inna governs alladhina as its ism (subject, accusative). The relative clause fatanu l-mu'minina wa-l-mu'minat describes them. Thumma lam yatubu is a sequential clause with jussive verb. The fa introduces the result clause (jawab), with lahum as predicate (khabar muqaddam) and 'adhabu as subject (mubtada' mu'akhkhar).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Fatanu from root ف-ت-ن originally means "to test by fire/to melt gold" -- the literal meaning of burning is embedded in the root. Yatubu in the jussive after lam drops the final nun. Al-hariq from ح-ر-ق on the fa'il pattern means "the burning."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The double punishment ('adhab jahannam + 'adhab al-hariq) creates a poetic justice: those who burned believers with worldly fire will be burned with divine fire. The mention of both mu'minin (masculine) and mu'minat (feminine) honors every victim. The rhetorical genius is in thumma lam yatubu -- it is simultaneously a condemnation and an expression of infinite mercy.

### Verse 11

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Perfect Structural Contrast">
- **Contrast with verse 10**: Punishment for persecutors vs reward for believers -- same inna opening, opposite outcomes
- **jannatun tajri min tahtihaa al-anhar**: Classic Quranic description of Paradise -- gardens with flowing rivers
- **dhalika al-fawz al-kabir**: "That is the supreme achievement" -- a declarative sentence that redefines success: not worldly survival, but eternal reward
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Second inna in the chain, structurally parallel to verse 10 but with opposite content. Lahum jannatun mirrors lahum 'adhabu -- same prepositional predicate structure, opposite reward. Tajri min tahtiha l-anharu is a descriptive clause (jumla fi'liyya) modifying jannat. Dhalika l-fawzu l-kabiru is a separate nominal sentence.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Amanu is Form IV (af'ala) from أ-م-ن, the same root as mu'minin in verse 10. Al-salihat is the sound feminine plural of saliha (active participle from ص-ل-ح). Jannat is the plural of jannah from ج-ن-ن (to conceal/cover).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The parallel structure with verse 10 creates a devastating contrast: those who burned believers (fatanu) receive fire ('adhab al-hariq), while those who believed (amanu) receive gardens with rivers. The progression from fire in the trench to fire in Hell, and from martyrdom to gardens, demonstrates divine justice with perfect symmetry. Dhalika l-fawz al-kabir reframes the narrative: the believers who were burned alive achieved the "great success" -- not their persecutors.

### Verse 12

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ"
  transliteration="inna batsha rabbika la-shadiidun"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Emphasis: inna + lam al-Tawkid">
- **inna + lam**: Double emphasis -- the combination of inna at the beginning and lam on the predicate creates the strongest possible assertion of certainty
- **batsh**: Mighty seizure/grasp -- refers to Allah's power to punish wrongdoers with overwhelming force
- Warning to the persecutors: divine retribution is inevitable and devastating
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Third inna in the chain. Batsha rabbika is the ism inna (accusative), an idafa construction. La-shadiidun is the khabar inna (nominative), preceded by lam al-tawkid (the emphatic lam). This double emphasis (inna...la-) is the strongest affirmative construction in Arabic grammar.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Batsh from root ب-ط-ش on the fa'l pattern means "seizure, grip, strike with force." Shadid from ش-د-د (geminate root) on the fa'il pattern means "severe, intense." Both are concise, forceful words.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This is the shortest verse in the inna chain -- just five words -- yet carries the most concentrated force. The double emphasis (inna...la-) is reserved in the Quran for the most solemn declarations. After the extended narratives of verses 10-11, this verse strikes like the very batsh (seizure) it describes -- sudden, overwhelming, and inescapable. The address "your Lord" (rabbika) is intimate, directed to the Prophet.

### Verse 13

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُ هُوَ يُبْدِئُ وَيُعِيدُ"
  transliteration="innahu huwa yubdi'u wa-yu'iidu"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Damir al-Fasl (Pronoun of Separation)">
- **huwa**: Pronoun of separation (damir al-fasl) -- emphasizes exclusivity: "He alone" originates and repeats
- **yubdi' wa yu'id**: Creates the first time and recreates -- refers to original creation and resurrection
- Emphasizes Allah's complete power over life, death, and resurrection -- the persecutors cannot escape divine justice
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Fourth and final inna in the chain. The attached pronoun -hu on inna is the ism inna. Huwa functions as damir al-fasl (pronoun of separation), not as a grammatical subject -- it separates the subject from the predicate and adds emphasis. The verbal clause yubdi'u wa yu'idu is the khabar inna.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Both yubdi'u (from ب-د-أ) and yu'idu (from ع-و-د) are Form IV (yuf'ilu), which often carries causative meaning: "to cause to begin" and "to cause to return." The Form IV pattern indicates Allah's active agency in both creation and recreation.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The four-verse inna chain (10-13) builds a theological argument: (1) persecutors face punishment, (2) believers receive paradise, (3) Allah's seizure is severe, (4) He creates and resurrects. The chain moves from specific (this event) to universal (all existence). The pairing of yubdi' wa yu'id -- originating and repeating -- closes the argument by asserting that no one can escape accountability through death.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Stunning Juxtaposition: Severity and Love">
- **al-Ghafur**: Fa'ul pattern -- intensive forgiveness, exceeding all measure
- **al-Wadud**: Fa'ul pattern -- most loving/affectionate. This is one of the rarest divine attributes in the Quran, appearing only twice (here and in Hud 11:90)
- The balance is extraordinary: severe punishment (verse 12) followed immediately by abundant mercy and love -- even the persecutors can still repent (verse 10: thumma lam yatubu)
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence with huwa as mubtada' and al-Ghafur and al-Wadud as dual predicates (khabar). Both predicates are definite, creating equation sentences: He IS the Forgiving, He IS the Affectionate.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Both al-Ghafur (from غ-ف-ر) and al-Wadud (from و-د-د) follow the fa'ul intensive pattern. This pattern denotes one who performs an action abundantly, repeatedly, and by nature. Al-Wadud is from a geminate root (doubled second and third radicals), indicating intensity embedded in the root itself.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This is one of the most rhetorically powerful moments in the surah. After four verses of inna-emphasis culminating in "His seizure is severe" and "He creates and recreates," the surah pivots to al-Ghafur al-Wadud. The juxtaposition is not contradiction but completion: the same God who seizes severely also loves deeply. The placement of al-Wadud (the Affectionate/Loving) in a surah about persecution is profoundly consoling -- the believers who were burned were loved by a God who is al-Wadud.

### Verse 15

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ذُو الْعَرْشِ الْمَجِيدُ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Asma' al-Khamsa and Dual Adjective Reading">
- **dhu al-'arsh**: Possessor of the Throne -- dhu is one of the asma' al-khamsa (five special nouns) that take waw in the nominative. It symbolizes ultimate sovereignty
- **al-Majid**: Glorious/Majestic -- fa'il pattern intensive adjective
- May modify Allah (verse 14): "the Glorious [Lord]" or al-'arsh: "the Glorious Throne" -- both readings are valid and complement each other
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Dhu l-'arsh continues as a predicate (khabar) for the implied subject huwa from verse 14, or as a new predicate in a chain. Dhu is one of the asma' al-khamsa, taking waw (ذُو) in the nominative. Al-Majid can grammatically modify either Allah (as a predicate adjective) or al-'arsh (as a na't for the Throne).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-Majid from root م-ج-د on the fa'il pattern denotes nobility, glory, and generosity. Al-'arsh from ع-ر-ش on the fa'l pattern means throne or canopy.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The accumulation of divine attributes (al-Ghafur, al-Wadud, dhu l-'arsh, al-Majid) creates an ascending sequence of majesty. Each attribute adds a dimension: forgiveness, love, sovereignty, glory. The ambiguity of whether al-Majid describes Allah or the Throne is deliberate -- both readings enrich the meaning, and the Quran's multi-layered precision accommodates both.

### Verse 16

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Fa''al Intensive Pattern">
- **fa''al pattern**: The most intensive active participle form in Arabic -- "doing repeatedly, effectively, and without limitation." It is more intensive than both fa'il (shahid) and fa'ul (ghafur)
- **lima yurid**: Whatever He wills, He does -- absolute, unrestricted power
- Connects to verses 10-11: He punishes and rewards as He wills, and no force can prevent His decree
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Fa''alun is a khabar (predicate) continuing the chain of descriptions. Lima yurid is a prepositional phrase with a relative clause: li (preposition) + ma (relative pronoun) + yurid (present verb, indicative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Fa''al from root ف-ع-ل follows the fa''al pattern with doubled middle radical, the most intensive form of agency in Arabic morphology. Yurid is Form IV (yuf'ilu) from root ر-و-د, meaning "to will, to intend."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse is the climax of the divine attributes sequence (verses 14-16). The progression is: Forgiving and Loving (mercy), Owner of the Throne (sovereignty), Effecter of what He wills (absolute power). Fa''al is deliberately chosen over fa'il or fa'ul -- it is the ultimate intensive, signifying not just ability but habitual, effortless accomplishment of every intention. This is the theological anchor: whatever Allah wills, happens -- whether it is punishment, mercy, creation, or resurrection.

### Verse 17

<ArabicExample

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Rhetorical Question as Narrative Device">
- **hal**: Interrogative particle -- rhetorical question drawing attention, not seeking information
- This is a characteristic Quranic technique (also in 88:1 "hal ataka hadithu l-ghashiya") to introduce historical examples of divine punishment
- The shift from theological declaration (verses 12-16) to historical narrative creates variety and engagement
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A verbal interrogative sentence. Hal is an interrogative particle (does not affect i'rab). Ataka is a past tense verb with attached object pronoun -ka (you). Hadithu l-junud is the fa'il (subject) in an idafa construction.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ataka from root أ-ت-ي is a defective verb (the final radical ya appears as alif maqsura in some forms). Al-junud is the plural of jund on the fu'ul pattern from ج-ن-د.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical question hal ataka shifts the surah's register from cosmic theology to historical narrative. After the abstract power of verses 12-16, the surah now offers concrete proof: here are the legions who defied Allah -- what happened to them? The question format engages the listener directly, creating anticipation.

### Verse 18

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فِرْعَوْنَ وَثَمُودَ"

<Callout type="rule" title="Indeclinable Foreign Proper Nouns as Badal">
- **Fir'awn wa Thamud**: Badal (appositive) explaining "the legions" -- specifying who these armies were
- Two classic examples of tyrants destroyed by Allah -- Pharaoh for his water-based oppression, Thamud for their mountain-carved arrogance
- Foreign proper nouns -- indeclinable (mabni), maintaining fatha ending regardless of grammatical position
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both Fir'awna and Thamuda function as badal (appositives) for al-junud in verse 17, specifying which legions. As foreign proper nouns, they are mabni (indeclinable) -- they take fatha permanently rather than changing case endings.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Fir'awn is a non-Arabic proper noun (Egyptian/Coptic origin), and Thamud is an ancient Arabian tribal name. Both are mamnu' min al-sarf (diptote/partially declinable) due to being foreign or proper nouns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The brevity is devastating -- just two names, no elaboration needed. The Quranic audience knew these stories well. Pharaoh represents political tyranny; Thamud represents civilizational arrogance. Together they encompass every type of oppressor. The verse implies: if these mighty powers were destroyed, what chance do the People of the Trench or the Quraysh have?

### Verse 19

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | بَلِ | bal | - | Particle - adversative | Adversative conjunction | But rather |
| 2 | الَّذِينَ | alladhiina | - | Pronoun - relative, masculine, plural | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | those who |
| 3 | كَفَرُوا | kafaruu | ك ف ر | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, plural | Verb in relative clause | disbelieved |
| 4 | فِي | fi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | in |
| 5 | تَكْذِيبٍ | takdhiibin | ك ذ ب | Noun - verbal noun (masdar), masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | denial/rejection |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Adversative bal and Prepositional Predicate">
- **bal**: Adversative particle -- shifts from past examples to present reality, correcting a misconception
- **fi takdhib**: "In a state of denial" -- the preposition fi indicates they are immersed in denial, surrounded by it, as if denial is a place they inhabit
- Despite clear warnings from history, disbelievers continue rejecting the truth
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence with alladhina kafaru as mubtada' and fi takdhib as khabar (prepositional predicate). Bal introduces an adversative shift, correcting the implied question: "It's not that they lack evidence -- rather, they are in denial."

**Sarf (Morphology):** Takdhib is a taf'il masdar (verbal noun of Form II) from root ك-ذ-ب. The taf'il pattern indicates active, persistent denial -- not a single act but a continuous state.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from historical examples (Pharaoh, Thamud) to the present-tense statement about disbelievers creates urgency. The preposition fi is metaphorical -- denial is not something they do occasionally but a state they are submerged in. The indefiniteness of takdhib (with tanwin) universalizes it: not denial of a specific thing, but denial as a general condition.

### Verse 20

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَاللَّهُ مِن وَرَائِهِم مُّحِيطٌ"
  transliteration="wa-llahu min waraa'ihim muhiitun"
  translation="While Allah encompasses them from behind"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:20"
  highlight="مُّحِيطٌ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction (circumstantial) | while |
| 2 | اللَّهُ | Allah | - | Proper noun - definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | Allah |
| 3 | مِن | min | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | from |
| 4 | وَرَائِهِم | waraa'ihim | - | Noun - spatial + pronoun | Object of preposition with attached pronoun | behind them |
| 5 | مُحِيطٌ | muhiitun | ح و ط | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | Encompassing |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Circumstantial wa and Active Participle">
- **min wara'ihim**: "From behind/around them" -- they cannot escape; the spatial metaphor means there is no direction they can flee
- **muhit**: Active participle from root ح-و-ط (Form IV) -- completely encompassing/surrounding. The participle indicates an ongoing, permanent state of divine encompassing
- Allah's knowledge and power encompass all who deny, whether they realize it or not
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence with wa al-haliyya (circumstantial wa). Allah is mubtada', muhit is khabar, and min wara'ihim is an adverbial prepositional phrase modifying muhit.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Muhit is an active participle (ism fa'il) from Form IV (af'ala) of root ح-و-ط, on the muf'il pattern. The active participle indicates an ongoing, continuous state -- Allah is always encompassing.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse creates a terrifying image: while the disbelievers are "in" (fi) their denial, Allah is "from behind" (min wara'ihim) them -- surrounding them completely. They think they can hide in denial, but they are already encompassed. The circumstantial wa ("while") makes this simultaneous: at the very moment of their denial, Allah already surrounds them.

### Verse 21

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بَلْ هُوَ قُرْآنٌ مَّجِيدٌ"
  transliteration="bal huwa qur'aanun majiidun"
  translation="But it is a Glorious Quran"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:21"
  highlight="مَّجِيدٌ"
/>

| 2 | هُوَ | huwa | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | it |
| 3 | قُرْآنٌ | qur'aanun | ق ر أ | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | Quran/recitation |
| 4 | مَجِيدٌ | majiidun | م ج د | Noun - intensive adjective, masculine, singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - nominative (marfu') | glorious |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Second Adversative bal: Affirming the Quran">
- **bal**: Adversative -- refutes their denial (verse 19) and affirms the Quran's glory
- **Qur'an majid**: A glorious recitation -- emphasizes the nobility of this revelation
- The indefiniteness of both Qur'an and majid serves emphasis -- describing the quality rather than identifying a specific object
- Implicit: What they deny is actually glorious and true
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence with huwa as mubtada' and Qur'anun as khabar. Majidun is a na't (adjective) for Qur'an, both indefinite and nominative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Qur'an from root ق-ر-أ on the fu'lan pattern, meaning "that which is recited." Majid from root م-ج-د on the fa'il pattern, an intensive adjective meaning "glorious, noble, generous."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The second bal in the surah (first in verse 19) creates a double correction: (1) the disbelievers are in denial, but (2) what they deny is actually glorious. The word majid echoes verse 15 (al-Majid), connecting the Quran's glory to Allah's glory. The shift from denial to divine glory in just two verses demonstrates the Quran's rhetorical compression.

### Verse 22

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فِي لَوْحٍ مَّحْفُوظٍ"
  transliteration="fi lawhin mahfuuzin"
  translation="In a Preserved Tablet"
  reference="Al-Buruj 85:22"
  highlight="مَحْفُوظٍ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فِي | fi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | in |
| 2 | لَوْحٍ | lawhin | ل و ح | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | a Tablet |
| 3 | مَحْفُوظٍ | mahfuuzin | ح ف ظ | Noun - passive participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | preserved/protected |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Participle Completing the Surah's Participle Theme">
- **fi lawh mahfuz**: Locative prepositional phrase -- the Quran's eternal source is in a preserved tablet
- **mahfuz**: Passive participle (ism maf'ul) from root ح-ف-ظ -- guarded/protected from corruption, alteration, or destruction
- **al-Lawh al-Mahfuz**: The Preserved Tablet in Allah's presence containing all divine knowledge
- The surah's final word is a passive participle (mahfuz), bookending with the active/passive participle theme established in verse 3 (shahid/mashhud) and echoing verse 2 (maw'ud)
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A prepositional phrase (fi lawhin mahfuzin) functioning as an adjective or circumstantial description for Qur'an in verse 21. Both lawh and mahfuz are indefinite and genitive (majrur after fi). Mahfuz is a na't (adjective) for lawh.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Mahfuz follows the maf'ul passive participle pattern from root ح-ف-ظ, meaning "that which is guarded/preserved." Lawh from root ل-و-ح on the fa'l pattern means tablet, board, or surface for writing.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends not with a dramatic declaration but with a quiet, absolute certainty: fi lawhin mahfuz. The Quran -- denied by the disbelievers (verse 19), yet glorious (verse 21) -- is preserved in a tablet beyond human reach or corruption. The passive participle mahfuz completes a ring with the surah's participle theme (maw'ud v.2, shahid/mashhud v.3, mahfuz v.22), and its final position gives it the weight of a closing seal. The message: everything in this surah -- the oaths, the story, the condemnation, the theology -- is eternally preserved and beyond dispute.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify every active and passive participle in Surah Al-Buruj. For each, state its root, pattern, and whether it describes a human or divine attribute. What rhetorical pattern emerges from the distribution of participles across the surah?">

**Active Participles (ism fa'il / fa'il pattern):**
1. **shahid** (v.3) -- root ش-ه-د, fa'il pattern -- "witness" (ambiguous: cosmic/universal)
2. **qu'ud** (v.6) -- root ق-ع-د, fu'ul plural of qa'id -- "sitting ones" (human: persecutors)
3. **shuhud** (v.7) -- root ش-ه-د, fu'ul plural of shahid -- "witnesses" (human: persecutors)
4. **shahid** (v.9) -- root ش-ه-د, fa'il pattern -- "Witness" (divine attribute)
5. **muhit** (v.20) -- root ح-و-ط, muf'il Form IV active participle -- "Encompassing" (divine attribute)

**Passive Participles (ism maf'ul / maf'ul pattern):**
1. **maw'ud** (v.2) -- root و-ع-د, maf'ul pattern -- "promised" (describes the Day)
2. **mashhud** (v.3) -- root ش-ه-د, maf'ul pattern -- "witnessed" (ambiguous: cosmic/universal)
3. **mahfuz** (v.22) -- root ح-ف-ظ, maf'ul pattern -- "preserved" (describes the Tablet)

**Intensive Adjective Participles (fa'ul / fa'il / fa''al patterns):**
1. **al-'Aziz** (v.8) -- root ع-ز-ز, fa'il intensive -- "the Mighty" (divine)
2. **al-Hamid** (v.8) -- root ح-م-د, fa'il intensive -- "the Praiseworthy" (divine)
3. **shadid** (v.12) -- root ش-د-د, fa'il -- "severe" (describes divine seizure)
4. **al-Ghafur** (v.14) -- root غ-ف-ر, fa'ul intensive -- "the Most Forgiving" (divine)
5. **al-Wadud** (v.14) -- root و-د-د, fa'ul intensive -- "the Most Loving" (divine)
6. **al-Majid** (v.15) -- root م-ج-د, fa'il intensive -- "the Glorious" (divine)
7. **fa''al** (v.16) -- root ف-ع-ل, fa''al intensive -- "Effecter" (divine)
8. **majid** (v.21) -- root م-ج-د, fa'il intensive -- "glorious" (describes Quran)

**Rhetorical pattern:** Active participles describing humans portray them negatively (sitting by fire, witnessing atrocity), while active/intensive participles describing Allah portray absolute sovereignty and mercy. Passive participles frame the surah: the Promised Day (v.2), what is witnessed (v.3), and the Preserved Tablet (v.22) -- the arc from divine promise through human witnessing to eternal preservation.

<ExerciseBox question="Trace the four-verse inna emphasis chain (verses 10-13). For each verse, identify: (a) the ism inna (subject), (b) the khabar inna (predicate), and (c) whether additional emphasis devices (lam, damir al-fasl) are used. What is the rhetorical progression of the chain?">

**Verse 10:** إِنَّ الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ...
- **(a) Ism inna:** الَّذِينَ فَتَنُوا الْمُؤْمِنِينَ وَالْمُؤْمِنَاتِ (those who persecuted the believers)
- **(b) Khabar inna:** فَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ جَهَنَّمَ وَلَهُمْ عَذَابُ الْحَرِيقِ (for them is the punishment of Hell and the punishment of burning)
- **(c) Additional emphasis:** None beyond inna itself -- the double punishment serves as intensification
- **Topic:** Punishment of persecutors

**Verse 11:** إِنَّ الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ...
- **(a) Ism inna:** الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ (those who believed and did good deeds)
- **(b) Khabar inna:** لَهُمْ جَنَّاتٌ تَجْرِي مِن تَحْتِهَا الْأَنْهَارُ (for them are gardens beneath which rivers flow)
- **(c) Additional emphasis:** None beyond inna -- the vivid imagery carries the emphasis
- **Topic:** Reward of believers

**Verse 12:** إِنَّ بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ لَشَدِيدٌ
- **(a) Ism inna:** بَطْشَ رَبِّكَ (the seizure of your Lord)
- **(b) Khabar inna:** لَشَدِيدٌ (is surely severe)
- **(c) Additional emphasis:** لَ (lam al-tawkid) on the predicate -- DOUBLE emphasis (inna + lam), the strongest affirmative construction in Arabic
- **Topic:** Divine power/severity

**Verse 13:** إِنَّهُ هُوَ يُبْدِئُ وَيُعِيدُ
- **(a) Ism inna:** attached pronoun هُ (He, referring to Allah)
- **(b) Khabar inna:** يُبْدِئُ وَيُعِيدُ (originates and repeats)
- **(c) Additional emphasis:** هُوَ as damir al-fasl (pronoun of separation) -- adds exclusivity: "He ALONE"
- **Topic:** Divine power over creation/resurrection

**Rhetorical progression:**
1. **Specific punishment** (v.10) -- the persecutors' fate
2. **Specific reward** (v.11) -- the believers' reward
3. **Universal severity** (v.12) -- Allah's power to punish (double emphasis)
4. **Universal power** (v.13) -- Allah's control over existence itself (damir al-fasl)

The chain moves from particular (this event) to universal (all existence), with emphasis intensifying at each step.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the three intensive adjective patterns used for divine attributes in this surah: fa'il (e.g., al-'Aziz, al-Hamid, al-Majid), fa'ul (e.g., al-Ghafur, al-Wadud), and fa''al (fa''al). How does each pattern differ in intensity and meaning, and why does the surah use the most intensive pattern (fa''al) as the final attribute?">

**Fa'il Pattern** (فَعِيل): al-'Aziz, al-Hamid, al-Majid, Shahid
- **Intensity level:** High -- indicates a permanent, inherent quality
- **Meaning:** The quality is part of the being's essential nature
- **Examples:** al-'Aziz = "the inherently Mighty" (might is His nature); al-Hamid = "the inherently Praiseworthy" (praise is naturally His due)
- **Grammatical note:** Often functions as both adjective and noun; the definite article makes it a proper name/title

**Fa'ul Pattern** (فَعُول): al-Ghafur, al-Wadud
- **Intensity level:** Very high -- indicates abundant, overflowing action
- **Meaning:** The agent performs the action repeatedly, generously, and without measure
- **Examples:** al-Ghafur = "the One who forgives abundantly, repeatedly, without limit"; al-Wadud = "the One whose love overflows without measure"
- **Grammatical note:** More intensive than fa'il -- implies the action is done in extraordinary quantity

**Fa''al Pattern** (فَعَّال): Fa''al (in fa''alun lima yurid)
- **Intensity level:** The most intensive of all -- indicates perpetual, effortless, unrestricted action
- **Meaning:** The agent does the action constantly, effectively, and with absolute power -- nothing prevents or limits the action
- **Example:** Fa''al = "the One who effectuates whatever He wills, always, without obstacle or delay"
- **Grammatical note:** The doubled middle radical (shadda) physically embodies intensification in the morphology

**Why fa''al comes last:**
The sequence is deliberately ascending: fa'il (nature) to fa'ul (abundant action) to fa''al (absolute, unrestricted action). The surah builds to the ultimate statement of divine power. After establishing that Allah is inherently Mighty and Praiseworthy (fa'il), abundantly Forgiving and Loving (fa'ul), and Owner of the Throne and Glorious (fa'il), the final attribute is Fa''al -- the Effecter of absolutely everything He wills. This is the theological capstone: whatever He decides -- punishment, mercy, creation, resurrection -- it happens. No pattern in Arabic morphology expresses more intensive agency than fa''al.
