</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="A Masterclass in Oath Structures and Emphasis Particles">
At-Tariq is exceptional for grammar study because it contains two distinct oath sequences (verses 1-3 and 11-12), each with its own jawab al-qasam (answer). It showcases nearly every emphasis device in Arabic: inna with lam al-tawkid, in...lamma exceptive, min za'ida, ba' za'ida, and maf'ul mutlaq. The surah also demonstrates the full range of active participles used as nouns (al-tariq, al-thaqib, haafiz, dafiq, qadir, nasir) and features both Form II and Form IV imperatives from the same root in its final verse.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالسَّمَاءِ وَالطَّارِقِ"
  transliteration="wa-al-samaa'i wa-al-taariqi"
  translation="By the sky and the night-comer"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:1"
  highlight="الطَّارِقِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | By |
| 2 | السَّمَاءِ | al-samaa'i | س م و | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | the sky |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Oath particle (wa al-qasam) | And by |
| 4 | الطَّارِقِ | al-taariqi | ط ر ق | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, definite | Object of oath - genitive (majrur) | the night-comer |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Wa-Oath Construction">
- **Double wa-oath**: Swearing by two related celestial phenomena, both in genitive case as objects of the oath particle
- **al-tariq**: Active participle from taraqa (to knock/come at night) - the night visitor, referring to a celestial body that appears at night
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse opens with a qasam (oath) construction. The wa is the oath particle (not a conjunction), placing both al-samaa'i and al-taariqi in the genitive case (majrur). The jawab al-qasam (oath's answer) is delayed until verse 4, creating extended suspense across three verses.

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-taariqi follows the fa'il (active participle) pattern from the root ta-ra-qa. The definite article al- makes it refer to a specific, known entity. The root carries meanings of knocking, striking, and arriving at night.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Beginning with a cosmic oath elevates the discourse. The pairing of sky (vast, encompassing) with night-comer (specific, piercing) moves from the general to the particular, building curiosity. The listener is left wondering: what is this night-comer worthy of an oath alongside the entire sky?

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الطَّارِقُ"
  transliteration="wa-ma adraka ma al-taariqu"
  translation="And what can make you know what the night-comer is?"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:2"
  highlight="أَدْرَاكَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - interrogative | Interrogative pronoun (ism istifham) | what |
| 3 | أَدْرَاكَ | adraka | د ر ك | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular + pronoun | Past tense verb with object pronoun | made you know |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - interrogative | Interrogative pronoun (ism istifham) | what |
| 5 | الطَّارِقُ | al-taariqu | ط ر ق | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the night-comer |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The ma adraka Rhetorical Formula">
- **ma adraka**: A Quranic rhetorical question emphasizing the magnificence or incomprehensibility of what follows. It appears 13 times in the Quran and always signals something beyond human comprehension.
- **Form IV (adraka)**: Causative meaning - "what caused you to comprehend" - implying nothing in human experience can make one truly grasp this.
- Creates suspense before the answer in verse 3.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The first ma is an interrogative pronoun functioning as mubtada' (subject). adraka is the predicate verb with the attached pronoun -ka as its object. The second ma introduces a second interrogative clause (ma al-taariqu) where ma is mubtada' and al-taariqu is khabar (predicate), now in the nominative case (marfu') rather than the genitive it held in verse 1.

**Sarf (Morphology):** adraka is Form IV (af'ala pattern) from the root d-r-k, adding a causative meaning to the base concept of "perceiving/reaching." The alif prefix and the fatha vowel pattern mark this as Form IV past tense.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The ma adraka formula is one of the Quran's most powerful rhetorical devices. By asking "what could make you know?", it simultaneously elevates the subject beyond ordinary knowledge and creates an irresistible pull toward the answer. The repetition of al-tariq from verse 1, now in a question, transforms a simple oath object into a cosmic mystery demanding explanation.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="النَّجْمُ الثَّاقِبُ"
  transliteration="al-najmu al-thaaqibu"
  translation="The piercing star"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:3"
  highlight="الثَّاقِبُ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | النَّجْمُ | al-najmu | ن ج م | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Predicate (khabar) or badal explaining al-tariq - nominative (marfu') | the star |
| 2 | الثَّاقِبُ | al-thaaqibu | ث ق ب | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, definite | Adjective (na't) - nominative (marfu') | the piercing |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Active Participle as Descriptive Adjective">
- **al-najm al-thaqib**: The piercing/penetrating star - a noun followed by its active participle adjective, both definite and nominative
- **thaqib**: Active participle from thaqaba (to pierce) - that which pierces through darkness or the sky
- This verse answers the rhetorical question in verse 2, resolving the suspense with a vivid two-word image
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal fragment functioning as the answer (khabar) to the implied question from verse 2. al-najmu serves as khabar for the second ma in "ma al-taariqu" (i.e., al-taariqu huwa al-najmu al-thaaqibu). al-thaaqibu is a na't (adjective) matching its described noun in definiteness, gender, number, and case (nominative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-thaaqibu follows the fa'il active participle pattern from the root tha-qa-ba. Like al-taariqi in verse 1, it is an active participle used as a noun/adjective, showing a consistent morphological pattern in these opening verses: al-tariq (fa'il), al-thaqib (fa'il).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The answer is strikingly concise - just two words after the elaborate build-up. The star is described not by its beauty or position but by its action: piercing. This verb choice connects to the surah's themes of penetration (secrets being exposed, truth piercing through denial). The brevity itself is rhetorical - the answer needs no elaboration because the image speaks for itself.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِن كُلُّ نَفْسٍ لَّمَّا عَلَيْهَا حَافِظٌ"
  transliteration="in kullu nafsin lamma 'alayha haafizun"
  translation="There is no soul but that it has over it a guardian"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:4"
  highlight="حَافِظٌ,كُلُّ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِن | in | - | Particle - negative conditional | Negative conditional particle (harf nafy) | not |
| 2 | كُلُّ | kullu | - | Noun - universal quantifier, masculine, singular, construct | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | every |
| 3 | نَفْسٍ | nafsin | ن ف س | Noun - feminine, singular, indefinite | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) | soul |
| 4 | لَمَّا | lamma | - | Particle - exception/emphasis | Exceptive particle (harf istithnaa') meaning "but/except" | but/except |
| 5 | عَلَيْهَا | 'alayha | - | Preposition + pronoun | Prepositional phrase functioning as predicate | over it |
| 6 | حَافِظٌ | haafizun | ح ف ظ | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | a guardian |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The in...lamma Exceptive Construction">
- **in... lamma**: A strong negative-exceptive construction meaning "there is not... except" which effectively conveys "every" with added emphasis. in is a negative particle (not the conditional in), and lamma functions as an exceptive particle.
- **kull nafsin**: The universal quantifier kull in idafa with nafsin - every single soul without exception.
- **haafiz**: Active participle - a guardian angel in continuous watch over each person.
- This is the jawab al-qasam (answer to the oath) from verses 1-3: the oath by the piercing star leads to this declaration about divine guardianship.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a complex sentence serving as the jawab al-qasam. in is a negative particle (nafi), kull is mubtada' in idafa with nafsin (genitive). The lamma is an exceptive particle that, combined with in, creates the meaning "every...has." The prepositional phrase 'alayha + haafizun functions as the khabar (predicate). The entire structure: "There is not any soul except over it is a guardian."

**Sarf (Morphology):** haafizun follows the fa'il active participle pattern from h-f-z (to guard/protect). Its indefinite form (with tanwin) here emphasizes the concept of guardianship rather than identifying a specific guardian. nafsin uses the fa'l pattern from n-f-s, one of the most frequent nouns in the Quran.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After three verses of cosmic imagery (sky, star, piercing light), the oath resolves with an intimate, personal truth: every individual soul has a watcher. The shift from the vast (sky) to the personal (each soul) is a powerful rhetorical move. The in...lamma construction is stronger than simply saying "kull nafsin 'alayha haafiz" because the double negation (not...except) makes the universality emphatic and inescapable.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَلْيَنظُرِ الْإِنسَانُ مِمَّ خُلِقَ"
  transliteration="fal-yanzuri al-insaanu mimma khuliqa"
  translation="So let man observe from what he was created"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:5"
  highlight="فَلْيَنظُرِ,خُلِقَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - result/command | Result/imperative particle | so |
| 2 | لْ | li | - | Particle - command | Lam al-amr (command particle) | let |
| 3 | يَنظُرِ | yanzuri | ن ظ ر | Verb - Form I, present jussive, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Jussive verb after lam al-amr | he observe/look |
| 4 | الْإِنسَانُ | al-insaanu | أ ن س | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | the human |
| 5 | مِمَّ | mimma | - | Preposition + pronoun | Compound: min + ma (from what) | from what |
| 6 | خُلِقَ | khuliqa | خ ل ق | Verb - Form I, passive, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Passive verb | he was created |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Lam al-Amr: Third-Person Command">
- **fa-li-yanzur**: A command construction using the lam al-amr particle, which places the present tense verb into the jussive mood (majzum). This is the standard way to issue commands in the third person ("let him...").
- **mimma**: Contraction of min + ma - "from what" - the interrogative pronoun embedded in a prepositional phrase.
- **khuliqa**: Passive voice - humanity is the object of creation, not the agent. The fa'il (doer) is Allah, but He is not mentioned, focusing attention on the act itself.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** fa is a result particle connecting this verse to the previous declaration. The lam al-amr particle governs yanzuri, placing it in the jussive mood (the kasra on the final letter is due to the meeting of two sakin letters). al-insaanu is the fa'il (subject) in the nominative. mimma introduces an indirect question clause where khuliqa is a passive verb whose na'ib al-fa'il (deputy subject) is a hidden pronoun (huwa).

**Sarf (Morphology):** yanzuri is Form I from n-z-r (to look/observe) in the present tense jussive. khuliqa shows the passive voice pattern (u-i-a voweling) of Form I past tense from kh-l-q. The contraction mimma demonstrates a common phonological process where min + ma merge.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse pivots from cosmic oath and divine guardianship to human self-reflection. The command is indirect (third-person "let him look") rather than direct ("look!"), which is more dignified and universal - addressing all of humankind through the generic al-insan. The passive voice khuliqa removes human agency entirely: you did not create yourself, so examine what created you.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="خُلِقَ مِن مَّاءٍ دَافِقٍ"
  transliteration="khuliqa min maa'in daafiqin"
  translation="He was created from a fluid ejected"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:6"
  highlight="دَافِقٍ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | خُلِقَ | khuliqa | خ ل ق | Verb - Form I, passive, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Passive verb | he was created |
| 2 | مِن | min | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition indicating source | from |
| 3 | مَاءٍ | maa'in | م و ه | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | fluid/water |
| 4 | دَافِقٍ | daafiqin | د ف ق | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | ejected/gushing |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Active Participle Describing an Inanimate Noun">
- **ma' dafiq**: Gushing/ejecting fluid - the active participle dafiq is used to describe the fluid (ma'), attributing the quality of gushing/pouring forth as an inherent characteristic.
- **dafiq**: Active participle from dafaqa (to pour/gush) - describes the fluid by its defining action.
- This verse answers the question "from what was he created?" posed in verse 5.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse is a continuation answering the question from verse 5. khuliqa is repeated in passive voice with a hidden na'ib al-fa'il (huwa = the human). The prepositional phrase min maa'in provides the source/material of creation. daafiqin is a na't (adjective) matching maa'in in indefiniteness, gender, number, and case (genitive).

**Sarf (Morphology):** daafiqin follows the fa'il active participle pattern from d-f-q. This is another instance of the surah's recurring pattern of using active participles (al-tariq, al-thaqib, haafiz, and now dafiq). The root carries the meaning of pouring forth, gushing, or ejecting with force.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The answer to the grand question of human origins is deliberately humbling: a gushing fluid. After the cosmic grandeur of stars and sky, the surah brings the listener face to face with biological reality. The active participle dafiq gives the fluid agency and motion, making the description vivid. The humility of origin contrasts with the arrogance that leads to denial of resurrection.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَخْرُجُ مِن بَيْنِ الصُّلْبِ وَالتَّرَائِبِ"
  transliteration="yakhruju min bayni al-sulbi wa-al-taraa'ibi"

| 2 | مِن | min | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | from |
| 3 | بَيْنِ | bayni | - | Noun - locative, construct state | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | between |

| 6 | التَّرَائِبِ | al-taraa'ibi | ت ر ب | Noun - feminine, plural, definite | Second part of dual idafa - genitive (majrur) | the ribs |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Locative bayn with Dual Reference">
- **yakhruju**: Present tense verb describing the fluid (ma') from verse 6, giving a continuous/habitual sense.
- **min bayn al-sulb wa al-tara'ib**: A locative construction where bayn (between) takes two objects connected by wa, both in the genitive. This refers to the procreative areas of the human body.
- The shift from past passive (khuliqa) to present active (yakhruju) makes the description vivid and ongoing.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** yakhruju is a present tense verb (fi'l mudari' marfu') with a hidden pronoun (huwa) referring to ma' (the fluid) from verse 6. The prepositional phrase min bayni specifies location. bayn is in idafa with a compound noun phrase: al-sulbi wa al-taraa'ibi, both genitive as the second element of the idafa.

**Sarf (Morphology):** yakhruju follows the yaf'ulu present tense pattern of Form I from kh-r-j (to exit/emerge). al-taraa'ibi follows the fawa'il broken plural pattern from the root t-r-b, referring to the chest bones/ribs. al-sulbi uses the fu'l pattern from s-l-b, meaning the backbone or loins.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse continues the humbling description of human origin. The present tense yakhruju (it emerges) makes the biological process vivid and immediate, as if witnessing it happening now. This literary device (using present tense for habitual/eternal truths) reminds the listener that creation is not a distant past event but an ongoing divine act. The specificity of anatomical detail (backbone and ribs) grounds the cosmic discussion in physical reality.

### Verse 8

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ"
  transliteration="innahu 'ala raj'ihi la-qaadirun"
  translation="Indeed, He is Able to return him"
  reference="At-Tariq 86:8"
  highlight="لَقَادِرٌ"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّهُ | innahu | - | Particle + pronoun | Emphasis particle with attached pronoun (ism inna) | indeed He |
| 2 | عَلَىٰ | 'ala | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | upon/over |
| 3 | رَجْعِهِ | raj'ihi | ر ج ع | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + pronoun | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) + possessive | his return |
| 4 | لَ | la | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (lam al-tawkid) | surely |
| 5 | قَادِرٌ | qaadirun | ق د ر | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate of inna (khabar inna) - nominative (marfu') | Able/Capable |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Emphasis: inna + lam al-tawkid">
- **inna + lam**: The combination of inna (emphasis particle at sentence start) with lam al-tawkid (emphasis lam prefixed to the predicate) creates the strongest possible emphatic assertion in Arabic: "Indeed, He is SURELY Able."
- **'ala raj'ihi qadir**: Able to return him - the pronoun in raj'ihi refers to the human being, establishing the argument for resurrection.
- The logical argument: He who created from a lowly fluid can certainly recreate from bones and dust.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** inna governs the attached pronoun -hu as its ism (subject) in the accusative. The prepositional phrase 'ala raj'ihi is part of the predicate complex. la-qaadirun is the khabar of inna (predicate) in the nominative, prefixed with the emphatic lam. The possessive pronoun in raj'ihi creates an idafa-like structure.

**Sarf (Morphology):** qaadirun follows the fa'il active participle pattern from q-d-r (to be able/powerful). raj'ihi is a masdar (verbal noun) from r-j-' (to return) on the fa'l pattern, with the possessive pronoun -hi attached.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse is the theological climax of the creation argument (verses 5-7). The double emphasis (inna...la-) matches the weight of the claim: resurrection. The argument is elegant in its simplicity - the God who brought you from a mere fluid to a complex being can certainly bring you back. The word raj' (return) will echo in verse 11 (al-raj') connecting divine power over human resurrection with divine power over cosmic cycles.

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَ تُبْلَى السَّرَائِرُ"
  transliteration="yawma tubla al-saraa'iru"
  translation="The Day when secrets will be put on trial"

| 3 | السَّرَائِرُ | al-saraa'iru | س ر ر | Noun - feminine, plural, definite | Subject (na'ib al-fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | the secrets |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice with Feminine Plural Subject">
- **yawma**: Temporal specification in the accusative (mansub), answering "when" the return (raj') will occur.
- **tubla**: Passive form of balaa (to test/try) - secrets are tested, examined, and exposed. The verb is feminine singular to agree with the broken plural al-saraa'ir.
- **al-sara'ir**: Broken plural of sariira (secret) on the fawa'il pattern - encompasses all hidden things: inner thoughts, intentions, secret deeds.
- On Judgment Day, all concealed matters will be laid bare for examination.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** yawma is a zarf (adverbial of time) in the accusative (mansub), modifying the concept of raj' (return) from verse 8. tubla is a passive verb (fi'l mudari' mabni li-l-majhul) whose na'ib al-fa'il (deputy subject) is al-saraa'iru, which takes the nominative case. The verb is feminine singular because Arabic broken plurals of non-human nouns take feminine singular agreement.

**Sarf (Morphology):** tubla is the passive present of Form I from b-l-w (to test/try). The passive pattern changes the voweling to tu-f'a-la. al-saraa'iru follows the fawa'il broken plural pattern from the root s-r-r, the singular being sariira (secret).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The choice of tubla (to test/try) rather than tukshaf (to reveal) is significant. Secrets are not merely uncovered but put on trial - examined, weighed, and judged. This connects to the theme of the haafiz (guardian) in verse 4 who has been recording these secrets. The image of al-saraa'ir being tested echoes the piercing star (al-thaqib) that penetrates darkness - just as the star pierces the night sky, divine judgment pierces through all concealment.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="min za'ida: Emphatic Negation Particle">
- **ma lahu min quwwa**: The min here is za'ida (extra/emphatic), not partitive. It strengthens the negation to mean "he has absolutely no power whatsoever." Without min, the negation would be ordinary; with min, it becomes absolute.
- **wa la nasir**: Coordinated with the negation - and no helper either. Complete helplessness on two fronts: internal strength and external aid.
- On the Day of Judgment, the human stands powerless without divine mercy.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** fa indicates a result or consequence. ma is a negation particle. lahu is a prepositional phrase functioning as the khabar (predicate), placed before the mubtada'. min is za'ida (extra/emphatic), which is why quwwatin appears in the genitive despite being the mubtada' - it takes the case from min za'ida while functionally remaining the subject. wa la naasirin continues the negation with la reinforcing the denial.

**Sarf (Morphology):** quwwatin is a masdar from the root q-w-y on the fu'la pattern, indicating strength/power. naasirin follows the fa'il active participle pattern from n-s-r (to help/aid), meaning one who helps or aids.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse presents total helplessness through a comprehensive two-part negation: no internal power (quwwa) and no external supporter (nasir). The min za'ida intensifies each denial to the absolute. This structural completeness - covering both self-reliance and reliance on others - leaves no escape route for the human on Judgment Day. The verse forms a stark contrast with the assertion of Allah's power (qadir) in verse 8.

### Verse 11

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالسَّمَاءِ ذَاتِ الرَّجْعِ"
  transliteration="wa-al-samaa'i dhaati al-raj'i"
  translation="By the sky which returns"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Second Oath Series and the raj' Echo">
- **Second oath series** begins here (verses 11-12), paralleling the first series (verses 1-3).
- **dhat al-raj'**: Sky that returns - refers to the rain cycle (clouds returning rain), celestial cycles, or cosmic recurrence.
- Crucially, this parallels verse 8 (raj'ihi) - just as the sky returns rain in cycles, Allah returns souls to life. The word raj' creates a thematic bridge between human resurrection and cosmic cycles.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse opens the second qasam (oath) sequence. The structure mirrors verse 1: wa (oath particle) + al-samaa'i (genitive). dhaati is a na't (adjective) for al-samaa'i, agreeing in case (genitive) and gender (feminine). dhaati is in idafa with al-raj'i, creating a possessive construction: "the sky possessing the return."

**Sarf (Morphology):** dhaati is the feminine form of dhuu (possessor), used with feminine nouns. al-raj'i is a masdar (verbal noun) from r-j-' on the fa'l pattern. The same root appeared in verse 8 (raj'ihi), creating lexical cohesion.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah returns to its opening motif - swearing by the sky - but now with a different attribute. In verse 1, the sky was paired with the night-comer (a specific phenomenon). Here, the sky is characterized by its quality of returning (rain, cycles). This verbal echo of raj' from verse 8 is masterful: the sky demonstrates "return" in the physical world, validating the claim of human "return" (resurrection) in the metaphysical world. Nature itself testifies to the truth of resurrection.

### Verse 12

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالْأَرْضِ ذَاتِ الصَّدْعِ"
  transliteration="wa-al-ardi dhaati al-sad'i"
  translation="And by the earth which splits"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Sky-Earth Pairing in Oath Constructions">
- **dhat al-sad'**: Earth that splits - refers to plants breaking through soil, earthquakes, or cracks for water springs.
- Parallel structure to verse 11 (sky/earth pair) - the oath pairs cosmic phenomena in matching grammatical constructions: al-samaa'i dhaati X / al-ardi dhaati X.
- Both verses show divine signs in nature: rain returns from the sky, life splits through the earth. Both point to resurrection.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Perfectly parallel to verse 11: wa (oath) + al-ardi (genitive) + dhaati (genitive na't) + al-sad'i (genitive, second part of idafa). The grammatical parallelism between verses 11 and 12 creates a balanced pair of oaths.

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-sad'i is a masdar from s-d-' (to split/crack) on the fa'l pattern. dhaati is again the feminine possessive adjective, matching al-ard (feminine noun) in gender and case.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The sky-earth pairing is a common Quranic device (found also in al-Buruj 85:1, and many other surahs). Sky returns (rain descends), earth splits (plants ascend) - together they describe the cycle of life. This natural cycle serves as the earthly proof of resurrection: if the earth can bring forth life from dead soil every spring, can Allah not bring forth the dead from their graves? The choice of sad' (splitting/cracking) is vivid and forceful, evoking the image of sprouts cracking through hard ground.

### Verse 13

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُ لَقَوْلٌ فَصْلٌ"
  transliteration="innahu la-qawlun faslun"

  reference="At-Tariq 86:13"

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّهُ | innahu | - | Particle + pronoun | Emphasis particle with attached pronoun | indeed it |
| 2 | لَ | la | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (lam al-tawkid) | surely |

| 4 | فَصْلٌ | faslun | ف ص ل | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - nominative (marfu') | decisive/distinguishing |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Jawab al-Qasam with inna + lam">
- **innahu**: The pronoun refers to the Quran or the message about resurrection. This is the jawab al-qasam (answer) to the oaths in verses 11-12.
- **qawl fasl**: A decisive, conclusive word - one that distinguishes and separates truth from falsehood. The adjective fasl (from fasala, to separate) emphasizes the Quran's role as the ultimate criterion.
- The double emphasis (inna + la-) mirrors the structure of verse 8, creating a parallel: just as Allah is certainly able to resurrect (v.8), the Quran is certainly a decisive word (v.13).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** inna governs the attached pronoun -hu as its ism in the accusative. la-qawlun is the khabar (predicate) of inna in the nominative, preceded by the emphatic lam. faslun is a na't (adjective) for qawlun, matching in case (nominative), gender, number, and definiteness (both indefinite).

**Sarf (Morphology):** qawlun is a masdar from q-w-l (to say) on the fa'l pattern. faslun is from f-s-l (to separate/distinguish) on the same fa'l pattern. Both are masdar forms used as adjective-like descriptions - a word that is characterized by decisiveness.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The indefiniteness of both qawlun and faslun (with tanwin) serves emphasis through a rhetorical device called tankir li-l-ta'zim (indefiniteness for magnification). Rather than saying "the decisive word" (which would identify), the surah says "a decisive word" which amplifies - it is so decisive that it defies specific categorization. The verse echoes the structure of verse 8 (innahu...la-qaadirun), creating a rhetorical parallel: divine power (v.8) validated by divine speech (v.13).

### Verse 14

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا هُوَ بِالْهَزْلِ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="ba' za'ida: Emphatic ba' in Negation">
- **ma huwa bi-al-hazl**: Strong negation with ba' za'ida (extra/emphatic ba'). Without ba', it would be "ma huwa al-hazl" (it is not jest). With ba', the negation becomes emphatic: "it is absolutely not jest/play."
- The ba' za'ida causes the predicate al-hazl to appear in the genitive case, even though functionally it is a khabar (predicate) which normally takes the nominative.
- After the positive emphasis in verse 13, verse 14 reinforces through negative emphasis - stating what it is NOT.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** wa is a conjunction. ma is a negation particle (Hijazi dialect treats this like laysa, which is the basis for the ba' za'ida). huwa is mubtada' (subject) in the nominative. bi-al-hazli: the ba' is za'ida (extra), and al-hazli is the khabar (predicate) pulled into the genitive by ba' though functionally nominative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-hazli is a masdar from h-z-l (to jest/play) on the fa'l pattern. It denotes frivolity, joking, or lack of seriousness.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the positive affirmation (v.13: "it IS a decisive word"), the negative affirmation follows (v.14: "it is NOT jest"). This positive-then-negative pairing is a powerful rhetorical technique that leaves no room for ambiguity. The choice of hazl (jest/play) directly addresses the dismissive attitude of those who treated Quranic warnings as entertainment. The ba' za'ida adds rhetorical weight to the denial, making it not just a negation but an indignant repudiation.

### Verse 15

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُمْ يَكِيدُونَ كَيْدًا"
  transliteration="innahum yakiiduuna kaydan"
  translation="Indeed, they are planning a plan"

| 3 | كَيْدًا | kaydan | ك ي د | Noun - verbal noun (masdar), masculine, singular, indefinite | Absolute object (maf'ul mutlaq) - accusative (mansub) | a plot |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Maf'ul Mutlaq: Cognate Accusative for Emphasis">
- **yakidun kaydan**: This is a maf'ul mutlaq (cognate accusative/absolute object) construction where the verb and its object share the same root (k-y-d). The effect is to emphasize the intensity and reality of the action: "they are TRULY plotting a REAL plot."
- The masdar kaydan reinforces the verb yakidun, making the plotting emphatic and undeniable.
- Refers to the disbelievers' schemes against the Prophet and the Quranic message.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** inna governs the attached pronoun -hum as its ism. The verbal sentence yakiiduuna kaydan functions as the khabar (predicate) of inna. kaydan is a maf'ul mutlaq (absolute/cognate object) in the accusative, derived from the same root as the verb.

**Sarf (Morphology):** yakiiduuna is Form I present tense from k-y-d (to plot/scheme), conjugated for third person masculine plural. kaydan is the masdar (verbal noun) of the same root on the fa'l pattern. The shared root creates morphological unity between verb and object.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The maf'ul mutlaq is one of Arabic's most emphatic constructions. By using both the verb and its cognate noun, the plotting is described with maximum intensity. This sets up the devastating parallel in verse 16, where Allah uses the exact same construction for His own counter-plan. The disbelievers' plotting, however intense, will be met with a divine response using the same verbal weapon - but infinitely more powerful.

### Verse 16

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَكِيدُ كَيْدًا"

| 3 | كَيْدًا | kaydan | ك ي د | Noun - verbal noun (masdar), masculine, singular, indefinite | Absolute object (maf'ul mutlaq) - accusative (mansub) | a plot |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Divine Counter-Plan: Parallel Structure with Verse 15">
- **akidu kaydan**: Allah's counter-plan using the exact same maf'ul mutlaq construction as verse 15.
- The parallel structure (yakiiduuna kaydan / akiidu kaydan) creates a direct comparison: their collective plotting (plural) versus Allah's singular response.
- Implicit subject: Allah (1st person singular) - the use of first person is powerful and direct.
- The juxtaposition emphasizes that their plotting is futile against divine strategy.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** wa is a conjunction (some read it as adversative "but"). akiidu is a present tense verb with a hidden subject (ana = I, referring to Allah). kaydan is again a maf'ul mutlaq in the accusative. The sentence structure perfectly mirrors verse 15.

**Sarf (Morphology):** akiidu is the same root k-y-d as yakiiduuna in verse 15, but conjugated for first person singular (a-prefix). The morphological shift from ya-kiiduuna (3rd person plural) to a-kiidu (1st person singular) is the only change - same root, same form, same masdar.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical power here is extraordinary. Using the exact same root, the exact same grammatical construction, but shifting from "they" (plural, many plotters) to "I" (singular, one Planner) creates an overwhelming contrast. Their collective scheming meets one divine response. The word kayd when attributed to Allah does not mean "deceit" but rather strategic counter-measure and perfect justice. The brevity of this verse (just three words) compared to verse 15 (also three words) creates perfect symmetry, while the shift in person creates maximum impact.

### Verse 17

<ArabicExample

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form II vs Form IV Imperatives from the Same Root">
- **mahhil (Form II) vs amhil (Form IV)**: Both derive from the root m-h-l (to give respite) but from different verb forms. Form II (fa''ala) often indicates intensity, while Form IV (af'ala) indicates causation. The repetition using different forms emphasizes the command through variation.
- **ruwaydan**: A diminutive form from the root r-w-d, meaning "a little while." The diminutive morphology (fu'ayl pattern) shrinks the time period, implying that their respite is tiny and limited.
- Command to the Prophet: Be patient with their denial, for their allotted time is short. Divine response will come in Allah's perfect timing.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** fa is a result particle. mahhili is a Form II imperative with al-kaafiriina as its maf'ul bihi (direct object) in the accusative. amhilhum is a Form IV imperative with the attached pronoun -hum as its object. ruwaydan functions as a maf'ul mutlaq or hal (adverbial accusative), modifying the manner/duration of the respite.

**Sarf (Morphology):** mahhili is Form II (taf'il) imperative from m-h-l - the doubling of the middle radical (hh) is characteristic of Form II. amhilhum is Form IV (if'al) imperative from the same root - the hamza prefix is characteristic of Form IV. ruwaydan follows the fu'ayl diminutive pattern from r-w-d, transforming rawda/rawd into a diminished form that literally means "a tiny bit."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The final verse is a masterpiece of rhetorical closure. The command is given twice using different verb forms (Form II then Form IV), not for redundancy but for emphasis through variation (tanwi'). The diminutive ruwaydan is the surah's final word - a tiny, delicate word that carries enormous weight. After all the cosmic oaths, creation arguments, and descriptions of divine power, the surah ends by reducing the disbelievers' remaining time to something diminutive. The contrast between the grandeur of the preceding content and the smallness of ruwaydan is devastatingly effective.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="This surah contains two distinct oath sequences (verses 1-3 and verses 11-12). Compare their structures: what is the grammatical pattern of each oath, what is the jawab al-qasam (answer) for each, and how do the two oaths relate thematically?">

**First Oath Sequence (Verses 1-3):**
- **Structure:** wa + al-samaa'i (genitive) + wa + al-taariqi (genitive), followed by a rhetorical question (ma adraka), then the answer (al-najmu al-thaaqibu)
- **Jawab al-qasam:** Verse 4 - in kullu nafsin lamma 'alayha haafizun ("Every soul has a guardian")
- **Theme:** Celestial phenomena (sky + piercing star) leading to divine guardianship over souls

**Second Oath Sequence (Verses 11-12):**
- **Structure:** wa + al-samaa'i dhaati al-raj'i (genitive + descriptive adjective) + wa + al-ardi dhaati al-sad'i (genitive + descriptive adjective)
- **Jawab al-qasam:** Verse 13 - innahu la-qawlun faslun ("Indeed, it is a decisive statement")
- **Theme:** Natural cycles (sky returning rain, earth splitting with life) leading to the truth of the Quranic message

**Thematic Connection:**
- Both oaths mention al-samaa' (the sky) but with different attributes
- The first oath focuses on what pierces (al-thaqib) - connecting to the piercing revelation of secrets (v.9)
- The second oath focuses on what returns (al-raj') - connecting to resurrection (v.8) using the same root r-j-'
- Together they frame the central argument: just as the sky has watchers and cycles, so does human life have guardians and a return
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Identify all the active participles (ism fa'il) used in this surah. List each one with its root, the verse it appears in, and whether it functions as a noun, adjective, or predicate. What pattern do you notice about this surah's use of active participles?">

**Active Participles in At-Tariq:**

1. **الطَّارِقِ** (al-taariqi) - Root: ط ر ق - Verse 1 - Functions as a **noun** (object of oath)
2. **الثَّاقِبُ** (al-thaaqibu) - Root: ث ق ب - Verse 3 - Functions as an **adjective** (describing al-najm)
3. **حَافِظٌ** (haafizun) - Root: ح ف ظ - Verse 4 - Functions as a **predicate** (khabar)
4. **دَافِقٍ** (daafiqin) - Root: د ف ق - Verse 6 - Functions as an **adjective** (describing ma')
5. **قَادِرٌ** (qaadirun) - Root: ق د ر - Verse 8 - Functions as a **predicate** (khabar inna)
6. **نَاصِرٍ** (naasirin) - Root: ن ص ر - Verse 10 - Functions as a **noun** (subject in negative construction)
7. **الْكَافِرِينَ** (al-kaafiriina) - Root: ك ف ر - Verse 17 - Functions as a **noun** (direct object)

**Pattern observed:** The surah is remarkably rich in active participles (7 instances across 17 verses). All follow the fa'il pattern. They serve to describe ongoing states and inherent qualities rather than momentary actions. The participles create a web of agents: the night-comer who arrives, the star that pierces, the guardian who watches, the fluid that gushes, the God who is able, the helper who is absent, and the disbelievers who deny. This preference for participles over simple adjectives gives the surah a sense of active, continuous reality.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Verse 8 uses inna...la- (double emphasis) and verse 10 uses ma...min za'ida (emphatic negation). Explain the grammatical mechanics of each emphasis device and describe how they create a rhetorical contrast between Allah's power and human helplessness.">

**Verse 8: إِنَّهُ عَلَىٰ رَجْعِهِ لَقَادِرٌ**
- **inna** places the attached pronoun -hu in the accusative as its ism (subject) and emphasizes the entire proposition
- **la-** (lam al-tawkid) prefixed to the khabar qaadirun adds a second layer of emphasis
- **Grammatical effect:** Double emphasis = "He is MOST CERTAINLY Able"
- **Device:** Positive intensification of capability

**Verse 10: فَمَا لَهُ مِن قُوَّةٍ وَلَا نَاصِرٍ**
- **ma** negates the existence of something for the person (lahu)
- **min** is za'ida (extra/emphatic), not partitive, causing quwwatin to take genitive case despite being the functional subject
- **Grammatical effect:** The min intensifies the negation from "he has no strength" to "he has absolutely NO strength whatsoever"
- **Device:** Negative intensification of incapability

**Rhetorical Contrast:**
- Verse 8 uses Arabic's strongest POSITIVE emphasis (inna + la-) to affirm Allah's power
- Verse 10 uses Arabic's strongest NEGATIVE emphasis (ma + min za'ida + la) to deny human power
- The juxtaposition is devastating: Allah = maximally capable; the human = maximally helpless
- This contrast is the surah's core theological argument for why resurrection is certain and why denial is futile
