# At-Takathur (Competition in Increase)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 8
- **Theme:** This surah warns against being distracted by competition for worldly possessions and status (takathur), neglecting preparation for the Hereafter. It emphasizes that certainty of knowledge about death and the grave should motivate different priorities.
- **Grammar Focus:** Form IV causative (أَلْهَاكُمُ) and Form VI reciprocal (التَّكَاثُرُ), كَلَّا emphatic rebuke particle (used three times), سَوْفَ future tense marker, لَوْ contrary-to-fact conditional, مَفْعُول مُطْلَق (absolute object), لَ + emphatic نون double emphasis, passive voice, epistemological progression (عِلْم اليَقِين → عَيْن اليَقِين), ثُمَّ for escalation

### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | أَلْهَاكُمُ التَّكَاثُرُ | Verbal (past tense) | Form IV causative + Form VI verbal noun | Competition distracted you |
| 2 | حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ | Verbal (past tense) | حَتَّى limit particle + euphemism | Until you reached the graves |
| 3 | كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ | Verbal (emphatic) | كَلَّا rebuke + سَوْفَ future | First warning: you will know |
| 4 | ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ | Verbal (emphatic) | ثُمَّ escalation + repeated warning | Second warning: intensified |
| 5 | كَلَّا لَوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ | Verbal (conditional) | لَوْ contrary-to-fact + maf'ul mutlaq | If you had certain knowledge |
| 6 | لَتَرَوُنَّ الْجَحِيمَ | Verbal (emphatic) | لَ emphasis + emphatic نون | You will surely see Hellfire |
| 7 | ثُمَّ لَتَرَوُنَّهَا عَيْنَ الْيَقِينِ | Verbal (emphatic) | ثُمَّ escalation + عَيْن اليَقِين | You will see it with visual certainty |
| 8 | ثُمَّ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ النَّعِيمِ | Verbal (passive + emphatic) | Passive voice + emphatic نون | You will be asked about blessings |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Surah of Escalating Warnings">
At-Takathur is structured as a rising crescendo of warnings. كَلَّا (No!) appears three times (verses 3, 4, 5), each louder than the last. The future marker سَوْفَ (verses 3-4) gives way to the emphatic لَ + نون (verses 6-8). The conjunction ثُمَّ (then/moreover) appears four times (verses 4, 7, 8), each time escalating: from warning to double-warning, from seeing Hellfire to seeing it with certainty, to being questioned about blessings. Even the epistemology escalates: عِلْم اليَقِين (knowledge of certainty, verse 5) → عَيْن اليَقِين (eye of certainty, verse 7). The grammar mirrors the message — everything builds toward inescapable accountability.

/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَلْهَاكُمُ | alhākumu | ل ه و | Verb - Form IV, past, 3rd person masculine singular + pronoun | Past verb (mabni), subject concealed (huwa), object pronoun (kum) accusative | It distracted you |
| 2 | التَّكَاثُرُ | al-takāthuru | ك ث ر | Noun - verbal noun (Form VI), masculine, singular, definite | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | The mutual competition/vying for increase |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IV أَلْهَى vs. Form VI التَّكَاثُر: Two Verb Forms in One Verse">
This verse pairs two augmented verb forms. أَلْهَاكُمُ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) from root ل-ه-و: the base لَهَا means "to be distracted/amused," while Form IV أَلْهَى adds causative force — "to cause distraction, to divert." التَّكَاثُرُ is the verbal noun (مَصْدَر) of Form VI (تَفَاعُلَ) from root ك-ث-ر: the base كَثُرَ means "to be many," while Form VI تَكَاثَرَ means "to compete with each other in having more." Form VI always indicates reciprocal/mutual action between multiple parties. One verse, two verb forms, a complete diagnosis: mutual competition *causes* distraction.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Delayed Subject for Impact">
The subject التَّكَاثُرُ is placed *after* the verb أَلْهَاكُمُ, not before it. Arabic allows flexible word order, and placing the subject after the verb (VSO order) is the default. But here the delay creates rhetorical impact: the listener hears "it distracted you" before learning *what* distracted them. The accusation (distraction) lands first; the cause (competition) is revealed second. This mimics the experience of distraction itself — you feel the effect before you recognize the cause.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence with the verb أَلْهَاكُمُ preceding its subject التَّكَاثُرُ. The verb agrees with its subject in gender (masculine) and number (singular — verbal nouns are grammatically singular). The attached pronoun كُمُ is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative, addressing the audience in second person plural. The damma on the final مُ of كُمُ is a linking vowel (حَرَكَة وَصْل) before the definite article.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَلْهَى is a Form IV verb from the defective root ل-ه-و (the final radical is a weak letter و). In the past tense, the weak final radical appears as alif maqsura: أَلْهَى. With the attached pronoun كُمْ, it becomes أَلْهَاكُمُ. التَّكَاثُرُ follows the تَفَاعُل pattern — the standard verbal noun (مَصْدَر) of Form VI. The root ك-ث-ر (to be many) produces كَثُرَ (Form I), كَاثَرَ (Form III, to compete in number), and تَكَاثَرَ (Form VI, mutual competition).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah opens without preamble — no oath, no address, just a blunt accusation. أَلْهَاكُمُ (past tense) presents the distraction as an established, completed fact — you have *already been* diverted. The directness is startling: the very first word is a verb of blame. Using كُمُ (you, plural) makes this collective — not one person's failing but a societal disease. التَّكَاثُرُ with the definite article indicates a well-known phenomenon — "that competition you all know about," the race for more wealth, more children, more status. The verse diagnoses a civilization's disease in two words.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="حَتَّىٰ زُرْتُمُ الْمَقَابِرَ"
  transliteration="ḥattā zurtumu l-maqābira"
  translation="Until you visit the graveyards"
  reference="At-Takathur 102:2"
  highlight="حَتَّىٰ,الْمَقَابِرَ"
  words={[{ ar: "حَتَّىٰ", tr: "ḥattā", en: "Until" }, { ar: "زُرْتُمُ", tr: "zurtumu", en: "You visited" }, { ar: "الْمَقَابِرَ", tr: "al-maqābira", en: "The graveyards/graves" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | حَتَّىٰ | ḥattā | - | Particle - preposition (limit/endpoint) | Not declinable (mabni) | Until |
| 2 | زُرْتُمُ | zurtumu | ز و ر | Verb - Form I, past, 2nd person masculine plural | Past verb (mabni), subject pronoun (tum) attached | You visited |
| 3 | الْمَقَابِرَ | al-maqābira | ق ب ر | Noun - feminine, plural, definite | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with fatha | The graveyards/graves |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="حَتَّى: The Particle of Limits">
حَتَّى marks an endpoint or limit — "until." It answers the question: "How long did the competition distract you?" Answer: "Until you reached the graves" — meaning until death. حَتَّى can function as a preposition (حَرْف جَرّ, taking genitive) or as a conjunction introducing a verb. Here it introduces the past tense verb زُرْتُمُ. The limit is absolute: the distraction of worldly competition consumed their *entire lives*, ending only when they entered the grave.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="زُرْتُمُ: Death as a 'Visit' — Devastating Euphemism">
زُرْتُمُ (you visited) from root ز-و-ر (to visit) is a profound euphemism. A visit (زِيَارَة) is temporary — you come and then leave. Calling death a "visit to the graves" implies one of two things: (1) death itself is temporary, and resurrection follows — the grave is not the final destination; or (2) ironically, those who competed for *permanence* in this world end up merely *visiting* the grave before the real accounting begins. Either reading is devastating: even death is not your end — judgment awaits.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** حَتَّى introduces a limit clause connected to verse 1. The full sentence reads: "Competition distracted you *until* you visited the graves." زُرْتُمُ is a past tense verb with the attached subject pronoun تُمُ (second person masculine plural). الْمَقَابِرَ is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative with fatha.

**Sarf (Morphology):** زُرْتُمُ is a Form I hollow verb from root ز-و-ر. The middle radical و drops in the past tense when consonant-initial suffixes attach: زَارَ → زُرْتُمُ. The internal passive-like vowel pattern (damma on ز) is characteristic of hollow verbs in this conjugation. الْمَقَابِرَ is the broken plural of مَقْبَرَة (graveyard), following the مَفَاعِل pattern — a common plural pattern for place nouns (مَفْعَلَة → مَفَاعِل).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The temporal progression is chilling. Verse 1 described a lifelong distraction; verse 2 reveals its endpoint: the grave. The euphemism زُرْتُمُ (visited) is deliberately understated — death, the most dramatic event in human existence, is reduced to a casual "visit." This understatement amplifies the horror. The broken plural الْمَقَابِرَ (graveyards, not a single grave) implies a collective fate — you all end up there, no matter how much you competed. The verse is only three words long, mirroring how quickly life ends after a lifetime of distraction.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ"
  transliteration="kallā sawfa taʿlamūna"
  translation="No! You are going to know"
  reference="At-Takathur 102:3"
  highlight="كَلَّا,سَوْفَ"
  words={[{ ar: "كَلَّا", tr: "kallā", en: "No! / Nay! / Stop!" }, { ar: "سَوْفَ", tr: "sawfa", en: "Will / going to" }, { ar: "تَعْلَمُونَ", tr: "taʿlamūna", en: "You will know" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | كَلَّا | kallā | - | Particle - negation/rebuke | Not declinable (mabni) | No! / Nay! / Stop! |
| 2 | سَوْفَ | sawfa | - | Particle - future tense marker | Not declinable (mabni) | Will / going to |
| 3 | تَعْلَمُونَ | taʿlamūna | ع ل م | Verb - Form I, present indicative, 2nd person masculine plural | Present indicative (marfu') with una ending | You will know |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="كَلَّا: The Particle of Rebuke and Rejection">
كَلَّا is a uniquely Quranic particle of strong negation and rebuke — it appears 33 times in the Quran and only in Meccan surahs. It serves two functions: (1) نَفِي وَرَدْع (negation and deterrence) — rejecting what came before, and (2) حَقًّا (truly) — affirming what follows. Here both apply: it rejects the distraction of verse 1 ("Stop this behavior!") and affirms the warning that follows ("Truly, you will know"). كَلَّا is indeclinable (مَبْنِي) and never changes form.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="سَوْفَ vs. سَـ: Degrees of Future">
سَوْفَ is a future tense marker that indicates a more distant or certain future compared to the prefix سَـ. سَوْفَ + present tense = "you will [definitely, eventually] know." The full word سَوْفَ (rather than the shortened prefix سَـ) adds weight and gravity — this is not a casual prediction but a solemn warning. The object of تَعْلَمُونَ is deliberately omitted: "you will know [something terrible]." The unspecified object creates dread — what they will know is too terrible to name.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** كَلَّا is syntactically independent — it connects to the preceding verses as a rejection but is not grammatically part of the following sentence. سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ is a verbal sentence: سَوْفَ is a future particle, and تَعْلَمُونَ is a present tense verb in the indicative mood (مَرْفُوع) with the نُون as the sign of indicative in the five verbs (الأَفْعَال الخَمْسَة). The subject is the attached pronoun واو.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَعْلَمُونَ is a Form I present tense verb from root ع-ل-م (to know). The second person masculine plural pattern is تَفْعَلُونَ. When preceded by سَوْفَ, the present tense takes future meaning. The verb retains its indicative mood (مَرْفُوع) because سَوْفَ does not affect verb mood (unlike لَنْ, which causes the subjunctive).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The brevity is terrifying — just three words deliver a complete threat. كَلَّا shatters the complacency of the competition-obsessed. سَوْفَ stretches the warning into the future, making the listener anticipate something dreadful without knowing exactly what. The omitted object of تَعْلَمُونَ is the most powerful element: what they will know is left to the imagination, and imagination creates more fear than specifics. This is the first of four escalating warnings (verses 3-4-5-6), and its stripped-down simplicity sets the baseline that each subsequent verse will exceed.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ"
  transliteration="thumma kallā sawfa taʿlamūna"
  translation="Then no! You are going to know"
  reference="At-Takathur 102:4"
  highlight="ثُمَّ"
  words={[{ ar: "ثُمَّ", tr: "thumma", en: "Then / Moreover" }, { ar: "كَلَّا", tr: "kallā", en: "No! / Nay!" }, { ar: "سَوْفَ", tr: "sawfa", en: "Will / going to" }, { ar: "تَعْلَمُونَ", tr: "taʿlamūna", en: "You will know" }]}

| 4 | تَعْلَمُونَ | taʿlamūna | ع ل م | Verb - Form I, present indicative, 2nd person masculine plural | Present indicative (marfu') | You will know |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="ثُمَّ for Escalation: 'Then' as Intensification">
ثُمَّ is a conjunction indicating sequence with an element of delay or contrast — stronger than فَ (immediate sequence) or وَ (simple conjunction). Adding ثُمَّ before repeating verse 3 serves as an intensifier: "Then, *moreover,* No!" Some scholars interpret the two warnings as referring to different stages: verse 3 warns of what they will know at death, verse 4 warns of what they will know at resurrection. Others see the repetition itself as the point — a double warning that leaves no room for doubt.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Identical to verse 3 except for the addition of ثُمَّ at the beginning. ثُمَّ is a conjunction (حَرْف عَطْف) that coordinates this sentence with the previous one. The sentence structure remains: كَلَّا (independent rebuke) + سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ (verbal sentence with future marker).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Identical to verse 3. No new morphological elements.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The near-exact repetition with only ثُمَّ added is a masterclass in rhetorical escalation. The first warning (verse 3) might be dismissed; the second (verse 4) cannot. ثُمَّ implies "and if that wasn't enough" — a second warning piled on top of the first. In oral recitation, the repetition creates a hammering rhythm: كَلَّا...كَلَّا — the rejection echoes. The escalation through repetition mirrors the very behavior being condemned: just as they competed for *more*, they now receive *more* warnings.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَلَّا لَوْ تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ"
  transliteration="kallā law taʿlamūna ʿilma l-yaqīni"

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | كَلَّا | kallā | - | Particle - negation/rebuke | Not declinable (mabni) | No! |
| 2 | لَوْ | law | - | Particle - conditional (contrary to fact) | Not declinable (mabni) | If / if only |
| 3 | تَعْلَمُونَ | taʿlamūna | ع ل م | Verb - Form I, present indicative, 2nd person masculine plural | Present indicative (marfu'), condition of law | You knew |

| 5 | الْيَقِينِ | al-yaqīni | ي ق ن | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) | The certainty |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="مَفْعُول مُطْلَق: عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ as Absolute Object">
عِلْمَ is a مَفْعُول مُطْلَق (absolute object/cognate accusative) — a verbal noun from the same root as the verb it modifies. تَعْلَمُونَ (you know, from ع-ل-م) is intensified by عِلْمَ (knowledge, also from ع-ل-م). This construction means "to know with true knowing" or "to know with certainty." The absolute object emphasizes the *manner* or *quality* of the action: not just any knowing, but عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ — the knowledge of absolute certainty. This is one of Arabic grammar's most elegant tools for intensification.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="لَوْ: The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional">
لَوْ introduces a condition that is contrary to fact — "if you knew (but you don't)." Unlike إِذَا (when — implying certainty) or إِنْ (if — neutral possibility), لَوْ implies the condition is NOT met. The devastating implication: they do NOT possess عِلْم اليَقِين. The answer to this conditional (جَوَاب لَوْ) is deliberately deleted — "if you knew with certainty, [you would never compete for worldly things]." The omission forces the listener to supply the answer themselves: what would change if they truly knew?
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** كَلَّا is again an independent rebuke. لَوْ is a conditional particle (أَدَاة شَرْط) introducing a contrary-to-fact condition. تَعْلَمُونَ is the condition verb (فِعْل الشَّرْط). عِلْمَ is the absolute object (مَفْعُول مُطْلَق) in the accusative, intensifying the verb. الْيَقِينِ is the second part of an idafa with عِلْمَ. The answer to the conditional (جَوَاب لَوْ) is omitted for rhetorical effect.

**Sarf (Morphology):** عِلْمَ is the verbal noun (مَصْدَر) of عَلِمَ on the فِعْل pattern. الْيَقِينِ is from root ي-ق-ن on the فَعِيل pattern, meaning "certainty, conviction." The cognate pair عِلْم/تَعْلَمُونَ (both from ع-ل-م) creates the مَفْعُول مُطْلَق construction.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The third كَلَّا shifts the surah's direction. Verses 3-4 warned of what they *will* know; verse 5 addresses what they *don't* know now. لَوْ (if, contrary to fact) is the surah's most psychologically acute moment: it diagnoses the root cause of their distraction — they lack certain knowledge of the Hereafter. The deleted jawab (answer) is more powerful than any stated consequence: the listener's imagination fills the gap with their own fears. The phrase عِلْم اليَقِين introduces an epistemological framework: there are levels of certainty, and they haven't even reached the first one.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَتَرَوُنَّ الْجَحِيمَ"
  transliteration="la-tarawunna l-jaḥīma"

| 2 | تَرَوُنَّ | tarawunna | ر أ ي | Verb - Form I, present, 2nd person masculine plural + emphasis | Present indicative (marfu') with heavy nun emphasis | You will see (emphatically) |
| 3 | الْجَحِيمَ | al-jaḥīma | ج ح م | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) | The Hellfire |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="لَ + Emphatic نون: Double Emphasis on Certainty">
لَتَرَوُنَّ contains two layers of emphasis: (1) لَ prefix (لام التوكيد or لام القَسَم) adds oath-like certainty, and (2) the heavy emphatic nun (نون التوكيد الثقيلة, نَّ with shadda) attaches to the verb's end. Together they create absolute certainty: "You WILL, without any doubt, see." The emphatic nun causes the verb to become indeclinable (مَبْنِي عَلَى الفَتْح). The original form تَرَوْنَ (you see) loses its normal يَاء and نُون ending, becoming تَرَوُنَّ with the emphatic nun replacing the normal indicative marker.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This may function as the jawab (answer) to the لَوْ conditional in verse 5, or as an independent emphatic statement. لَتَرَوُنَّ is a present tense verb with the لَ of emphasis and the heavy emphatic نون. The verb is مَبْنِي (indeclinable) due to the emphatic nun. الْجَحِيمَ is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَرَوُنَّ is from the defective root ر-أ-ي (to see). The original present tense is تَرَوْنَ (second person masculine plural). When the heavy emphatic nun attaches, the weak final radical ي is affected: تَرَوْنَ → تَرَوُنَّ. الْجَحِيمَ is from root ج-ح-م on the فَعِيل pattern, meaning "intensely burning fire" — one of the proper names for Hell in the Quran.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ ("you will know") in verses 3-4 to لَتَرَوُنَّ ("you will see") in verse 6 is an escalation from knowledge to direct visual experience. Knowing is abstract; seeing is visceral. The double emphasis (لَ + نَّ) makes this the most forceful statement in the surah so far. Naming الْجَحِيمَ (Hellfire) directly — after the omitted objects in verses 3-5 — is like a curtain being pulled back: what they will "know" is now revealed as direct, visual confrontation with Hell.

<Callout type="tip" title="Epistemological Progression: عِلْم اليَقِين → عَيْن اليَقِين">
Islamic epistemology recognizes three ascending levels of certainty: (1) عِلْم اليَقِين (knowledge of certainty) — knowing fire burns because you were told; (2) عَيْن اليَقِين (eye of certainty) — seeing fire with your own eyes; (3) حَقّ اليَقِين (truth of certainty) — being burned by fire yourself. Verse 5 mentioned level 1 (عِلْم) as something they lack; verse 7 promises level 2 (عَيْن) as something they will experience. The progression within the surah mirrors the progression of certainty: from abstract knowledge to direct visual encounter.

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** ثُمَّ coordinates this sentence with verse 6, adding escalation. لَتَرَوُنَّهَا has the same لَ + emphatic نون structure as verse 6, with the added pronoun هَا (referring to الْجَحِيم, feminine) as the direct object. عَيْنَ الْيَقِينِ functions as either a مَفْعُول مُطْلَق (seeing with "eye-seeing") or a حَال/ظَرْف (adverbial modifier describing the manner of seeing).

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَرَوُنَّهَا adds the feminine singular pronoun هَا to the emphatic verb form. عَيْنَ is from root ع-ي-ن on the فَعْل pattern — literally "eye" but used here as a metaphorical term for direct perception. Combined in idafa with الْيَقِينِ (certainty), it creates a compound epistemological term.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Verse 7 intensifies verse 6 through two additions: ثُمَّ (moreover/then) and عَيْنَ الْيَقِينِ (with the eye of certainty). The pronoun هَا (it) replaces the explicit الْجَحِيمَ, creating familiarity — they already know what "it" is from verse 6. The epistemological terminology adds a philosophical dimension: this is not ordinary seeing but عَيْن اليَقِين — the unmediated, undeniable, visual confrontation with reality. They refused عِلْم اليَقِين (knowing through faith) in this life; they will receive عَيْن اليَقِين (seeing directly) in the next — but by then, it will be too late.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice: تُسْأَلُنَّ — The Unnamed Questioner">
تُسْأَلُنَّ is a passive voice (مَبْنِي لِلْمَجْهُول) construction. The active form would be يَسْأَلُكُمْ (He asks you) — but the agent is deliberately unstated. In Arabic grammar, the omitted agent (الفَاعِل المَحْذُوف) is understood from context: Allah. The passive voice here serves two purposes: (1) it emphasizes the *action* (being questioned) over the agent, making the questioning itself the focus; (2) it creates awe — the Questioner is too majestic to be named as a grammatical subject, leaving the listener to contemplate Who is asking.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="النَّعِيم: The Blessings That Demand Accounting">
النَّعِيم (pleasure, blessings, comfort) from root ن-ع-م on the فَعِيل pattern is comprehensive — it covers all forms of worldly blessings: health, wealth, food, drink, safety, family, even shade on a hot day. The definite article الـ makes it universal: ALL blessings, not just luxury or excess. This connects directly to verse 1: the تَكَاثُر (competition) was for النَّعِيم — and now they must account for every blessing they received and how they used it. The surah comes full circle: from distraction by blessings to questioning about those same blessings.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** ثُمَّ coordinates this final warning with verse 7. لَتُسْأَلُنَّ follows the same لَ + emphatic نون pattern as verses 6-7, but now with passive voice. The verb is مَبْنِي (indeclinable) due to the emphatic nun. يَوْمَئِذٍ is an adverb of time (ظَرْف زَمَان) in the accusative, composed of يَوْم (day) + إِذٍ (then/at that time) in idafa. عَنِ النَّعِيمِ is a prepositional phrase indicating what the questioning concerns.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تُسْأَلُنَّ is the passive of سَأَلَ (to ask, root س-أ-ل). The passive is formed by changing the vowel pattern: active تَسْأَلُونَ → passive تُسْأَلُونَ (damma on prefix, fatha on pre-final radical). With the emphatic nun: تُسْأَلُنَّ. يَوْمَئِذٍ is a compound word: يَوْم (day) + إِذٍ (then), with the tanwin on إِذٍ functioning as a substitute for the deleted clause it refers to ("the day when [all this occurs]"). النَّعِيمِ is from root ن-ع-م on the فَعِيل pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah's final verse delivers its most comprehensive warning. The escalation reaches its climax: from warning (verses 3-4) to seeing Hell (verses 6-7) to being *questioned* about blessings (verse 8). The passive voice عن النَّعِيمِ creates maximum gravity — you are not merely warned but *interrogated*. The word النَّعِيم creates a devastating irony: the very pleasures they competed for (التَّكَاثُرُ) become the subject of their interrogation. The surah began with distraction *by* blessings and ends with questioning *about* those same blessings — a perfect thematic circle that closes like a trap.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the three levels of emphasis used in this surah's warnings. Compare: (a) كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ (verses 3-4), (b) لَتَرَوُنَّ (verse 6), and (c) لَتُسْأَلُنَّ (verse 8). How does each level escalate in grammatical intensity?">

**(a) كَلَّا سَوْفَ تَعْلَمُونَ (verses 3-4) — Level 1: Moderate emphasis**
- كَلَّا provides the rebuke
- سَوْفَ indicates future certainty but uses the standard future marker
- تَعْلَمُونَ is in the normal indicative mood (مَرْفُوع) with its regular ending
- Emphasis tools: 1 (كَلَّا)
- Repeated twice for rhetorical doubling

**(b) لَتَرَوُنَّ (verse 6) — Level 2: Strong emphasis**
- لَ prefix (lam al-tawkid) adds oath-like certainty
- نَّ (heavy emphatic nun) adds absolute certainty
- The verb is now مَبْنِي (indeclinable), frozen in its emphatic form
- Emphasis tools: 2 (لَ + نَّ)
- Shifts from "knowing" to "seeing" — more visceral

**(c) لَتُسْأَلُنَّ (verse 8) — Level 3: Maximum emphasis**
- Same لَ + نَّ double emphasis as (b)
- PLUS passive voice — adding the weight of an unnamed, awe-inspiring Questioner
- Emphasis tools: 3 (لَ + نَّ + passive)
- Shifts from "seeing" to "being interrogated" — most confrontational

**Escalation summary:**
Simple future warning → double-emphatic seeing → double-emphatic passive interrogation. Each level adds a grammatical tool and a more intense mode of experience (knowing → seeing → being questioned).

<ExerciseBox question="Explain the مَفْعُول مُطْلَق (absolute object) construction in verse 5: تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ. What is the relationship between the verb and its absolute object? Why does this construction intensify meaning? Provide another Quranic example.">

**The construction:**
- **Verb:** تَعْلَمُونَ (you know) — from root ع-ل-م
- **Absolute object:** عِلْمَ (knowledge) — also from root ع-ل-م
- **Relationship:** The verbal noun (مَصْدَر) comes from the same root as the verb it modifies

**Why it intensifies:**
- The مَفْعُول مُطْلَق adds emphasis to the *manner* or *quality* of the action
- تَعْلَمُونَ alone = "you know"
- تَعْلَمُونَ عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ = "you know with the knowing of absolute certainty"
- The repetition of the root (ع-ل-م appearing in both verb and noun) creates a semantic echo that reinforces the meaning
- Adding الْيَقِينِ in idafa specifies *what kind* of knowing — certain knowing, not doubtful knowing

**Types of مَفْعُول مُطْلَق:**
1. **Emphasis (تَوْكِيد):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا — "I struck him a striking" (= I really struck him)
2. **Kind/type (نَوْع):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا — "I struck him a harsh striking"
3. **Number (عَدَد):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبَتَيْنِ — "I struck him two strikings"

Here عِلْمَ الْيَقِينِ is type 2 (specifying the kind of knowing).

**Another Quranic example:**
- وَكَلَّمَ اللَّهُ مُوسَى تَكْلِيمًا (An-Nisa 4:164) — "And Allah spoke to Musa with [real] speaking"
- The مَفْعُول مُطْلَق تَكْلِيمًا emphasizes that this was actual, direct speech — not metaphorical

<ExerciseBox question="Trace the surah's circular structure: how does verse 8 (عَنِ النَّعِيمِ) connect back to verse 1 (التَّكَاثُرُ)? Identify the key vocabulary link and explain the thematic irony.">

**The circular structure:**

**Verse 1:** أَلْهَاكُمُ **التَّكَاثُرُ** — "Competition in increase distracted you"
- The competition was FOR worldly blessings (النَّعِيم)
- The distraction was FROM preparing for the Hereafter

**Verse 8:** ثُمَّ لَتُسْأَلُنَّ يَوْمَئِذٍ عَنِ **النَّعِيمِ** — "Then you will be asked about pleasure/blessings"
- The questioning is ABOUT those same worldly blessings
- The accountability is ON the Day of Judgment

**The vocabulary link:**
- التَّكَاثُرُ (competing for MORE) connects to النَّعِيمِ (the blessings they competed for)
- The ROOT connection: ك-ث-ر (to be many/much) relates to ن-ع-م (blessings/comfort) — they wanted MORE blessings

**The thematic irony:**
1. They spent their lives competing for النَّعِيم (blessings)
2. They were so consumed by this pursuit that it أَلْهَاكُمُ (distracted them) from what matters
3. On Judgment Day, those very blessings become the subject of interrogation
4. What they chased becomes what they're charged with

**The trap closes:** The surah opens with the disease (distraction by blessings) and closes with the reckoning (questioning about those same blessings). The pursuer becomes the pursued — hunted by the very thing they hunted. The grammar reflects this circularity: the surah begins with an accusation (past tense — أَلْهَاكُمُ, it already happened) and ends with a promise (emphatic future — لَتُسْأَلُنَّ, it will certainly happen). Past guilt meets future accountability.
