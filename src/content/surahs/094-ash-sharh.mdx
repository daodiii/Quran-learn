| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ | Verbal (interrogative) | أَلَمْ + jussive verb | Rhetorical affirmation of heart's expansion |
| 2 | وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ | Verbal (past tense) | Past tense + عَنْ separation | Removal of the Prophet's burden |
| 3 | الَّذِي أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ | Relative clause | الَّذِي + Form IV verb | Description of the burden's weight |
| 4 | وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ | Verbal (past tense) | Past tense + لَكَ benefactive | Elevation of the Prophet's mention |
| 5 | فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا | Nominal (إِنَّ) | إِنَّ + مَعَ accompaniment | First promise: ease accompanies hardship |
| 6 | إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا | Nominal (إِنَّ) | Exact repetition for emphasis | Second promise: doubling the assurance |
| 7 | فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانصَبْ | Verbal (conditional) | إِذَا + فَ-imperative | Command to worship after finishing duties |
| 8 | وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَارْغَب | Verbal (imperative) | Fronted prepositional phrase | Direction of longing toward Allah alone |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Surah of Three Divine Blessings">
Ash-Sharh enumerates three blessings Allah bestowed on the Prophet, each using a different verb: نَشْرَحْ (We expanded — your heart), وَضَعْنَا (We removed — your burden), رَفَعْنَا (We raised — your mention). The first uses أَلَمْ + jussive to create a rhetorical question ("Did We not expand?"), while the second and third use straightforward past tense. This progression moves from rhetorical affirmation to direct statement — as if after the gentle question, Allah simply declares the remaining facts. The three verbs together trace a complete arc: internal relief (heart), removal of weight (burden), and external honor (reputation).

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ"
  transliteration="alam nashraḥ laka ṣadraka"
  translation="Have We not expanded for you your breast?"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:1"
  highlight="أَلَمْ,نَشْرَحْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَلَمْ | alam | - | Particle - interrogative + negation | Not declinable (mabni), jussive particle | Have not / Did not |
| 2 | نَشْرَحْ | nashraḥ | ش ر ح | Verb - Form I, present/jussive, 1st person plural | Jussive (majzum) by alam, subject pronoun (nahnu) implied | We expand |
| 3 | لَكَ | laka | - | Particle + pronoun - preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun in genitive place (mahall jarr) | For you |
| 4 | صَدْرَكَ | ṣadraka | ص د ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + pronoun | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub), attached pronoun in genitive | Your breast/chest |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="أَلَمْ: Interrogative Negation as Emphatic Affirmation">
أَلَمْ combines the interrogative hamza (أَ) with the negation particle لَمْ. Together they create a rhetorical question that expects "yes" as an answer: "Did We not expand?" means "We certainly did expand." This is far more powerful than a flat statement because it invites the listener to confirm the blessing themselves. لَمْ governs the following verb in the jussive mood (مَجْزُوم) — hence نَشْرَحْ ends with sukun instead of the usual damma (نَشْرَحُ).
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="صَدْر: The Breast as Seat of Understanding">
صَدْر (breast/chest) in Quranic Arabic metaphorically represents the heart, understanding, and spiritual capacity. "Expanding the breast" (شَرْح الصَدْر) means opening the heart to receive guidance, removing anxiety, and granting inner peace. This expression appears in other Quranic contexts: Musa asks Allah رَبِّ اشْرَحْ لِي صَدْرِي ("My Lord, expand for me my breast" — Taha 20:25). The metaphor works because the physical chest contains the heart, and emotional relief literally feels like chest expansion.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence introduced by the interrogative-negation compound أَلَمْ. The verb نَشْرَحْ is in the jussive mood (مَجْزُوم) because لَمْ is a jussive particle (حرف جزم). Its subject is the implied pronoun نَحْنُ (We — the royal/divine plural). لَكَ is a prepositional phrase functioning as an indirect object (benefactive), and صَدْرَكَ is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** نَشْرَحْ is a Form I present tense verb from root ش-ر-ح on the يَفْعَلُ pattern. The jussive is marked by sukun on the final consonant (نَشْرَحْ instead of نَشْرَحُ). صَدْرَكَ is from root ص-د-ر on the فَعْل pattern, with the second person masculine singular possessive pronoun ـكَ attached.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening the surah with a rhetorical question rather than a statement is deeply purposeful. The question form (أَلَمْ) gently reminds the Prophet of blessings he already knows, inviting gratitude rather than commanding it. Using the divine plural (نَحْنُ) emphasizes the majesty of the One who performed this expansion. The indirect object لَكَ (for you) is placed before the direct object صَدْرَكَ, emphasizing that the blessing was specifically *for him* — a personal, directed act of Divine care.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ"
  transliteration="wa-waḍaʿnā ʿanka wizraka"
  translation="And We removed from you your burden"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:2"
  highlight="وَضَعْنَا,وِزْرَكَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | And |
| 2 | وَضَعْنَا | waḍaʿnā | و ض ع | Verb - Form I, past, 1st person plural | Past verb (mabni), subject pronoun (na) in nominative place | We removed/placed down |
| 3 | عَنكَ | ʿanka | ع ن | Particle + pronoun - preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun in genitive place (mahall jarr) | From you |
| 4 | وِزْرَكَ | wizraka | و ز ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite + pronoun | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub), attached pronoun in genitive | Your burden |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="عَنْ: The Preposition of Separation">
عَنْ indicates separation, removal, or source — "away from." Combined with وَضَعَ (to put down), it creates a vivid image: the burden was literally "put down away from" the Prophet. Compare with other prepositions: وَضَعَ فِي (to place in), وَضَعَ عَلَى (to place upon). The choice of عَنْ specifically conveys relief and distance — the burden is not just set aside but removed *from* him entirely.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence coordinated with verse 1 by the conjunction وَ. The verb وَضَعْنَا is past tense (فِعْل مَاضِ), indeclinable (مَبْنِي), with the attached pronoun نَا functioning as the subject in nominative position. عَنكَ is a prepositional phrase indicating source/separation. وِزْرَكَ is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** وَضَعْنَا is a Form I past tense verb from root و-ض-ع. Despite starting with و, this is not a weak verb — the واو is a radical letter. The pattern is فَعَلْنَا. وِزْرَكَ is from root و-ز-ر on the فِعْل pattern (with kasra), meaning burden or heavy sin. The possessive pronoun ـكَ makes it definite by attachment.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from rhetorical question (verse 1) to direct past-tense statement marks a change in tone — from gentle reminder to confident declaration. وَضَعَ (to put down) implies the burden was something the Prophet was carrying on his back, setting up the vivid image that verse 3 will elaborate. The word وِزْر connotes both physical weight and spiritual/emotional burden, allowing multiple layers of meaning: the anxiety of prophethood, the weight of responsibility, and the struggle of conveying revelation.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ"
  transliteration="alladhī anqaḍa ẓahraka"
  translation="Which had weighed upon your back"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:3"
  highlight="أَنقَضَ"
/>

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

| 1 | الَّذِي | alladhī | - | Relative pronoun - masculine, singular | Adjective (na't) describing wizraka - accusative place (mahall nasb) | Which/that which |
| 2 | أَنقَضَ | anqaḍa | ن ق ض | Verb - Form IV, past, 3rd person masculine singular | Past verb (mabni), relative clause verb | It weighed down/burdened |
| 3 | ظَهْرَكَ | ẓahraka | ظ ه ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite + pronoun | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub), attached pronoun in genitive | Your back |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IV أَنْقَضَ: Causative Intensity">
أَنقَضَ is a Form IV verb (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from root ن-ق-ض. The base meaning of نَقَضَ (Form I) is "to break, undo, dissolve." Form IV adds causative force: أَنقَضَ means "to cause to creak/crack under weight" — the burden was so heavy it made his back creak. This is an auditory metaphor: the listener can almost hear the sound of a back straining under impossible weight. Form IV's causative pattern is a reliable indicator across Arabic: عَلِمَ (knew) → أَعْلَمَ (informed); خَرَجَ (went out) → أَخْرَجَ (expelled).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّذِي is a relative pronoun (اسم موصول) functioning as an adjective (نَعْت) for وِزْرَكَ from verse 2, taking its case (accusative in position). The relative clause contains the verb أَنقَضَ with its implied subject (هُوَ, referring back to وِزْر) and the direct object ظَهْرَكَ (accusative). This three-verse unit (1-3) forms a single complex sentence.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَنقَضَ follows the Form IV pattern أَفْعَلَ from root ن-ق-ض. The prefixed hamza and the sukun on the first radical identify it as Form IV. ظَهْرَكَ is from root ظ-ه-ر on the فَعْل pattern. The ظ (ẓā') is an emphatic consonant, giving the word a heavier, more physical sound — appropriate for describing a back bending under weight.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The relative clause extends verse 2's metaphor into visceral physical imagery. Rather than simply saying "your heavy burden," the Quran adds that this burden أَنقَضَ ظَهْرَكَ — made your back crack under its weight. The onomatopoeia of نَقَضَ (the cracking sound) heightens the sensory experience. By describing the burden's effect before removing it (verse 2 states the removal, verse 3 describes what was removed), the Quran makes the reader appreciate the magnitude of the relief. You cannot appreciate what was lifted until you feel what was carried.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ"
  transliteration="wa-rafaʿnā laka dhikraka"
  translation="And We raised high for you your mention"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:4"
  highlight="رَفَعْنَا,ذِكْرَكَ"

| 3 | لَكَ | laka | - | Particle + pronoun - preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun in genitive place (mahall jarr) | For you |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Three Parallel Blessings: A Grammar Pattern">
Verses 1-4 enumerate three Divine blessings using parallel grammatical structures: (1) نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ (expanded your breast), (2) وَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ (removed your burden), (3) رَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ (raised your mention). Each follows the pattern: verb + preposition + pronoun + direct object with pronoun. The prepositions change meaningfully: لَكَ (for you — benefit), عَنكَ (from you — removal), لَكَ (for you — benefit again). The verbs trace a journey: internal expansion → external removal → upward elevation.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse mirrors the structure of verse 2 exactly: conjunction وَ + past tense verb + prepositional phrase لَكَ + direct object. رَفَعْنَا is the verb with attached subject pronoun نَا. لَكَ is a benefactive prepositional phrase. ذِكْرَكَ is the direct object in the accusative. The parallelism with verse 2 (وَضَعْنَا عَنكَ وِزْرَكَ / وَرَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ) creates a structural pair.

**Sarf (Morphology):** رَفَعْنَا is a Form I past tense verb from root ر-ف-ع (to raise, lift). ذِكْرَكَ is from root ذ-ك-ر on the فِعْل pattern — a verbal noun (masdar) meaning "mention, remembrance, reminder." The possessive ـكَ makes it "your mention" — how others speak of and remember the Prophet.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The third blessing is the most public and enduring. While the first two were internal/personal (heart expansion, burden removal), this one is external and eternal: رَفَعْنَا لَكَ ذِكْرَكَ — "We raised your mention." Scholars note this is fulfilled in the shahada (testimony of faith), the adhan (call to prayer), and every instance where Muhammad's name is mentioned alongside Allah's. The verb رَفَعَ (to raise) creates a physical opposite to وَضَعَ (to put down) in verse 2: as the burden went *down*, the reputation went *up*. The directional contrast — وَضَعْنَا عَنكَ (downward, away) versus رَفَعْنَا لَكَ (upward, toward) — is deliberate and beautiful.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَإِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا"
  transliteration="fa-inna maʿa l-ʿusri yusran"
  translation="For indeed, with hardship comes ease"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:5"
  highlight="إِنَّ,الْعُسْرِ,يُسْرًا"
/>

| 4 | الْعُسْرِ | al-ʿusri | ع س ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Object of preposition (majrur) after ma'a, genitive with kasra | The hardship |
| 5 | يُسْرًا | yusran | ي س ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) of inna - accusative (mansub) with tanwin | Ease |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="إِنَّ with Fronted Adverbial Predicate">
In this verse, إِنَّ has an unusual word order. Normally إِنَّ takes: ism (accusative) + khabar (nominative). Here, the prepositional phrase مَعَ الْعُسْرِ acts as a fronted khabar (خَبَر مُقَدَّم) placed before the ism. The actual ism of إِنَّ is يُسْرًا (accusative with tanwin fatha). Fronting the predicate emphasizes the accompaniment — the point is not just that ease exists, but that it exists *with* hardship, simultaneously, inseparably.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Definite العُسْر vs. Indefinite يُسْرًا: One Hardship, Many Eases">
Classical scholars note a crucial grammatical distinction: الْعُسْرِ (hardship) has the definite article الـ, while يُسْرًا (ease) is indefinite with tanwin. In Arabic grammar, a definite noun repeated refers to the *same* thing, while an indefinite noun repeated refers to *different* things. When verse 6 repeats الْعُسْرِ, it means "the same hardship." When it repeats يُسْرًا, it means "another ease." Result: one hardship is accompanied by two eases. As the scholars say: "One hardship can never overcome two eases" (لَنْ يَغْلِبَ عُسْرٌ يُسْرَيْنِ).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is a resultative conjunction connecting this verse to the preceding blessings — "because of all that, know this." إِنَّ governs the sentence: its ism is يُسْرًا (accusative with tanwin fatha), and its khabar is the prepositional phrase مَعَ الْعُسْرِ (fronted before the ism). مَعَ is an adverb of accompaniment (ظَرْف) that takes its noun in the genitive — hence الْعُسْرِ is genitive with kasra.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْعُسْرِ and يُسْرًا both follow the فُعْل pattern from their respective roots: ع-س-ر (difficulty) and ي-س-ر (ease). These two roots are semantic opposites, and their identical morphological pattern (فُعْل) makes them perfect rhetorical counterparts. The definite article on الْعُسْر contrasts with the tanwin on يُسْرًا — a morphological marker that carries theological meaning (see callout above).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The preposition مَعَ ("with") is theologically precise. It does not say بَعْدَ (after) — ease does not come *after* hardship but *with* it, simultaneously. This reframes suffering: even in the midst of hardship, ease is already present. The فَ prefix connects this universal law to the Prophet's personal experience in verses 1-4 — his specific story illustrates the general principle. Using إِنَّ adds emphatic certainty: this is not a hope but a cosmic guarantee.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ مَعَ الْعُسْرِ يُسْرًا"
  transliteration="inna maʿa l-ʿusri yusran"
  translation="Indeed, with hardship comes ease"
  reference="Ash-Sharh 94:6"

| 3 | الْعُسْرِ | al-ʿusri | ع س ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Object of preposition (majrur) after ma'a, genitive with kasra | The hardship |
| 4 | يُسْرًا | yusran | ي س ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) of inna - accusative (mansub) with tanwin | Ease |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Rhetorical Repetition: Exact Duplication for Emphasis">
Verse 6 repeats verse 5 almost exactly (dropping only the initial فَ). In Arabic rhetoric, exact repetition (تَكْرَار) of a full sentence is a powerful device indicating absolute certainty. The repetition is not redundancy — it is intensification. The first statement announces the principle; the second confirms it beyond all doubt. Combined with the definite/indefinite distinction (see verse 5), the repetition actually adds content: it guarantees a *second* ease alongside the *same* hardship.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Grammatically identical to verse 5 except for the absence of the initial فَ. إِنَّ again takes يُسْرًا as its ism (accusative) and مَعَ الْعُسْرِ as its fronted khabar. The sentence structure is exactly parallel: إِنَّ + fronted prepositional khabar + delayed ism.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Identical morphology to verse 5. الْعُسْرِ is definite (same hardship), يُسْرًا is indefinite (a new/different ease). The repetition of the identical forms creates a grammatical argument for "one hardship, two eases."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition embodies the very message it conveys — ease comes *again*. Just as the verse promises double ease, it delivers double assurance. The removal of فَ in verse 6 is subtle but significant: فَ connected verse 5 to the preceding blessings, making it a conclusion. Verse 6 stands independently as a universal principle, no longer tied to the Prophet's specific story. It becomes a timeless truth for all believers. The hadith tradition records the Prophet's response to these verses: "One hardship will never overcome two eases" — extracting the grammatical argument as theological comfort.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَإِذَا فَرَغْتَ فَانصَبْ"
  transliteration="fa-idhā faraghta fa-nṣab"
  translation="So when you have finished [your duties], then stand up [for worship]"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="إِذَا Conditional + فَ-Imperative: When X, Then Do Y">
This verse demonstrates a common Quranic pattern: إِذَا (temporal conditional) + past tense verb (protasis/condition) + فَ + imperative (apodosis/result). إِذَا differs from إِنْ: إِذَا implies certainty — "when this happens" (not "if"). The answer to the conditional is introduced by فَ because the apodosis begins with a non-verbal element (the imperative). This فَ is called فَاء الجَزَاء (the fa of result). The pattern appears throughout the Quran for practical commands tied to specific situations.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a conditional sentence (جُمْلَة شَرْطِيَّة). إِذَا is the conditional particle (أَدَاة الشَّرْط). فَرَغْتَ is the condition verb (فِعْل الشَّرْط) — past tense but with future meaning after إِذَا. فَانصَبْ is the answer to the condition (جَوَاب الشَّرْط), introduced by فَ because the apodosis is an imperative. The initial فَ connects this practical instruction to the theological principle of verses 5-6.

**Sarf (Morphology):** فَرَغْتَ is a Form I past tense verb from root ف-ر-غ (to be empty, to finish). The attached تَ is the second person masculine singular subject pronoun. انصَبْ is a Form I imperative from root ن-ص-ب (to erect, to exert, to stand upright). The imperative is formed by dropping the present-tense prefix and adding a helping hamza: يَنْصِبُ → انصَبْ. The sukun on the final letter marks the jussive-like form of the imperative.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After establishing the principle (ease with hardship) and enumerating blessings, the surah now gives a practical command: do not rest after finishing your worldly duties — instead, turn to worship. The verb فَرَغَ (to finish, become empty/free) implies that worldly tasks are temporary clearings of time, and the imperative انصَبْ (exert yourself) implies that worship requires effort and dedication. The brevity of the verse — just five words — mirrors the directness of the command: no elaboration needed, just do it.

### Verse 8

  arabic="وَإِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ فَارْغَب"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Fronted Prepositional Phrase: إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ Before the Verb">
Normally, the prepositional phrase would follow the verb: ارْغَب إِلَى رَبِّكَ (direct your longing toward your Lord). By fronting إِلَى رَبِّكَ before the verb, the Quran creates emphasis through a technique called تَقْدِيم (fronting). The effect is restriction (حَصْر): "To your Lord *exclusively* — and no one else — direct your longing." This fronting transforms a general command into an exclusive one. The same technique appears throughout the Quran: إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ (You alone we worship — Al-Fatiha 1:5) is another famous example.

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase إِلَى رَبِّكَ is fronted (مُقَدَّم) before the verb ارْغَب for emphasis and restriction. رَبِّكَ is genitive (مَجْرُور) after the preposition إِلَى, and the attached pronoun ـكَ is in genitive position (مُضَاف إِلَيْهِ). The فَ before ارْغَب is either a continuation of the conditional answer from verse 7 or an emphatic conjunction. ارْغَب is an imperative verb with an implied subject (أَنْتَ).

**Sarf (Morphology):** ارْغَب is a Form I imperative from root ر-غ-ب (to desire, to wish for). The verb رَغِبَ takes different prepositions with different meanings: رَغِبَ فِي (to desire something), رَغِبَ عَنْ (to be averse to something). Here with إِلَى, it means "to direct longing/desire toward." رَبِّكَ is from root ر-ب-ب, with the geminate second and third radicals merging in the فَعْل form. The idafa structure (رَبّ + كَ) makes it definite.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah closes by redirecting all the Prophet's energy toward Allah. After the blessings (verses 1-4), the principle (verses 5-6), and the first command (verse 7), this final verse reveals the ultimate purpose: all striving should be oriented toward the Lord. The fronted prepositional phrase makes this exclusive — not toward wealth, status, or people's approval, but إِلَى رَبِّكَ. Using رَبّ (Lord, Sustainer) rather than اللَّه (God) is intimate: رَبّ emphasizes the personal relationship of care and nurture. The two-imperative ending (انصَبْ/ارْغَب) creates a rhythmic pair: exert yourself, then direct that effort to your Lord.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the أَلَمْ construction in verse 1. Break it into its component particles, explain what mood it imposes on the verb, and describe how an interrogative negation creates an emphatic affirmation. Provide another Quranic example of this construction.">

**Component analysis:**
- **أَ** — interrogative hamza (حَرْف اسْتِفْهَام), introduces a question
- **لَمْ** — negation particle (حَرْف نَفِي وَجَزْم), negates past action and governs jussive mood

**Effect on the verb:**
- لَمْ requires the following verb to be in the jussive mood (مَجْزُوم)
- نَشْرَحُ (indicative, with damma) → نَشْرَحْ (jussive, with sukun)
- The jussive marker is the sukun on the final radical

**How interrogative negation creates affirmation:**
- "Did We not expand?" logically implies "We certainly did expand"
- Asking "Did X not happen?" assumes the listener knows it did happen
- This is more powerful than a flat statement because it invites the listener to confirm the fact themselves — turning them from a passive audience into an active participant in acknowledging the blessing

**Another Quranic example:**
- أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ (Al-Balad 90:8) — "Did We not make for him two eyes?" (We certainly did)

<ExerciseBox question="Verses 5-6 contain a famous grammatical argument about definite vs. indefinite nouns. Explain why الْعُسْرِ (with الـ) appearing twice means 'the same hardship,' while يُسْرًا (with tanwin) appearing twice means 'two different eases.' What is the broader Arabic grammar rule being applied?">

**The grammar rule:**
In Arabic, when a definite noun (with الـ) is repeated, it refers to the *same* entity both times. When an indefinite noun (with tanwin) is repeated, each instance refers to a *different* entity.

**Application to verses 5-6:**
- الْعُسْرِ (definite, with الـ) appears in both verses → refers to the **same** hardship both times
- يُسْرًا (indefinite, with tanwin fatha) appears in both verses → refers to **two different** instances of ease

**The conclusion:**
One hardship is accompanied by two eases. As the scholars summarize: لَنْ يَغْلِبَ عُسْرٌ يُسْرَيْنِ — "One hardship can never overcome two eases."

**The broader rule (قاعدة):**
- المَعْرِفَة إِذَا أُعِيدَتْ فَهِيَ هِيَ — "A definite noun, when repeated, is the same entity"
- النَّكِرَة إِذَا أُعِيدَتْ فَهِيَ غَيْرُهَا — "An indefinite noun, when repeated, is a different entity"

This rule appears in Arabic grammar textbooks (nahw) under the discussion of تَكْرَار (repetition) and applies broadly to Quranic exegesis, poetry, and legal texts.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the three Divine action verbs in verses 1-4: نَشْرَحْ, وَضَعْنَا, and رَفَعْنَا. For each, give its root, form, and the preposition used with it. Then explain the directional metaphor created by these three verbs together.">

**Verb 1: نَشْرَحْ (nashraḥ)**
- **Root:** ش-ر-ح | **Form:** I | **Preposition:** لَكَ (for you)
- **Meaning:** to expand, open up (the heart/breast)
- **Direction:** *outward* — expansion from inside

**Verb 2: وَضَعْنَا (waḍaʿnā)**
- **Root:** و-ض-ع | **Form:** I | **Preposition:** عَنكَ (from you)
- **Meaning:** to put down, remove (a burden)
- **Direction:** *downward and away* — removal of weight

**Verb 3: رَفَعْنَا (rafaʿnā)**
- **Root:** ر-ف-ع | **Form:** I | **Preposition:** لَكَ (for you)
- **Meaning:** to raise, elevate (reputation/mention)
- **Direction:** *upward* — elevation to heights

**The directional metaphor:**
The three verbs trace a complete arc of transformation: (1) the heart *opens outward*, creating space; (2) the burden *drops downward*, removing weight; (3) the reputation *rises upward*, gaining honor. Together they describe a person being liberated in every dimension — internally (heart), physically (burden), and socially (reputation). The preposition changes reinforce this: لَكَ (for you, benefit) → عَنكَ (away from you, removal) → لَكَ (for you, benefit again). The blessings begin and end with benefit (لَكَ), with the removal of harm (عَنكَ) sandwiched between.

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Rhetorical interrogative with أَلَمْ**: Interrogative hamza + negation particle creating emphatic affirmation — "Did We not?" means "We certainly did"
- **Jussive mood after لَمْ**: نَشْرَحْ shows sukun marking (instead of damma) because لَمْ governs the jussive
- **Three parallel Divine action verbs**: نَشْرَحْ, وَضَعْنَا, رَفَعْنَا — each with different prepositions (لَكَ, عَنكَ, لَكَ) creating directional metaphors
- **Form IV causative**: أَنقَضَ (caused to crack/break) from root ن-ق-ض — Form IV adds causative meaning
- **Relative clause with الَّذِي**: Verse 3 elaborates on the burden from verse 2 using a descriptive relative clause
- **إِنَّ with fronted khabar**: مَعَ الْعُسْرِ (predicate) placed before يُسْرًا (ism) for emphasis on accompaniment
- **Definite vs. indefinite repetition**: الْعُسْرِ (definite, same hardship) vs. يُسْرًا (indefinite, different ease each time) — grammatical argument for double ease
- **Exact verse repetition (تَكْرَار)**: Verse 6 repeats verse 5 for emphatic doubling of the promise
- **إِذَا conditional + فَ-imperative**: "When you finish, then exert yourself" — temporal condition with practical command
- **Fronted prepositional phrase (تَقْدِيم)**: إِلَى رَبِّكَ placed before ارْغَب for exclusivity — "To your Lord alone"
- **مَعَ (accompaniment) vs. بَعْدَ (sequence)**: مَعَ indicates simultaneous presence — ease is *with* hardship, not merely *after* it
- **Two closing imperatives**: انصَبْ (exert) and ارْغَب (direct longing) — practical application of the surah's theology
