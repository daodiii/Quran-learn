<Callout type="tip" title="The Surah of Three فُعَلَة Words">
Al-Humazah contains three words on the rare فُعَلَة pattern: هُمَزَة (scorner), لُمَزَة (mocker), and حُطَمَة (crusher). This pattern indicates intensity and habitual action — a person who does not merely slander once but is *defined* by slandering. Remarkably, the same pattern names both the sin (هُمَزَة/لُمَزَة) and its punishment (حُطَمَة). The grammar itself connects crime to consequence: the one who habitually crushes reputations will be crushed by the Crusher.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The فُعَلَة Pattern: Habitual Doer">
Both هُمَزَة and لُمَزَة follow the فُعَلَة pattern, which indicates someone who performs an action habitually and excessively. Compare with other patterns: فَاعِل (one who does) is neutral, while فَعُول and فَعَّال indicate intensity. The فُعَلَة pattern goes further — it defines the person by the action, as though slandering is their very identity. The ta marbuta (ة) at the end does not feminize the word; it functions as an intensifier.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="هَمْز vs. لَمْز: Front-face vs. Behind-back">
Classical scholars distinguish: هَمْز is slandering to someone's face (through gestures, mockery, or insults), while لَمْز is slandering behind someone's back (through gossip and backbiting). Pairing them condemns both forms comprehensively. Some scholars reverse the definitions, but all agree the pairing covers every type of character assassination.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence with وَيْلٌ as the mubtada (subject, nominative). The prepositional phrase لِكُلِّ هُمَزَةٍ لُمَزَةٍ functions as the khabar (predicate) — the woe is *directed at* every scorner. كُلِّ is the first part of an idafa with هُمَزَةٍ as the mudaf ilayh (genitive). لُمَزَةٍ is either an adjective (na't) or an apposition (badal) to هُمَزَةٍ, both requiring genitive case.

**Sarf (Morphology):** وَيْلٌ from root و-ي-ل on the فَعْل pattern is a quasi-masdar (verbal noun) used exclusively in exclamatory contexts. هُمَزَة from root ه-م-ز and لُمَزَة from root ل-م-ز both follow the فُعَلَة intensive pattern. The base verbs are هَمَزَ (to poke, prod, slander) and لَمَزَ (to wink, gesture mockingly, backbite). The assimilated لِّ (with shadda) shows the lam of the preposition merging with the lam of كُلِّ.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with وَيْلٌ — a word of cosmic condemnation — immediately arrests the listener. The indefinite form (tanwin) makes the woe limitless: not "a" woe but woe without measure. Using كُلِّ (every) universalizes the warning to anyone who practices this behavior. The rhyming pair هُمَزَة/لُمَزَة creates a phonetic echo that makes the condemnation memorable and rhythmic — a hallmark of early Meccan surahs.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي جَمَعَ مَالًا وَعَدَّدَهُ"
  transliteration="alladhī jamaʿa mālan wa-ʿaddadahu"

| 1 | الَّذِي | alladhī | - | Pronoun - relative, masculine singular | Adjective describing هُمَزَةٍ - genitive (majrur) | who, the one who |
| 2 | جَمَعَ | jamaʿa | ج م ع | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Predicate verb of relative clause - indicative | collected, gathered |
| 3 | مَالًا | mālan | م و ل | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with tanwin fatha | wealth, property |

| 5 | عَدَّدَهُ | ʿaddadahu | ع د د | Verb - Form II, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular + attached pronoun | Verb with attached object pronoun - verb indicative, pronoun accusative | counted it repeatedly |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form I vs. Form II: جَمَعَ vs. عَدَّدَ">
جَمَعَ (Form I: فَعَلَ) simply means "he collected." عَدَّدَ (Form II: فَعَّلَ, with doubled middle radical) means "he counted repeatedly/obsessively." Form II often adds intensity or repetition to the base meaning. The base verb عَدَّ means "to count," but Form II عَدَّدَ means "to keep counting over and over." This single morphological shift — doubling the middle letter — transforms a neutral action into an obsession.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّذِي is a relative pronoun (ism mawsul) functioning as an adjective to هُمَزَةٍ from verse 1, taking its case (genitive). The relative clause contains two coordinated verbal sentences: جَمَعَ مَالًا and عَدَّدَهُ. مَالًا is the direct object of جَمَعَ (accusative with tanwin fatha). The هُ pronoun on عَدَّدَ refers back to مَالًا.

**Sarf (Morphology):** جَمَعَ is a Form I verb from root ج-م-ع (to gather). عَدَّدَ is a Form II verb from root ع-د-د, identifiable by the doubled middle radical. The original root has identical second and third radicals (geminate root: ع-د-د), which causes the two dals to merge in pronunciation. The attached pronoun هُ (him/it) functions as the direct object of عَدَّدَ.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse provides the *defining characteristic* of the person condemned in verse 1 — the relative clause explains WHY they deserve woe. Using past tense (جَمَعَ, عَدَّدَ) rather than present tense presents these actions as established facts about this person's character. The indefinite مَالًا (wealth without the article) implies "any wealth, all kinds of wealth" — the greed is not specific. The shift from Form I (collecting) to Form II (obsessively counting) builds intensity: first he amasses, then he sits counting it over and over.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَحْسَبُ أَنَّ مَالَهُ أَخْلَدَهُ"
  transliteration="yaḥsabu anna mālahu akhladahu"
  translation="He thinks that his wealth will make him immortal"
  reference="Al-Humazah 104:3"
  highlight="أَنَّ,أَخْلَدَهُ"

| 1 | يَحْسَبُ | yaḥsabu | ح س ب | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Predicate verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') with damma | thinks, supposes |

| 3 | مَالَهُ | mālahu | م و ل | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + attached pronoun | Ism of anna - accusative (mansub) with fatha, + possessive pronoun genitive | his wealth |
| 4 | أَخْلَدَهُ | akhladahu | خ ل د | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular + attached pronoun | Khabar of anna - verbal sentence in nominative position, + object pronoun accusative | made him immortal |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="أَنَّ: The Subordinating Sister of إِنَّ">
أَنَّ functions identically to إِنَّ (governs accusative on its ism, nominative on its khabar) but is used in subordinate clauses — typically after verbs of thinking, knowing, saying, or believing. Here يَحْسَبُ (he thinks) requires أَنَّ (not إِنَّ) because the clause is the object of what he thinks. Think of إِنَّ as a main-clause emphasizer and أَنَّ as a subordinate-clause connector.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form IV Causative: أَخْلَدَ">
أَخْلَدَ is a Form IV verb (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from root خ-ل-د meaning "to be eternal." Form IV adds a causative meaning: خَلَدَ = "he was eternal" → أَخْلَدَ = "he made [someone] eternal." The irony is devastating: he thinks wealth causes immortality, but the next verse introduces the reality — eternal punishment, not eternal life.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَحْسَبُ is a verb of supposition (ظَنَّ and its sisters) that typically governs two objects. Here, instead of two direct objects, it takes a sentential complement introduced by أَنَّ. The entire أَنَّ clause (أَنَّ مَالَهُ أَخْلَدَهُ) occupies the position of both objects. Within the أَنَّ clause: مَالَهُ is the ism of anna (accusative) and أَخْلَدَهُ is a verbal sentence functioning as the khabar of anna.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَحْسَبُ is a Form I present tense verb from root ح-س-ب. It is among verbs where the middle radical can take either fatha or kasra in the present (يَحْسَبُ or يَحْسِبُ). أَخْلَدَ follows the Form IV pattern أَفْعَلَ from root خ-ل-د: the prefixed hamza and the sukun on the first radical are Form IV's hallmarks. The attached pronoun هُ on أَخْلَدَهُ refers to the slanderer himself, while هُ on مَالَهُ is possessive ("his wealth").

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The present tense يَحْسَبُ (he thinks) contrasts with the past tense أَخْلَدَ (made immortal). This unusual tense combination implies an ongoing delusion about a supposed completed achievement — he perpetually believes his wealth has *already* secured his immortality. The word يَحْسَبُ specifically means "to suppose without evidence," exposing the belief as groundless. The verse sets up the devastating كَلَّا (No!) that opens verse 4.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَلَّا ۖ لَيُنبَذَنَّ فِي الْحُطَمَةِ"
  transliteration="kallā la-yunbadhanna fī l-ḥuṭamah"
  translation="No! He will surely be thrown into the Crusher"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Triple Emphasis: لَ + Passive + Emphatic نَّ">
This verb packs three layers of emphasis into one word. (1) The لَ prefix (lam al-qasam/tawkid) adds oath-like certainty. (2) The passive voice (يُنبَذَ) removes the agent — the throwing is done by an unnamed, unstoppable force. (3) The heavy emphatic nun (نَّ with shadda) reinforces absolute certainty. Together they create: "He will *absolutely, certainly, inevitably* be thrown." The verb is mabni (indeclinable) because the emphatic nun freezes its ending.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** كَلَّا is a rebuke particle that negates everything preceding it — the slanderer's delusion of immortality. لَيُنبَذَنَّ is a present-tense passive verb with the emphatic لَ prefix and the heavy emphatic nun (نون التوكيد الثقيلة). When the emphatic nun attaches, the verb becomes mabni 'ala l-fath (built on fatha) and loses its normal i'rab. The prepositional phrase فِي الْحُطَمَةِ specifies the destination of the throwing.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُنبَذَنَّ comes from root ن-ب-ذ (to throw, discard). The passive voice is formed by changing the vowel pattern: active يَنْبِذُ → passive يُنْبَذُ (damma on prefix, fatha on pre-final radical). The heavy emphatic nun (نَّ) attaches directly to the verb stem, and the original damma ending is replaced by fatha. الْحُطَمَة follows the same فُعَلَة pattern as هُمَزَة and لُمَزَة, from root ح-ط-م (to crush, shatter).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** كَلَّا shatters the slanderer's fantasy mid-thought — a one-word demolition. The passive voice is deliberate: it deprives the slanderer of any dignity of knowing who punishes him, reducing him to an object being discarded. The word يُنبَذ (to throw/discard like trash) is particularly degrading — this is how the arrogant wealth-hoarder ends up. And الْحُطَمَة, sharing the same intensive pattern as his own titles (هُمَزَة/لُمَزَة), creates poetic justice through grammar: the crusher of reputations meets the Crusher of souls.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا الْحُطَمَةُ"
  transliteration="wa-mā adrāka mā l-ḥuṭamah"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ Formula">
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا is a recurring Quranic formula (also in 101:3, 82:17-18, 83:8, 90:12, etc.) used to introduce something beyond human comprehension. It contains two interrogative مَا pronouns: the first asks "what could possibly inform you?" and the second asks "what is X?" The formula always signals that the answer will be extraordinary. أَدْرَاكَ is Form IV from root د-ر-ك: دَرَكَ = "he perceived" → أَدْرَكَ = "he caused to perceive/made aware."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse contains two sentences. The first: مَا (interrogative, mubtada) + أَدْرَاكَ (verbal sentence as khabar). The second: مَا (interrogative, mubtada) + الْحُطَمَةُ (khabar, nominative with damma). The second مَا clause is the direct object (maf'ul bihi) of أَدْرَاكَ — "what made you know [what the Crusher is]." The ـكَ suffix on أَدْرَاكَ addresses the Prophet Muhammad directly.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَدْرَاكَ follows the Form IV pattern أَفْعَلَ from root د-ر-ك. The original form is أَدْرَكَ, but the alif-maqsurah appears as alif mamdudah in the past tense third person (أَدْرَى → أَدْرَاكَ with attached pronoun). The ـكَ is the second person masculine singular attached object pronoun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical question is unanswerable by design — no human could fathom al-Hutamah. By addressing the Prophet (ـكَ), the formula tells every listener: if even the Prophet needs to be told, how much more terrifying must it be? The repetition of الْحُطَمَة from verse 4 builds suspense before the answer in verse 6. This "question-then-answer" technique forces the listener to pause and contemplate before the revelation.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="نَارُ اللَّهِ الْمُوقَدَةُ"
  transliteration="nāru llāhi l-mūqadah"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Participle as Adjective: الْمُوقَدَةُ">
الْمُوقَدَةُ is a passive participle (ism maf'ul) from Form IV verb أَوْقَدَ (to kindle, ignite). The pattern is مُفْعَلَة (feminine of مُفْعَل). It functions as an adjective (na't) describing نَارُ and must agree in four ways: gender (feminine ة), number (singular), definiteness (definite with الـ, matching نَارُ which is definite by idafa), and case (nominative with damma). This four-way agreement is fundamental to Arabic adjective syntax.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse answers the question from verse 5. It is a nominal sentence with an implied mubtada (هِيَ — "it is") and نَارُ اللَّهِ as the khabar. نَارُ اللَّهِ forms an idafa: نَارُ is the mudaf (first element, nominative), and اللَّهِ is the mudaf ilayh (second element, genitive with kasra). الْمُوقَدَةُ is an adjective in the nominative case, agreeing with نَارُ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** نَارُ is from root ن-و-ر on the فَعْل pattern (with the weak middle radical و dropping). الْمُوقَدَةُ derives from Form IV verb أَوْقَدَ (root و-ق-د). The passive participle pattern for Form IV is مُفْعَل (مُوقَد), with the feminine ta marbuta added to match the feminine noun نَارُ.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Attributing the fire to Allah (نَارُ اللَّهِ) rather than simply saying "hellfire" is extraordinarily rare in the Quran — this is one of the very few instances. The idafa with Allah's name emphasizes that this fire is unlike any earthly fire: it belongs to and is sustained by the Almighty. الْمُوقَدَةُ (the kindled) in passive participle form implies an eternal state — it was kindled and remains kindled perpetually, with no need for fuel. The verse answers the impossible question with an even more overwhelming reality.

### Verse 7

<Callout type="tip" title="Form VIII Assimilation: تَطَّلِعُ">
تَطَّلِعُ appears to be Form V (تَفَعَّلَ), but it is actually Form VIII (اِفْتَعَلَ) from root ط-ل-ع. The original form is تَطْتَلِعُ (with the infixed ت of Form VIII after the first radical). However, when the first radical is ط (an emphatic letter), the infixed ت assimilates completely into the ط, producing تَطَّلِعُ with a shadda. This phonological rule — assimilation of the Form VIII ت with emphatic first radicals — also occurs with ض, ص, and ظ.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّتِي is the feminine singular relative pronoun, referring back to نَارُ (feminine). The relative clause تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الْأَفْئِدَةِ describes the fire's action. The verb تَطَّلِعُ takes the feminine prefix تَ to agree with its feminine subject (the fire). عَلَى الْأَفْئِدَةِ is a prepositional phrase indicating the target: "upon the hearts."

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَطَّلِعُ is a Form VIII (اِفْتَعَلَ) present tense from root ط-ل-ع. The Form VIII infix ت assimilates with the emphatic ط, yielding the doubled ط (with shadda). The base meaning of ط-ل-ع is "to rise, appear, ascend." Form VIII adds a reflexive nuance: "to rise of itself toward, to mount upon." الْأَفْئِدَةِ is the broken plural of فُؤَاد (heart), following the أَفْعِلَة pattern used for nouns of the فُعَال shape.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The fire does not merely burn skin — it تَطَّلِعُ عَلَى الْأَفْئِدَةِ, "mounts toward the hearts." The heart (فُؤَاد) in Quranic Arabic is the seat of consciousness, intention, and feeling. By targeting the hearts, the fire reaches the very source of the slanderer's malice and greed. There is a grim symmetry: the slanderer's diseased heart (which harbored contempt for others and love of wealth) becomes the precise target of divine punishment. The verb تَطَّلِعُ implies intelligent, purposeful movement — this fire *seeks out* hearts, it does not burn blindly.

<Callout type="rule" title="إِنَّ with Attached Pronoun + Indefinite Khabar">
إِنَّهَا has the pronoun هَا (it, referring to the fire) as the ism of إِنَّ (in accusative position). The khabar مُؤْصَدَةٌ is indefinite (with tanwin). This is grammatically valid because the ism is already definite (a pronoun), so the khabar does not need a definite article. The prepositional phrase عَلَيْهِم falls between ism and khabar, adding information about who is enclosed.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence introduced by إِنَّ. The ism of إِنَّ is the attached pronoun هَا (accusative, referring to the fire). The khabar of إِنَّ is مُؤْصَدَةٌ (nominative with tanwin damma). The prepositional phrase عَلَيْهِم is an adverbial complement (muta'alliq) positioned between ism and khabar for emphasis — the sealing is specifically *upon them*, with no escape.

**Sarf (Morphology):** مُؤْصَدَةٌ is a passive participle (ism maf'ul) from the verb أَوْصَدَ (Form IV from root أ-ص-د, meaning "to close, lock, seal"). The passive participle pattern for Form IV is مُفْعَل (مُؤْصَد), with ta marbuta for feminine agreement. Some reciters read it as مُوصَدَة (without hamza), from وَصَدَ (Form I). The pronoun هِم on عَلَيْهِم is third person masculine plural, referring back to the slanderers as a category.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** إِنَّ adds emphatic certainty: this sealing is a guaranteed fact. The passive participle مُؤْصَدَةٌ implies a permanent state — the fire is not merely closed but sealed shut, with no possibility of reopening. عَلَيْهِم ("upon them") makes the image claustrophobic: the fire is sealed *over* them, not just *around* them. This reverses the slanderer's worldly state — the one who hoarded wealth behind locked doors now finds himself locked behind doors of fire.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Broken Plural: عَمَدٍ from عَمُود">
عَمَدٍ is the broken plural of عَمُود (column, pillar). Broken plurals (جمع تكسير) do not follow a regular suffix pattern — instead, the internal vowel structure changes: عَمُود → عَمَد. This particular plural pattern (فَعَل from فَعُول) is common for nouns describing long objects. مُمَدَّدَة is feminine singular despite modifying a plural because non-human plurals in Arabic take feminine singular agreement — one of the most distinctive rules of Arabic grammar.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The prepositional phrase فِي عَمَدٍ مُمَدَّدَةٍ modifies مُؤْصَدَةٌ from verse 8 — describing *how* the fire is sealed: by means of extended pillars. عَمَدٍ is majrur (genitive) due to the preposition فِي. مُمَدَّدَةٍ is an adjective (na't) of عَمَدٍ, matching it in case (genitive), indefiniteness (tanwin), and — crucially — taking feminine singular form because عَمَدٍ is a non-human plural.

**Sarf (Morphology):** عَمَدٍ is a broken plural from root ع-م-د. The singular عَمُود follows the فَعُول pattern, and its plural عَمَد follows فَعَل. مُمَدَّدَةٍ is a passive participle from Form II verb مَدَّدَ (root م-د-د, "to extend, stretch"). The Form II passive participle pattern is مُفَعَّل (مُمَدَّد), with ta marbuta for the feminine singular agreement with the non-human plural.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends with an image of total confinement. The columns are مُمَدَّدَة — stretched out, extended indefinitely. This final word leaves the listener with a sense of endlessness: the punishment has no boundary, no limit. The surah began with a person who defined themselves by destroying others (هُمَزَة/لُمَزَة) and hoarding for themselves — and it ends with that person imprisoned in structures that extend forever. The indefinite forms (عَمَدٍ مُمَدَّدَةٍ, without الـ) amplify the boundlessness: columns beyond counting, extension beyond measure.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Find the three فُعَلَة-pattern words in this surah. For each, give its root, its base verb meaning, and explain how the فُعَلَة pattern changes the meaning from the base verb to an intensive/habitual noun.">

**1. هُمَزَة (humazah)**
- **Root:** ه-م-ز | **Base verb:** هَمَزَ = "to poke, prod, slander (to face)"
- **فُعَلَة meaning:** "One who habitually/compulsively slanders face-to-face" — the pattern transforms a single action into a defining character trait

**2. لُمَزَة (lumazah)**
- **Root:** ل-م-ز | **Base verb:** لَمَزَ = "to mock, gesture, backbite"
- **فُعَلَة meaning:** "One who habitually/compulsively mocks behind backs" — again, the pattern makes the action the person's identity

**3. حُطَمَة (hutamah)**
- **Root:** ح-ط-م | **Base verb:** حَطَمَ = "to crush, shatter, break"
- **فُعَلَة meaning:** "That which crushes habitually and completely" — when applied to hellfire, it means the fire that crushes everything it touches without ceasing

**The فُعَلَة pattern connection:** All three share the same morphological pattern, linking the slanderers (هُمَزَة/لُمَزَة) to their punishment (حُطَمَة). The grammar itself delivers the message: those who are defined by crushing reputations will meet what is defined by crushing souls.

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the verb يُنبَذَنَّ in verse 4: (a) identify its root and form, (b) explain the passive voice construction, (c) explain the emphatic nun, and (d) describe how the لَ prefix works with it. What is the combined rhetorical effect of all three emphatic elements?">

**(a) Root and Form:**
- **Root:** ن-ب-ذ | **Form:** I (فَعَلَ)
- **Active meaning:** نَبَذَ = "to throw away, discard, cast aside"

**(b) Passive Voice:**
- Active present: يَنْبِذُ (he throws) → Passive present: يُنْبَذُ (he is thrown)
- Formation: prefix vowel changes from فَتْحَة (يَ) to ضَمَّة (يُ), and the pre-final radical changes from كَسْرَة (بِ) to فَتْحَة (بَ)
- **Effect:** The doer is deliberately concealed — the slanderer is thrown by an overwhelming, unnamed force

**(c) Emphatic Nun (نون التوكيد الثقيلة):**
- The heavy emphatic nun (نَّ with shadda) attaches to the end of the verb
- It makes the verb مَبْنِي (indeclinable), built on fatha
- **Effect:** Adds absolute certainty — "he WILL be thrown, without any doubt"

**(d) The لَ Prefix (Lam al-Tawkid):**
- This is the لَ of emphasis/oath (connected to an implied oath by Allah)
- It combines with the emphatic nun as a pair: لَ...نَّ
- **Effect:** Oath-like force — "By Allah, he will certainly be thrown"

**Combined rhetorical effect:** Three layers of emphasis (لَ + passive + نَّ) create an irresistible, unstoppable decree. The slanderer who felt powerful mocking others is reduced to a passive, helpless object being discarded like refuse. No agency, no resistance, no escape — just absolute divine certainty of punishment.
