</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Final Word of the Quran">
An-Nas is the last surah of the Quran, and its final word is النَّاسِ — "mankind." The word appears 5 times in just 6 verses, each time with a different semantic role: the nurtured (v1), the governed (v2), the worshipped (v3), the targeted (v5), and the source of threat (v6). This single word carries the full range of humanity's relationship with both God and evil — making it one of the most concentrated displays of polysemy through context in the entire Quran.

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ | qul | ق و ل | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person masculine singular | Command verb (fi'l amr) - mabni on sukun | Say |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Isti'adhah Formula: أَعُوذُ بِـ...مِنْ">
The isti'adhah (seeking refuge) follows a precise grammatical formula: أَعُوذُ + بِ (source of protection) + مِنْ (source of threat). The preposition بِ marks the one in whom refuge is sought, while مِن (verse 4) marks what refuge is sought from. This two-preposition structure frames the entire surah: verses 1-3 define the Protector, verses 4-6 define the threat.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** قُلْ is an imperative verb (fi'l amr) whose hidden subject is أَنْتَ (you). The sentence أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ النَّاسِ is the مَقُول القَوْل (quoted speech) functioning as the object of قُلْ. The verb أَعُوذُ takes the preposition بِ to mark the one in whom refuge is sought. رَبِّ النَّاسِ is an idafah construction where رَبِّ is the mudaf (genitive because of بِ) and النَّاسِ is the mudaf ilayhi (genitive by idafah).

**Sarf (Morphology):** قُلْ demonstrates hollow verb behavior — the root is ق-و-ل but the middle radical و drops in the imperative, yielding the short form قُلْ. أَعُوذُ is from root ع-و-ذ on the pattern أَفْعُلُ (present tense Form I), where the middle radical و remains intact. The damma on the عين of أَعُوذُ follows the يَفْعُلُ present pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah opens identically to Al-Falaq (113:1) — قُلْ أَعُوذُ — pairing them as the Mu'awwidhatayn (the two surahs of refuge). But while Al-Falaq seeks refuge in رَبِّ الْفَلَقِ (Lord of the Daybreak), An-Nas uses رَبِّ النَّاسِ (Lord of Mankind). The shift from a cosmic phenomenon (daybreak) to humanity itself signals that this surah addresses an internal, intimate threat — one that targets the very hearts of human beings.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَلِكِ النَّاسِ"
  transliteration="maliki n-nas"
  translation="The King of mankind"
  reference="An-Nas 114:2"
  highlight="مَلِكِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | مَلِكِ | maliki | م ل ك | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Badal (apposition) to رَبِّ - genitive (majrur) with kasra | The King of |
| 2 | النَّاسِ | an-nasi | ن و س | Noun - masculine plural, definite | Mudaf ilayhi - genitive (majrur) with kasra | mankind |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Badal (Apposition): Why مَلِكِ Follows رَبِّ in Case">
مَلِكِ is not a separate idafah — it is بَدَل كُلّ مِن كُلّ (full substitutive apposition) to رَبِّ. The badal must match the مُبْدَل مِنه in grammatical case. Since رَبِّ is majrur (genitive due to بِ), مَلِكِ is also majrur. This is NOT genitive because of the preposition بِ directly — it inherits the case through apposition.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** مَلِكِ النَّاسِ stands as بَدَل to the preceding رَبِّ النَّاسِ. In badal constructions, the badal replaces the مُبْدَل مِنه in grammatical function — meaning مَلِكِ occupies the same syntactic position as رَبِّ. Both are governed by the preposition بِ, though indirectly for مَلِكِ. The idafah مَلِكِ النَّاسِ strips the tanwin and definite article from مَلِك.

**Sarf (Morphology):** مَلِك from root م-ل-ك on the فَعِل pattern is a sifah mushabbahah (quasi-adjective) denoting a permanent attribute. Note the distinction from مَالِك (active participle, فَاعِل pattern) — مَلِك suggests inherent kingship, while مَالِك would mean "one who possesses." The Quranic reading مَلِكِ (without long vowel) emphasizes sovereign authority.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The progression from رَبّ to مَلِك represents rhetorical escalation (taraqqi). رَبّ connotes nurturing care and sustaining — the intimate relationship of a lord to those he tends. مَلِك adds sovereign authority and absolute dominion. By naming Allah first as Nurturer then as King, the surah establishes that He both cares for and commands mankind — a being from whom protection is both lovingly offered and authoritatively guaranteed.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ"
  transliteration="ilahi n-nas"
  translation="The God of mankind"
  reference="An-Nas 114:3"
  highlight="إِلَٰهِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِلَٰهِ | ilahi | أ ل ه | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Badal (apposition) continuing chain - genitive (majrur) with kasra | The God of |
| 2 | النَّاسِ | an-nasi | ن و س | Noun - masculine plural, definite | Mudaf ilayhi - genitive (majrur) with kasra | mankind |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Triple Chain: رَبّ → مَلِك → إِلَٰه">
These three attributes form a carefully ordered progression: رَبّ (Lord/Sustainer — care), مَلِك (King — authority), إِلَٰه (God — worship). Each escalates the relationship: from one who nurtures you, to one who rules you, to the one you worship absolutely. The triple repetition of النَّاسِ with each attribute creates the surah's distinctive rhythmic pattern and ensures the listener understands that ALL three relationships belong to the same Being with respect to ALL of mankind.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِلَٰهِ النَّاسِ is the third and final badal in the chain. Some grammarians analyze إِلَٰهِ as badal to مَلِكِ rather than to the original رَبِّ — either analysis yields the same genitive case. The entire chain (رَبِّ / مَلِكِ / إِلَٰهِ) constitutes triple badal from a single governed noun, which is grammatically permissible when each badal elaborates on the same referent.

**Sarf (Morphology):** إِلَٰه from root أ-ل-ه on the pattern فِعَال carries the meaning of "the one worshipped" (المَعْبُود). The word is related to تَأَلُّه (to worship, to be devoted). The alif-lam in اللَّه is derived from الإِلَٰه with the hamza elided — making اللَّه literally "The God."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The climax of the triple chain is إِلَٰه — the relationship of exclusive worship. While رَبّ and مَلِك describe what Allah does for mankind (nurtures, governs), إِلَٰه describes what mankind owes Allah (worship). This reversal — from divine action toward humans to human obligation toward the divine — completes the theological framework before the surah transitions to the threat in verse 4. The triple repetition of النَّاسِ also creates a powerful phonetic anchor, making this surah one of the most memorized and recited passages in the Quran.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِن شَرِّ الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ"
  transliteration="min sharri l-waswasi l-khannas"
  translation="From the evil of the retreating whisperer"
  reference="An-Nas 114:4"
  highlight="الْوَسْوَاسِ,الْخَنَّاسِ"
/>

| 3 | الْوَسْوَاسِ | al-waswasi | و س و س | Noun - masculine singular, definite, intensive pattern | Mudaf ilayhi - genitive (majrur) with kasra | The whisperer (persistent) |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Two Types of Intensive Patterns: فَعْلَال vs. فَعَّال">
Arabic uses different morphological strategies to express intensity:

**الْوَسْوَاسِ (فَعْلَال)** — intensity through root reduplication. The root و-س is doubled to و-س-و-س, creating a quadriliteral that iconically mirrors the repetitive nature of whispering. This pattern associates with sounds and repeated motions (compare: زَلْزَال for earthquake).

**الْخَنَّاسِ (فَعَّال)** — intensity through gemination of the middle radical (نّ). This is a صِيغَة المُبَالَغَة (form of hyperbolic intensification), transforming the basic active participle خَانِس ("one who retreats") into "one who retreats habitually and excessively."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The preposition مِن completes the isti'adhah formula started in verse 1: أَعُوذُ بِ...مِنْ. شَرِّ is majrur by مِن and forms an idafah with الْوَسْوَاسِ. الْخَنَّاسِ is a na't (adjective) to الْوَسْوَاسِ, matching it in case (majrur), definiteness (definite with ال), gender (masculine), and number (singular) — fulfilling all four conditions of na't-man'ut agreement.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْوَسْوَاسِ derives from the quadriliteral root و-س-و-س through root reduplication, following the فَعْلَال pattern. This word can function as both a masdar (the act of whispering) and an agent noun (the whisperer) — the ambiguity is itself meaningful, as the entity is so defined by its action that agent and action merge. الْخَنَّاسِ from root خ-ن-س follows the فَعَّال pattern, one of the classic صِيَغ المُبَالَغَة expressing habitual or excessive action.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The two intensive patterns paint a complete behavioral profile: an entity defined by the cyclical act of whispering (فَعْلَال) who characteristically slinks away when confronted, only to return again (فَعَّال). The combination of root-reduplication intensity and gemination intensity creates a double layer of emphasis. The definite article الـ on both words makes them categorical — not just any whisperer, but THE Whisperer, a known and defined enemy.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ"
  transliteration="alladhi yuwaswisu fi suduri n-nas"
  translation="Who whispers in the hearts of mankind"
  reference="An-Nas 114:5"
  highlight="يُوَسْوِسُ,صُدُورِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

| 1 | الَّذِي | alladhi | - | Pronoun - relative, masculine singular | Na't (adjective) to al-waswas - genitive position (mahall jarr) | Who, that which |
| 2 | يُوَسْوِسُ | yuwaswisu | و س و س | Verb - quadriliteral Form I, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Fi'l mudari' - indicative (marfu') with damma | He whispers (persistently) |

| 5 | النَّاسِ | an-nasi | ن و س | Noun - masculine plural, definite | Mudaf ilayhi - genitive (majrur) with kasra | mankind |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="صُدُور: Why 'Breasts' Means 'Hearts'">
Arabic uses صَدْر (chest/breast) metaphorically for the inner self — the seat of thoughts, emotions, and intentions. The broken plural صُدُور follows the فُعُول pattern, one of the most productive broken plural patterns in Arabic. The choice of صُدُور over قُلُوب (hearts) is deliberate: the whisper enters through the outer layer (the chest) before reaching the core (the heart), describing the insidious, gradual nature of satanic suggestion.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّذِي is a relative pronoun (ism mawsul) referring to الْوَسْوَاسِ. The entire clause يُوَسْوِسُ فِي صُدُورِ النَّاسِ is the صِلَة الموصول (relative clause), which has no i'rab position of its own (لا مَحَلَّ لَها مِنَ الإِعْرَابِ). The relative pronoun الَّذِي itself is في محل جرّ as a na't to الْوَسْوَاسِ. صُدُورِ النَّاسِ forms an idafah: "the breasts/hearts of mankind."

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُوَسْوِسُ is the present tense of the quadriliteral verb وَسْوَسَ, following the pattern يُفَعْلِلُ. Quadriliteral verbs in Arabic are formed by doubling a biliteral root (و-س → و-س-و-س), and their present tense takes the يُـ prefix with kasra on the third radical. صُدُور is the broken plural of صَدْر on the فُعُول pattern — one of Arabic's most regular broken plural formations for فَعْل nouns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The present tense يُوَسْوِسُ (rather than past tense وَسْوَسَ) indicates ongoing, habitual action — the whispering is not a past event but a continuous present reality. This temporal immediacy creates urgency: the threat is happening now, which is why the refuge must be sought now. The fourth repetition of النَّاسِ identifies mankind as the target, the battlefield — the very hearts of human beings are where this unseen war takes place.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِنَ الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ"
  transliteration="mina l-jinnati wa n-nas"
  translation="From among the jinn and mankind"
  reference="An-Nas 114:6"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="مِنَ for بَيَان (Explanatory Clarification)">
The preposition مِنَ here serves a special function: بَيَان (clarification/specification). It is equivalent to أَيْ ("that is to say"), clarifying the identity of الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ: the whisperer comes from two categories — jinn and humans. This is the most widely accepted view among scholars, and it means the surah teaches that harmful whispering can come from both supernatural and human sources.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="الْجِنَّة vs. الْجَنَّة: One Vowel Changes Everything">
Be careful: **الْجِنَّةِ** (al-jinnati, kasra on jim) = "the jinn," while **الْجَنَّةِ** (al-jannati, fatha on jim) = "the garden/paradise." Both derive from root ج-ن-ن (to conceal), but their meanings diverge completely. The jinn are called so because they are concealed from human sight.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The preposition مِنَ here is used for البَيَان (clarification), specifying the identity of الْوَسْوَاسِ الْخَنَّاسِ from verse 4. The conjunction وَ performs عَطْف (coordination), making النَّاسِ معطوف على الْجِنَّةِ, therefore majrur by the same preposition مِنَ. The fatha on مِنَ (normally مِنْ with sukun) is due to التقاء الساكنين — the sukun of نْ and the sukun of لْ in الْجِنَّةِ cannot stand adjacent, so نْ receives a fatha.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْجِنَّة from root ج-ن-ن is a collective noun (ism jins jam'i) for the jinn species. The ta' marbuta is not for feminization but for collectivization. The doubled نّ in both الْجِنَّة and النَّاس creates a phonological echo, subtly linking the two categories at the level of sound.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah's final word is النَّاسِ — its fifth occurrence, creating a stunning inclusio (رَدّ العَجُز عَلَى المَطْلَع) where the last word echoes the first verse. But there is a devastating rhetorical twist: in verses 1-3, النَّاسِ represents humanity as the protected and the worshippers. In verse 5, they are the target. Now in verse 6, they are revealed as also being the source of the threat. Mankind is simultaneously the one seeking protection, the one being attacked, and the attacker. The pairing of الْجِنَّةِ وَالنَّاسِ also creates a deliberate contrast: the jinn are the hidden (from ج-ن-ن, to conceal), and mankind are the visible (from أ-ن-س, to be social/visible). Between hidden and visible, the whispering threat encompasses all creation.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="In verses 1-3, the words رَبِّ, مَلِكِ, and إِلَٰهِ all carry kasra (genitive case). Explain precisely why each word is majrur. Is the grammatical reason the same for all three, or does it differ?">

**رَبِّ** is مجرور because it is directly governed by the preposition **بِ** in بِرَبِّ. This is الجر بحرف الجر (genitive by preposition).

**مَلِكِ** and **إِلَٰهِ** are مجرور for a different reason: they are بَدَل كل من كل (full substitutive apposition) to رَبِّ. Since the مُبْدَل مِنه is مجرور, the بَدَل must follow it in case. They are NOT directly governed by the preposition بِ — their genitive case is inherited through apposition.

Additionally, all three words are مُضَاف to النَّاسِ, but being a مُضَاف does not itself cause the genitive case — it only strips the tanwin and definite article. The kasra comes from the preposition (for رَبِّ) and from apposition (for مَلِكِ and إِلَٰهِ).

If these words appeared as subjects in a nominal sentence, they would be مرفوع: **رَبُّ النَّاسِ مَلِكُ النَّاسِ إِلَٰهُ النَّاسِ** — with damma instead of kasra.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the morphological patterns of الْوَسْوَاسِ (فَعْلَال) and الْخَنَّاسِ (فَعَّال). Both express intensity, but through different mechanisms. Explain how each pattern creates its intensive meaning.">

The two patterns represent fundamentally different mechanisms of intensification:

**الْوَسْوَاسِ (فَعْلَال)** derives its intensity from **phonological reduplication** — the root و-س is repeated to form the quadriliteral و-س-و-س. This reduplication iconically mirrors the nature of whispering: repetitive, cyclical, echoing. The pattern فَعْلَال is associated with sounds and repeated motions (compare: زَلْزَال for earthquake from ز-ل-ز-ل). The word can function as either a مَصْدَر (the act of whispering) or an agent noun (the whisperer) — the ambiguity merges the entity with its action.

**الْخَنَّاسِ (فَعَّال)** derives its intensity from **morphological gemination** — the doubling of the middle radical (نّ) within the صِيغَة المُبَالَغَة. While the basic active participle خَانِس (فَاعِل pattern) means "one who retreats," the فَعَّال pattern transforms this into "one who retreats repeatedly, habitually, excessively, as a defining characteristic." Compare: كَذَّاب (habitual liar) vs. كَاذِب (one who lies).

Together, these patterns paint a complete behavioral profile: root-reduplication intensity (الْوَسْوَاسِ) for the cyclical action + gemination intensity (الْخَنَّاسِ) for the habitual retreat. The whisperer whispers relentlessly, then slinks away when God is remembered, only to return.
