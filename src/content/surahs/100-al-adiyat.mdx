# Al-'Adiyat (The Chargers)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 11
- **Theme:** A vivid depiction of war horses charging into battle as a metaphor for human ingratitude and obsession with worldly wealth. Contrasts the vigor horses show in serving their purpose with humanity's failure to be grateful to their Creator. Ends with a stark reminder of resurrection and divine knowledge.
- **Grammar Focus:** Oath constructions with wa-/fa- series, active participles (ism fā'il) as substantives, maf'ūl muṭlaq (مَفْعُول مُطْلَق), إِنَّ...لَـ double emphasis, jawāb al-qasam, أَفَلَا rhetorical question, passive verbs, nominal sentences.

<Callout type="tip" title="The Surah of Contrast: Loyal Horses vs. Ungrateful Humans">
Al-'Adiyat is structured as a dramatic contrast. Verses 1-5 paint a cinematic scene of war horses — panting, sparking, raiding, dust-raising, enemy-penetrating — displaying total dedication to their purpose. Then verse 6 delivers the jawāb al-qasam (answer to the oath) with a shocking pivot: إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ لِرَبِّهِۦ لَكَنُودٌۭ — "Indeed, mankind is ungrateful to his Lord." The implicit comparison: horses serve with vigor and loyalty; humans, given far more, respond with ingratitude. The four إِنَّ...لَـ constructions (verses 6, 7, 8, 11) hammer this point with relentless emphasis, while the أَفَلَا rhetorical question (verse 9) demands self-reflection.

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath | Not declinable (mabni), introduces oath | By |
| 2 | ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ | al-'ādiyāti | ع د و | Active participle - f.pl., definite | Object of oath (muqsam bihi) - genitive (majrūr) | The chargers/runners |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Oath Construction: وَ + Genitive Noun">
The oath particle وَ (by) is one of three oath particles in Arabic: وَ, بِ, and تَ. When وَ introduces an oath, the following noun must be in the genitive case (مَجْرُور). Here, ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ is genitive — its case marker is the kasra on the final تِ (the sound feminine plural genitive marker). The oath swears by the chargers to build gravity before delivering the point (jawāb al-qasam) in verse 6. This five-oath sequence (verses 1-5) is one of the longest oath introductions in the Quran.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Active Participles as Substantive Nouns">
ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ is the feminine plural active participle (اسم فاعل) from the verb عَدَا (to run/charge), following the فَاعِلَات pattern. Active participles frequently function as substantive nouns in the Quran — here it means "the [female] ones who run/charge," referring to war horses (Arabic uses feminine for groups of animals). The definite article الـ makes it a generic reference: all war horses that charge. Compare: ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ (v.2), ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ (v.3) — all active participles used as substantives.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَ is the oath particle (حَرْف قَسَم). ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ is the muqsam bihi (the object sworn by) in the genitive. ضَبْحًۭا is best analyzed as a maf'ūl muṭlaq (cognate accusative) describing the manner of the running — "charging with panting" — or alternatively as a ḥāl (state) in accusative: "while panting."

**Sarf (Morphology):** ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ is the sound feminine plural of the active participle عَادِيَة from root ع-د-و. The pattern is فَاعِلَة → فَاعِلَات. The root ع-د-و means "to run, charge, transgress." ضَبْح is a masdar from ض-ب-ح meaning the sound of heavy breathing/panting during exertion.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah opens with a cinematic image: horses charging at full gallop, their heavy breathing audible. The sound of the word ضَبْحًۭا itself — with the emphatic ض and the guttural ح — mimics the harsh panting of the horses. By swearing by these animals, the Quran elevates their dedication to a level worthy of divine oath. The listener is drawn into a battle scene before knowing why — the purpose (jawāb al-qasam) is withheld for five verses, building anticipation.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ قَدْحًۭا"
  transliteration="fa-l-mūriyāti qadḥan"
  translation="And those that strike sparks [with their hooves]"
  reference="Al-'Adiyat 100:2"
  highlight="ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ,قَدْحًۭا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni), connects oaths sequentially | And then |
| 2 | ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ | al-mūriyāti | و ر ي | Active participle - Form IV, f.pl., definite | Object of oath (muqsam bihi) - genitive (majrūr) | Those that strike sparks |
| 3 | قَدْحًۭا | qadḥan | ق د ح | Masdar - masculine, singular, indefinite | Absolute object (maf'ūl muṭlaq) - accusative (manṣūb) | Striking/sparking |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="فَ in Oath Sequences: Temporal Progression">
The فَ connecting verses 2-5 to the initial وَ oath is not a simple conjunction — it indicates temporal sequence (تَرْتِيب). The horses first charge (v.1), *then* strike sparks (v.2), *then* raid at dawn (v.3), *then* raise dust (v.4), *then* penetrate enemy ranks (v.5). Each فَ advances the action by one step, creating a cinematic sequence. This sequential فَ is distinct from the resultative فَ (فَاء السَّبَبِيَّة) and the resumptive فَ (فَاء الاسْتِئْنَافِيَّة).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ connects this oath to the previous one in temporal sequence. ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ is coordinated with ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ as another muqsam bihi in the genitive. قَدْحًۭا is the maf'ūl muṭlaq specifying the manner of the spark-striking.

**Sarf (Morphology):** ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ is the sound feminine plural of the Form IV active participle مُورِيَة from root و-ر-ي. Form IV أَوْرَى means "to strike fire, produce sparks." The مُـ prefix and kasra after the second radical identify it as a Form IV participle. قَدْح from root ق-د-ح means "striking, sparking" — originally used for striking a flint.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The image shifts from sound (panting) to sight (sparks). Iron-shod hooves striking rocky ground in darkness produce visible sparks — a terrifying visual detail of a night cavalry charge. The Form IV participle مُورِيَات (spark-producers) has causative force: the horses *cause* sparks to fly, making them active agents of destruction even before reaching the enemy. The progression from auditory (ضَبْحًۭا) to visual (قَدْحًۭا) imagery engages multiple senses.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ صُبْحًۭا"
  transliteration="fa-l-mughīrāti ṣubḥan"
  translation="And those that raid at dawn"
  reference="Al-'Adiyat 100:3"
  highlight="ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ,صُبْحًۭا"
/>

| 2 | ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ | al-mughīrāti | غ ي ر | Active participle - Form IV, f.pl., definite | Object of oath (muqsam bihi) - genitive (majrūr) | Those that raid |
| 3 | صُبْحًۭا | ṣubḥan | ص ب ح | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Adverb of time (ẓarf zamān) - accusative (manṣūb) | At dawn |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Dawn Raids: From Night Charge to Morning Attack">
صُبْحًۭا (at dawn) is a ẓarf zamān (adverb of time) in the accusative, telling us *when* the raid occurs. The sequence across verses 1-3 reconstructs a complete military operation: the horses charge through the night (v.1, panting), strike sparks in the darkness (v.2, hooves on stone), and arrive at the enemy camp at dawn (v.3, the surprise attack). Dawn raids (غَارَة الصُّبْح) were a standard Arab military tactic — attacking when the enemy is least alert. The Form IV participle مُغِيرَات from أَغَارَ (to raid) carries sudden, overwhelming force.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Third oath in the sequence, coordinated by فَ. ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ is the muqsam bihi in the genitive. صُبْحًۭا differs from ضَبْحًۭا and قَدْحًۭا — it is not a maf'ūl muṭlaq but a ẓarf zamān (adverb of time) in the accusative, answering "when?" rather than "how?"

**Sarf (Morphology):** ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ is the sound feminine plural of the Form IV active participle مُغِيرَة from root غ-ي-ر. Form IV أَغَارَ means "to raid, attack suddenly" (causative of غَارَ). صُبْح is from root ص-ب-ح on the فُعْل pattern, meaning "morning, dawn."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The third verse completes the night-to-dawn arc. The three participles form a tricolon: ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ (runners), ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ (spark-strikers), ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ (raiders) — escalating from general movement to specific military action. All three are Form IV or Form I participles functioning as substantive nouns, each describing the horses by a different attribute. This accumulation of descriptors builds a composite portrait of the war horse as the ideal servant — tireless, fearless, completely dedicated to its mission.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَثَرْنَ بِهِۦ نَقْعًۭا"
  transliteration="fa-atharna bihi naq'an"
  translation="And thereby raise up clouds of dust"

| 2 | أَثَرْنَ | atharna | أ ث ر | Verb - Form I, past, 3f.pl. | Past verb (mabni 'alā sukūn), nūn al-niswah = subject | They stirred up |

| 4 | نَقْعًۭا | naq'an | ن ق ع | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Direct object (maf'ūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb) | Dust cloud |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Shift from Participles to Finite Verbs">
Verses 1-3 used active participles (اسم فاعل) as oath nouns — static descriptions of the horses' attributes. Verses 4-5 shift to finite past-tense verbs (فِعْل مَاضِ) — dynamic narration of their actions. This grammatical shift reflects a shift in focus: from *what the horses are* (chargers, spark-strikers, raiders) to *what they do* (raise dust, penetrate ranks). The nūn al-niswah (نُون النِّسْوَة) in أَثَرْنَ marks the feminine plural subject — the horses themselves are performing the action.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ introduces the consequence of the charge. أَثَرْنَ is a past tense verb with the nūn al-niswah (نَ) as its subject pronoun (the feminine plural horses). بِهِۦ is a prepositional phrase — the pronoun هِ refers back to the raiding/charge context. نَقْعًۭا is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَثَرْنَ is Form I from root أ-ث-ر (to stir up, raise). The verb is مَبْنِي عَلَى السُّكُون (built on sukūn) because of the attached nūn al-niswah — a defining feature of 3rd person feminine plural past tense. نَقْع from root ن-ق-ع means "dust cloud" — specifically dust raised by galloping.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The scene expands from the horses themselves to their environmental impact — dust clouds billowing upward, obscuring the battlefield. The shift from participles to past-tense verbs creates a narrative feel: the listener is no longer observing attributes but witnessing events unfold. The past tense for future events (a common Quranic device) conveys certainty and vividness, as though the battle has already happened.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَوَسَطْنَ بِهِۦ جَمْعًا"
  transliteration="fa-wasaṭna bihi jam'an"
  translation="And penetrate thereby into the midst of the enemy"
  reference="Al-'Adiyat 100:5"
  highlight="وَسَطْنَ,جَمْعًا"

| 2 | وَسَطْنَ | wasaṭna | و س ط | Verb - Form I, past, 3f.pl. | Past verb (mabni 'alā sukūn), nūn al-niswah = subject | They penetrated the midst |

| 4 | جَمْعًا | jam'an | ج م ع | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Direct object or adverbial - accusative (manṣūb) | A gathering/army |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Climax of the Battle Scene">
وَسَطْنَ (they penetrated the center) brings the five-verse battle sequence to its climax. The verb وَسَطَ means "to be in the middle, to penetrate the center of" — the horses have not merely charged at the enemy but broken through to the heart of their formation. جَمْعًا (a gathering/army) is deliberately indefinite — it could be *any* army, making the image universal. The five-verse sequence traces a complete tactical arc: charge → sparks → dawn attack → dust → penetration. After this dramatic buildup, the jawāb al-qasam in verse 6 will deliver the surah's actual message.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Parallel structure to verse 4: فَ + past verb with nūn al-niswah + بِهِ + direct object/adverbial (manṣūb). وَسَطْنَ has the horses as its subject (the nūn al-niswah). جَمْعًا can be analyzed as either a direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ — they penetrated an army) or an adverbial of place (ظَرْف مَكَان — they penetrated into [the middle of] a gathering).

**Sarf (Morphology):** وَسَطْنَ is Form I from root و-س-ط (to be in the middle). The واو here is a radical letter, not a conjunction. جَمْع is from root ج-م-ع on the فَعْل pattern — a masdar meaning "gathering, collection, army."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The final oath-scene verse reaches peak intensity. The progression across five verses — sound (panting), light (sparks), time (dawn), earth (dust), and finally the human enemy (army) — builds through all sensory registers. وَسَطْنَ is particularly forceful: the horses don't just reach the enemy but *enter the center*, demonstrating total commitment. This image of complete self-sacrifice sets up the devastating contrast in verse 6: horses give everything, while humans — blessed with reason and guidance — give nothing back to their Lord.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ لِرَبِّهِۦ لَكَنُودٌۭ"
  transliteration="inna l-insāna li-rabbihi la-kanūdun"
  translation="Indeed, mankind is ungrateful to his Lord"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="إِنَّ...لَـ: Double Emphasis as Jawāb al-Qasam">
This verse is the jawāb al-qasam (answer to the oath) — the point of the entire five-verse buildup. It uses the most emphatic sentence structure in Arabic: إِنَّ (indeed) governing the subject + لَـ (surely) attached to the predicate. إِنَّ alone is emphatic; adding لَـ to the khabar doubles the emphasis. This إِنَّ...لَـ construction is specifically used as the answer to oaths (قَسَم), and it appears four times in this surah (verses 6, 7, 8, 11) — an extraordinary concentration of emphatic assertion, hammering the message of human ingratitude.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="كَنُود: The fa'ūl Pattern of Intensity">
كَنُود follows the فَعُول pattern (fa'ūl), which in Arabic indicates *intensive* meaning. Compare: صَبُور (very patient), شَكُور (deeply grateful), غَفُور (oft-forgiving). كَنُود means not merely "ungrateful" but *intensely, persistently ungrateful* — someone who recognizes blessings yet refuses to acknowledge them. This one word — placed as the climactic predicate after five verses of oath — carries the entire surah's message. The contrast is devastating: horses exhibit total loyalty; humans exhibit total ingratitude.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِنَّ governs the sentence: its ism is ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ (accusative), and its khabar is كَنُودٌ (nominative). The prepositional phrase لِرَبِّهِ is متعلق (connected) to كَنُود — specifying *toward whom* the ingratitude is directed. The لَـ before كَنُود is لَام المُزَحلَقَة (the sliding lām) — it originally belongs with إِنَّ but shifts to the khabar for phonological and emphatic reasons.

**Sarf (Morphology):** كَنُود is from root ك-ن-د on the فَعُول pattern. The فَعُول pattern is an intensive adjective form (صِيغَة مُبَالَغَة) — it doesn't just describe a quality but amplifies it. ٱلْإِنسَان from root أ-ن-س on the إِفْعَال pattern is used with the definite article for generic reference — all of mankind.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The jawāb al-qasam arrives with maximum impact. After five verses of vivid, fast-paced battle imagery, the surah suddenly stops and delivers a single, devastating statement about human nature. The shift from active battle scenes to a static nominal sentence (إِنَّ + noun) is itself rhetorical — the energy halts, and a truth is stated. The juxtaposition is the rhetorical device: horses, who have no intellect, serve with complete devotion; humans, who have both intellect and divine guidance, respond with ingratitude. The prepositional phrase لِرَبِّهِ ("to his Lord") makes the ingratitude personal — directed at the very One who created and sustains mankind.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Who is the Witness? Two Interpretations">
The pronoun هُ in إِنَّهُۥ can refer to either (1) الْإِنسَان (mankind) — he himself witnesses his own ingratitude through his actions, or (2) الله (Allah) — He is witness to mankind's ingratitude. Both readings are grammatically valid. The first interpretation (mankind as witness against himself) is more rhetorically powerful: a person's own behavior testifies to their ingratitude without needing an external judge. The second إِنَّ...لَـ construction reinforces the emphasis pattern established in verse 6.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَ coordinates this sentence with verse 6. إِنَّ takes the attached pronoun هُ as its ism (in the accusative place). عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ is a prepositional phrase متعلق (connected) to the khabar شَهِيدٌ. لَـ is the لَام المُزَحلَقَة attached to the khabar for double emphasis. شَهِيدٌ is the khabar of إِنَّ in the nominative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** شَهِيد from root ش-ه-د follows the فَعِيل pattern — which can function as an active participle (شَاهِد = witness) or passive participle (مَشْهُود = witnessed). Here it functions as an intensive active meaning: "a thorough/certain witness." ذَٰلِكَ is a demonstrative pronoun (اسم إشارة) for distant reference, pointing back to the ingratitude described in verse 6.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse compounds the indictment: not only is mankind ungrateful, but he *knows* it. The witness construction عَلَىٰ ذَٰلِكَ لَشَهِيدٌ implies that the evidence is so clear that even the accused must acknowledge it. If the pronoun refers to Allah, the meaning shifts to divine omniscience — ingratitude cannot be hidden. Either way, the verse eliminates the possibility of ignorance as an excuse. The second إِنَّ...لَـ maintains the emphatic pressure.

<Callout type="rule" title="لِ Causal + Iḍāfa: 'Because of Love of Wealth'">
The preposition لِ here indicates cause (سَبَبِيَّة) — "because of" or "due to." It governs the iḍāfa construction حُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ (love of wealth), where حُبّ is the muḍāf (genitive after لِ) and ٱلْخَيْر is the muḍāf ilayh (genitive). The full meaning: "he is intense *because of* his love of wealth" — explaining the root cause of human ingratitude. Note that ٱلْخَيْر literally means "the good" but in Quranic usage frequently means "wealth/property" (as in Surah Al-Baqarah 2:180).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Third إِنَّ...لَـ construction in sequence (verses 6, 7, 8). إِنَّ takes هُ as ism. The prepositional phrase لِحُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ is متعلق with شَدِيد, providing the cause or context. شَدِيدٌ is the khabar of إِنَّ (nominative). The iḍāfa حُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ has both terms in the genitive: حُبّ by the preposition لِ, ٱلْخَيْر by the iḍāfa relationship.

**Sarf (Morphology):** حُبّ from the geminate root ح-ب-ب on the فُعْل pattern is a masdar meaning "love." شَدِيد from root ش-د-د follows the فَعِيل pattern (intensive adjective) — "extremely intense/severe." ٱلْخَيْر from root خ-ي-ر on the فَعْل pattern literally means "good" but contextually means "wealth, property" — a common Quranic semantic shift.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse diagnoses the cause of human ingratitude: لِحُبِّ ٱلْخَيْرِ — because of love of wealth. The word ٱلْخَيْر ("the good") being used for "wealth" is itself an ironic commentary: humans call wealth "good" and pursue it obsessively, while true good (gratitude, worship) is neglected. The triple إِنَّ...لَـ sequence (v.6-7-8) creates a prosecutorial rhythm: charge (ungrateful), evidence (witness), motive (love of wealth). شَدِيد (intense) implies the love is not casual but consuming — it dominates the person's entire orientation.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="أَفَلَا: Triple-Particle Rhetorical Question">
أَفَلَا is a compound of three particles: أَ (interrogative hamza) + فَ (connective) + لَا (negation). Together they form a powerful rhetorical question expecting an affirmative answer: "Does he *not* know?" implies "He certainly should know!" The أَ creates the question, فَ connects it to the preceding argument (verses 6-8 about ingratitude), and لَا negates — but the negation within a question creates a double negative, which is emphatically positive. This triple-particle construction is a hallmark of Quranic rhetorical questioning.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** أَ introduces the rhetorical question. فَ connects it to the preceding indictment. لَا negates يَعْلَمُ. إِذَا introduces a temporal clause: "when" — with بُعْثِرَ as the passive condition verb. مَا is a relative pronoun functioning as the نَائِب الفَاعِل (deputy subject) of بُعْثِرَ. The prepositional phrase فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ is the صِلَة (relative clause complement) of مَا — "what [is] in the graves."

**Sarf (Morphology):** بُعْثِرَ is the passive of the quadriliteral verb بَعْثَرَ (to scatter, turn upside down, overturn). The quadriliteral passive pattern is فُعْلِلَ (like زُلْزِلَ in surah 99:1). ٱلْقُبُور is the broken plural of قَبْر (grave) on the فُعُول pattern — one of the most common broken plural patterns in Arabic.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the emphatic declarations (verses 6-8), the surah shifts to interrogation — the most direct form of engagement with the listener. أَفَلَا يَعْلَمُ demands: "After all this — the horses' dedication, your ingratitude, your obsession with wealth — do you *still* not realize what awaits?" The passive بُعْثِرَ (was scattered/overturned) is another quadriliteral verb (like زُلْزِلَ), and its passive conceals the agent (Allah) for majesty. مَا فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ ("what is in the graves") avoids naming the dead directly — referring to them as "contents" emphasizes that the graves will be emptied entirely, holding nothing back.

### Verse 10

<Callout type="rule" title="Parallel Passive Constructions: Graves and Hearts">
Verses 9-10 form a structural pair through parallel passive constructions: بُعْثِرَ مَا فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ (was scattered what is in the graves) / حُصِّلَ مَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ (was made manifest what is in the breasts). Both follow the pattern: passive verb + مَا + فِى + definite plural noun. The parallelism links two types of exposure: physical (bodies from graves) and spiritual (secrets from hearts). Nothing remains hidden — neither the dead nor the living's hidden intentions.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Coordinated with verse 9 by وَ. حُصِّلَ is passive with مَا as its نَائِب الفَاعِل. فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ is the relative clause complement of مَا (صِلَة الموصول). The entire verse 9-10 unit functions as the temporal clause governed by إِذَا: "when the graves are emptied and the hearts exposed."

**Sarf (Morphology):** حُصِّلَ is the passive of Form II حَصَّلَ (to gather, collect, make manifest) from root ح-ص-ل. Form II has the doubled middle radical (shadda on ص), and the passive is marked by ḍamma-kasra voweling: حُصِّلَ. ٱلصُّدُور is the broken plural of صَدْر (breast/chest) on the فُعُول pattern — the same word used in 94:1 (أَلَمْ نَشْرَحْ لَكَ صَدْرَكَ).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** ٱلصُّدُور (breasts/chests) is the Quranic metonym for the heart and its hidden contents — intentions, beliefs, secrets. The parallel between ٱلْقُبُور (graves) and ٱلصُّدُور (breasts) is not just structural but conceptual: graves hide the dead physically; breasts hide intentions spiritually. On Judgment Day, both are forced open. حُصِّلَ (made manifest/collected) implies that the hidden contents are not just revealed but sorted and categorized — each intention is identified, extracted, and presented as evidence. The shift from quadriliteral بُعْثِرَ (v.9) to Form II حُصِّلَ (v.10) moves from violent overturning to methodical extraction.

### Verse 11

<Callout type="rule" title="The Fourth إِنَّ...لَـ: Closing the Circle">
This is the fourth and final إِنَّ...لَـ construction in the surah, creating a frame of emphatic assertions: v.6 (mankind is ungrateful), v.7 (he is witness), v.8 (he is intense in love of wealth), v.11 (his Lord is fully Aware). The four statements form a complete argument: charge → evidence → motive → judge. The shift from هُ (he, singular — the individual) in verses 7-8 to هُم (them, plural — all mankind) in verse 11 expands the scope: what was a personal indictment becomes a universal judgment.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِنَّ governs رَبَّهُم as its ism (accusative). بِهِمْ is a prepositional phrase متعلق with the khabar خَبِيرٌ — specifying *about whom* Allah is aware. يَوْمَئِذٍ is an adverb of time (ظَرْف زَمَان) in the accusative, modifying the entire sentence. لَـ is the لَام المُزَحلَقَة attached to the khabar خَبِيرٌ. The sentence order is إِنَّ + ism + prepositional phrase + temporal adverb + لَـ + khabar.

**Sarf (Morphology):** خَبِير from root خ-ب-ر follows the فَعِيل pattern — an intensive adjective (صِيغَة مُبَالَغَة) meaning "thoroughly informed, deeply acquainted." This is one of Allah's names (الْخَبِير). رَبَّهُم uses the third person masculine plural pronoun هُم, shifting from the singular هُ in earlier verses. يَوْمَئِذٍ is the same compound seen in Surah 99:4 — يَوْم + إِذْ + compensatory tanwīn.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends where it must: with Allah. After cataloguing human failure (ingratitude, self-witnessing, wealth-obsession), the final verse declares that none of this escapes divine knowledge. خَبِير (All-Aware) is chosen over عَلِيم (All-Knowing) because خَبِير implies knowledge of *inner, hidden* realities — directly connecting to مَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ (what is in the breasts) from verse 10. The temporal marker يَوْمَئِذٍ (that Day) connects back to the إِذَا clause of verse 9 — "when the graves are emptied and the hearts exposed, *that Day*, their Lord is fully Aware of them." The surah comes full circle: it began with loyal horses and ends with an All-Knowing Lord — the first represents ideal servitude, the second represents ultimate authority.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify all four إِنَّ...لَـ constructions in this surah (verses 6, 7, 8, 11). For each, give the ism of إِنَّ (subject, accusative) and the khabar (predicate, nominative). Then explain why the surah uses this double-emphasis structure four times — what argumentative progression does it create?">

**The four إِنَّ...لَـ constructions:**

| Verse | Ism of إِنَّ (accusative) | Khabar (nominative) | Meaning |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------|---------|
| 6 | ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ (mankind) | كَنُودٌ (ungrateful) | Mankind is deeply ungrateful |
| 7 | هُ (he) | شَهِيدٌ (witness) | He himself witnesses it |
| 8 | هُ (he) | شَدِيدٌ (intense) | He is intense in love of wealth |
| 11 | رَبَّهُم (their Lord) | خَبِيرٌ (All-Aware) | Their Lord is fully Aware |

**Argumentative progression:**
The four statements form a prosecutorial sequence:
1. **Charge (v.6):** The accusation — mankind is ungrateful
2. **Evidence (v.7):** The proof — his own actions witness against him
3. **Motive (v.8):** The cause — obsessive love of wealth
4. **Judge (v.11):** The authority — Allah knows everything

This progression moves from accusation → evidence → explanation → divine judgment, creating a complete legal case. The shift from singular هُ (v.7-8) to plural هُم (v.11) expands the verdict from individual to universal.

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the five-oath sequence (verses 1-5). Identify the three active participles, explain how فَ creates temporal sequence, and describe the shift from participles (vv.1-3) to finite verbs (vv.4-5). What is the jawāb al-qasam (oath answer) and why is this contrast effective?">

**The three active participles (vv.1-3):**
1. ٱلْعَـٰدِيَـٰتِ (root ع-د-و, Form I فَاعِلَات) — the chargers/runners
2. ٱلْمُورِيَـٰتِ (root و-ر-ي, Form IV مُفْعِلَات) — the spark-strikers
3. ٱلْمُغِيرَٰتِ (root غ-ي-ر, Form IV مُفْعِلَات) — the raiders

**How فَ creates temporal sequence:**
فَ connects each oath in chronological order:
- First: horses charge through the night (panting)
- Then: hooves strike sparks on rocks (in darkness)
- Then: they arrive at dawn (surprise attack)
- Then: they raise dust clouds (during the charge)
- Then: they penetrate the enemy center (climax)

**Shift from participles to finite verbs:**
- Verses 1-3: Active participles (ism fā'il) — describe *attributes/characteristics* (what the horses ARE)
- Verses 4-5: Past tense verbs (fi'l māḍī) with nūn al-niswah — narrate *actions/events* (what the horses DO)

This shift moves from static description to dynamic narration, accelerating the pace.

**Jawāb al-qasam:**
إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَـٰنَ لِرَبِّهِۦ لَكَنُودٌۭ (verse 6) — "Indeed, mankind is ungrateful to his Lord."

**Why the contrast is effective:**
Horses — animals without intellect — display complete loyalty, dedication, and self-sacrifice. Humans — given reason, revelation, and countless blessings — respond with ingratitude. The five-verse buildup of equine heroism makes the single-verse indictment of human ingratitude devastating by comparison.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the parallel passive constructions in verses 9-10: بُعْثِرَ مَا فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ and حُصِّلَ مَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ. Identify each verb's root, form, and voice. Explain the grammatical role of مَا in each clause. Then describe the thematic parallel between 'graves' and 'breasts' and what it implies about Judgment Day.">

**Verse 9: بُعْثِرَ مَا فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ**
- **بُعْثِرَ** — Root: ب-ع-ث-ر (quadriliteral), passive of بَعْثَرَ (to scatter/overturn), pattern: فُعْلِلَ
- **مَا** — Relative pronoun functioning as نَائِب الفَاعِل (deputy subject) of the passive verb
- **فِى ٱلْقُبُورِ** — Prepositional phrase as صِلَة الموصول (relative clause complement): "what [is] in the graves"

**Verse 10: حُصِّلَ مَا فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ**
- **حُصِّلَ** — Root: ح-ص-ل (triliteral), passive of Form II حَصَّلَ (to collect/make manifest), pattern: فُعِّلَ
- **مَا** — Relative pronoun functioning as نَائِب الفَاعِل (deputy subject)
- **فِى ٱلصُّدُورِ** — Prepositional phrase as صِلَة الموصول: "what [is] in the breasts"

**The thematic parallel:**
- ٱلْقُبُور (graves) contain the physical — dead bodies, material remains
- ٱلصُّدُور (breasts/hearts) contain the spiritual — hidden intentions, beliefs, secrets
- On Judgment Day, both are forced open: graves yield up the dead for physical resurrection; hearts yield up their secrets for spiritual accounting
- The physical and spiritual are reunited: the resurrected body faces judgment based on the exposed intentions of its heart
- Nothing remains hidden — the parallelism teaches that Judgment Day is total: both outer (bodies) and inner (intentions) are fully exposed
