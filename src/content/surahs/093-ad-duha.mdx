## Grammar Summary

### Main Grammatical Constructs

1. **Oath constructions (qasam)**: Verses 1-2 use wa- oath particle with implied preposition governing genitive case

2. **Ma negation**: Verse 3 uses ma al-nāfiyah to negate past tense verbs (ma wadda'a, ma qalā)

3. **Emphasis particles**: La- used for emphasis in verses 4-5 (la-al-ākhiratu, la-sawfa)

4. **Future perfect with la-sawfa**: Verse 5 combines emphasis + future for strong assertion of future event

5. **Rhetorical questions**: Verse 6 uses a-lam (did not?) expecting affirmative answer

6. **Jussive mood**: Verse 6 (after lam), verses 9-10 (after la nahiy) show jussive verb forms

7. **Amma conditional construction**: Verses 9-11 use fa-amma... fa- pattern for conditional-directive clauses

8. **Parallel structures**: Verses 6-8 follow identical wajadaka... fa- pattern showing divine care

9. **Object complement (hal)**: Verses 6-8 use accusative nouns/participles (yatīman, dāllan, 'ā'ilan) describing object's state

10. **Idafa constructions**: Throughout surah, especially verse 11 (ni'mati rabbika)

11. **Imperative and prohibitive**: Verse 11 has positive command (haddith), verses 9-10 have negative commands (la taqhar, la tanhar)

### Pedagogical Notes

This surah is excellent for teaching:
- The emphatic la- particle and its effect on meaning
- The distinction between different negative particles (ma vs. la)
- Conditional constructions with amma
- Parallel syntactic structures for rhetorical effect
- The relationship between verb mood and meaning (jussive for prohibition/condition)
