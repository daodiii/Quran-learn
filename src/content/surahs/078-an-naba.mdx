### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1-5 | Questions & The Great News | عَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ | Interrogative openings, ism mawṣūl | Setting the theme through rhetorical questions |
| 6-16 | Signs of Allah's Power | أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ ٱلْأَرْضَ مِهَـٰدًا | أَلَمْ (interrogative negation), mafʿūl bihi series | Enumerating blessings as evidence |
| 17-20 | The Day of Judgment Described | إِنَّ يَوْمَ ٱلْفَصْلِ كَانَ مِيقَـٰتًا | Passive verbs (نُفِخَ، فُتِحَتْ، سُيِّرَتْ), كَانَ + khabar | Cosmic upheaval through passive constructions |
| 21-30 | Punishment of the Transgressors | إِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ كَانَتْ مِرْصَادًا | إِنَّ emphasis, ḥāl clauses, exception with إِلَّا | Intensifying punishment descriptions |
| 31-36 | Reward of the Righteous | إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا | إِنَّ + lām, tamyīz constructions | Contrasting bliss with prior torment |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Surah Architecture">
Surah An-Naba masterfully employs a tripartite rhetorical structure: interrogation (verses 1-5), evidence (verses 6-16), and consequence (verses 17-40). The opening هَلْ/أَلَمْ questions create suspense, the middle section uses systematic mafʿūl bihi constructions to catalog divine blessings, and the final sections deploy إِنَّ-fronted clauses to assert certainty about judgment. The shift from active voice (خَلَقْنَاكُمْ، جَعَلْنَا) in the blessings section to passive voice (نُفِخَ، فُتِحَتْ، سُيِّرَتْ) in the judgment section brilliantly conveys the transition from Allah's nurturing agency to the impersonal cosmic upheaval of the Last Day.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1


<ArabicExample
  arabic="عَمَّ يَتَسَاءَلُونَ"
  transliteration="ʿAmma yatasā'alūn"
  translation="About what are they asking one another?"
  reference="An-Naba 78:1"
  highlight="يَتَسَاءَلُونَ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | عَمَّ | 'amma | ع-ن-ي | Particle - 'an + ma (interrogative) | Preposition + interrogative pronoun - majrur (genitive) location | about what |
| 2 | يَتَسَاءَلُونَ | yatasaa'aluun | س-أ-ل | Verb - Form VI, present, 3rd person masculine plural | Verb - indicative (marfu'), plural subject pronoun attached | they ask one another |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse is an interrogative verbal sentence. 'Amma is a compound of the preposition 'an and the interrogative pronoun mā, which loses its final alif when preceded by a preposition. The verb yatasā'alūna is in the indicative (marfū') with the wāw al-jamā'a as the subject pronoun. The entire construction is a question about what topic occupies their mutual inquiry.

**Sarf (Morphology):** The verb yatasā'alūna follows the Form VI pattern (tafā'ala / yatafā'alu), which conveys reciprocal action -- they are asking one another, not simply asking. The root is s-'-l. The contraction of 'an + mā into 'amma is a standard phonological process in Arabic where the nūn assimilates into the following mīm.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening the surah with an interrogative creates immediate dramatic tension and engages the listener. The rhetorical question is not seeking information but expressing astonishment and rebuke at their heedless questioning. The Form VI reciprocal pattern emphasizes that the denial of the Hereafter was a widespread social phenomenon -- they were reinforcing each other's doubt, not merely wondering privately.

### Verse 2


<ArabicExample
  arabic="عَنِ النَّبَإِ الْعَظِيمِ"
  transliteration="ʿAnin-naba'il-ʿaẓīm"
  translation="About the Great News"
  reference="An-Naba 78:2"
  highlight="النَّبَإِ,الْعَظِيمِ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | عَنِ | 'ani | ع-ن-ي | Particle - preposition | Preposition governing genitive | about |
| 2 | النَّبَإِ | al-naba'i | ن-ب-أ | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Object of preposition (majrur bi-al-harf) - genitive case | the news/tidings |
| 3 | الْعَظِيمِ | al-'azhiimi | ع-ظ-م | Adjective - masculine singular, definite | Adjective (na't) - genitive, agrees with al-naba' | the great |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse is a prepositional phrase (jār wa-majrūr) that answers the question posed in verse 1. 'Ani is the preposition 'an with a kasra for phonetic liaison before the lām of the definite article. Al-naba'i is majrūr (genitive) as the object of the preposition. Al-'aẓīmi is a na't (adjective) that agrees with its described noun al-naba' in four respects: definiteness (both have al-), gender (masculine), number (singular), and case (genitive).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-naba' derives from the root n-b-' on the fa'al pattern, denoting news of great significance (more weighty than khabar). Al-'aẓīm follows the fa'īl adjectival pattern from the root '-ẓ-m, an intensive form indicating supreme greatness. The hamza at the end of naba' is part of the root and takes kasra in the genitive.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The delay of the answer to the question from verse 1 into verse 2 is a technique called tashjī' (building suspense). Rather than saying "'ammā yatasā'alūna 'ani l-naba'i l-'aẓīm" in one verse, the Quran splits it across two, forcing the listener to pause and anticipate. The adjective al-'aẓīm elevates the news from ordinary to momentous, preparing the audience for the gravity of what follows.

### Verse 3


<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي هُمْ فِيهِ مُخْتَلِفُونَ"
  transliteration="Alladhī hum fīhi mukhtalifūn"
  translation="That over which they are in disagreement"
  reference="An-Naba 78:3"
  highlight="الَّذِي,فِيهِ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | الَّذِي | alladhii | - | Relative pronoun - masculine singular | Relative pronoun describing al-naba' | which/that |
| 2 | هُمْ | hum | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person masculine plural | Subject (mubtada') - nominative | they |
| 3 | فِيهِ | fiihi | ف-ي-ي | Preposition + pronoun | Preposition + attached pronoun - genitive | in it/about it |
| 4 | مُخْتَلِفُونَ | mukhtaliifuun | خ-ل-ف | Active participle - Form VIII, masculine plural, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative, describes state | disagreeing/differing |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Alladhī is a relative pronoun (ism mawṣūl) functioning as a na't (adjective) for al-naba' from verse 2, or alternatively as a badal (appositive). The ṣilah (relative clause content) is the nominal sentence hum fīhi mukhtalifūn: hum is the mubtada' (subject, nominative), fīhi is a prepositional phrase serving as a modifier, and mukhtalifūna is the khabar (predicate, nominative with wāw as its case marker because it is a sound masculine plural).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Mukhtalifūna is a Form VIII (ifta'ala) active participle from the root kh-l-f. The Form VIII pattern here adds a reflexive/mutual dimension to the base meaning of "differing." The tā' infix after the first radical is the hallmark of Form VIII. As an active participle in the plural, it indicates an ongoing, habitual state rather than a one-time action.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Using a nominal sentence (jumla ismiyyah) for the relative clause rather than a verbal sentence emphasizes permanence and continuity -- their disagreement is not a passing event but an entrenched condition. The choice of fīhi ("in it/about it") rather than 'anhu ("about it") suggests they are immersed in their disagreement, surrounded by it. The active participle mukhtalifūn reinforces this as a defining characteristic of these people, not merely an action they perform.

### Verse 4


<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ"
  transliteration="Kallā sa-yaʿlamūn"
  translation="No! They are going to know"
  reference="An-Naba 78:4"
  highlight="كَلَّا,سَيَعْلَمُونَ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | كَلَّا | kallaa | - | Particle - negation/emphasis | Not declinable (mabni) - emphatic negation/warning | No! Certainly not! |
| 2 | سَيَعْلَمُونَ | saya'lamuun | ع-ل-م | Verb - Form I, future (sa-prefix), 3rd person masculine plural | Verb - indicative (marfu'), plural subject pronoun | they will know |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Kallā is an emphatic deterrent particle (ḥarf rad' wa-zajr) that is not declinable (mabnī). It functions to reject and rebuke the content of the preceding verses. Sa-ya'lamūna is a verbal sentence: the sa- prefix attaches to the present tense verb ya'lamūna to indicate the near future. The verb is marfū' (indicative) with the wāw al-jamā'a as the subject pronoun. The object of ya'lamūna is understood (they will know the truth of the Great News).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ya'lamūna is Form I (fa'ala / yaf'alu) from the root '-l-m. The sa- prefix is a particle that converts present tense to near future, contrasting with sawfa which indicates more distant future. Kallā itself has no root derivation -- it is an invariable particle unique to Quranic and elevated Arabic discourse.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Kallā delivers a sharp, abrupt rejection that breaks the questioning tone of verses 1-3. The shift from interrogative to declarative is jarring and intentional -- the conversation moves from "what are they asking?" to "No! They will know." The sa- prefix carries an implicit threat (wa'īd): the knowledge they will gain is not enlightenment but the terrifying realization on the Day of Judgment. The brevity of the verse adds to its force.

### Verse 5


<ArabicExample
  arabic="ثُمَّ كَلَّا سَيَعْلَمُونَ"
  transliteration="Thumma kallā sa-yaʿlamūn"
  translation="Then, no! They are going to know"
  reference="An-Naba 78:5"
  highlight="كَلَّا,سَيَعْلَمُونَ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | ثُمَّ | thumma | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - sequential conjunction | then |
| 2 | كَلَّا | kallaa | - | Particle - negation/emphasis | Not declinable (mabni) - emphatic negation/warning | No! Certainly not! |
| 3 | سَيَعْلَمُونَ | saya'lamuun | ع-ل-م | Verb - Form I, future, 3rd person masculine plural | Verb - indicative (marfu'), plural subject pronoun | they will know |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Thumma is a conjunction particle (ḥarf 'aṭf) that connects this sentence to verse 4, adding sequential emphasis. Unlike wa (which merely coordinates), thumma implies a pause and escalation. The remainder -- kallā sa-ya'lamūna -- is syntactically identical to verse 4: kallā as a deterrent particle followed by the future indicative verb with its subject pronoun.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Thumma is an invariable particle (mabnī 'alā l-fatḥ). No morphological change occurs in the repeated sa-ya'lamūna from verse 4. The repetition of the identical verbal form without any variation underscores that the morphology itself carries the rhetorical weight through doubling rather than modification.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition of kallā sa-ya'lamūna with thumma prefixed is a classical Arabic rhetorical device called takrīr (repetition for emphasis). Thumma here does not indicate temporal sequence ("then") but rather rhetorical escalation -- "furthermore, indeed!" The double warning intensifies the threat exponentially: the first states the warning, the second confirms that there is no escape from it. This structure mirrors oath formulas elsewhere in the Quran where repetition seals certainty.

### Verse 6


<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَلَمْ نَجْعَلِ الْأَرْضَ مِهَادًا"
  transliteration="Alam najʿalil-arḍa mihādā"
  translation="Have We not made the earth a resting place?"
  reference="An-Naba 78:6"
  highlight="أَلَمْ,نَجْعَلِ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | أَلَمْ | alam | - | Particle - interrogative + negative | Not declinable - interrogative negation (expects "yes") | have not / did not |
| 2 | نَجْعَلِ | naj'al | ج-ع-ل | Verb - Form I, present/jussive, 1st person plural | Verb - jussive (majzum) after lam | we make |
| 3 | الْأَرْضَ | al-ardha | أ-ر-ض | Noun - feminine singular, definite | First object (maf'ul bihi awwal) - accusative | the earth |
| 4 | مِهَادًا | mihaadan | م-ه-د | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Second object (maf'ul bihi thaanin) - accusative | a resting place/cradle |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A-lam is composed of the interrogative hamza (hamzat al-istifhām) and the jazm particle lam, which places the verb naj'al in the jussive mood (majzūm, marked by sukūn on the lām). The verb ja'ala here takes a double accusative: al-arḍa is the first maf'ūl bihi (accusative) and mihādan is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative), meaning "We made the earth [to be] a resting place." This double-object ja'ala construction governs the next several verses.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Naj'al is Form I (fa'ala / yaf'alu) from the root j-'-l. In the jussive after lam, the final short vowel is replaced by sukūn. Mihādan derives from the root m-h-d on the fi'āl pattern, a noun denoting a place of comfort, like a cradle or bed. The tanwīn on mihādan marks it as indefinite and accusative.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical question a-lam ("have We not...?") expects an affirmative answer and is far more powerful than a simple declarative statement. Rather than saying "We made the earth a resting place," the interrogative form compels the listener to acknowledge the blessing actively. This begins a sequence of eleven verses (6-16) that catalogue divine creative acts, building an overwhelming case for Allah's power before the judgment section begins.

### Verse 7


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالْجِبَالَ أَوْتَادًا"
  transliteration="Wal-jibāla awtādā"
  translation="And the mountains as stakes?"
  reference="An-Naba 78:7"
  highlight="وَالْجِبَالَ,أَوْتَادًا"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | الْجِبَالَ | al-jibaala | ج-б-ل | Noun - feminine/masculine plural, definite | First object (maf'ul bihi awwal) - accusative, parallel to al-ardha | the mountains |
| 3 | أَوْتَادًا | awtaadan | و-ت-د | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite | Second object (maf'ul bihi thaanin) - accusative | stakes/pegs |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse exhibits ḥadhf (ellipsis) -- the verb naj'al is omitted but understood from verse 6, making the full construction wa-[naj'al] al-jibāla awtādan. Al-jibāla is the first maf'ūl bihi (accusative) coordinated with al-arḍa via wa, and awtādan is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative). The coordinating conjunction wa connects this verse syntactically to the preceding a-lam question.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-jibāl is the broken plural of jabal (mountain) on the fi'āl pattern. Awtādan is the broken plural of watad (stake/peg) on the af'āl pattern from the root w-t-d. The plural form emphasizes multiplicity -- many mountains serving as many stakes anchoring the earth.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The metaphor of mountains as awtād (stakes/pegs) is a vivid tashbīh (simile without a comparison particle) that conveys stability and anchoring. Just as tent pegs hold a tent firm against wind, mountains stabilize the earth's crust. The ellipsis of the verb is itself rhetorically significant: it creates a rapid, list-like rhythm that accelerates the enumeration of divine blessings, drawing the listener forward through the catalogue.

### Verse 8


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَخَلَقْنَاكُمْ أَزْوَاجًا"
  transliteration="Wa khalaqnākum azwājā"
  translation="And We created you in pairs"
  reference="An-Naba 78:8"
  highlight="وَخَلَقْنَاكُمْ,أَزْوَاجًا"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | خَلَقْنَاكُمْ | khalaqnaakum | خ-ل-ق | Verb - Form I, past, 1st person plural + 2nd person plural object pronoun | Verb in past tense, -naa (subject), -kum (object) | We created you |
| 3 | أَزْوَاجًا | azwaajan |ز-و-ج | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite | Circumstantial qualifier (haal) - accusative | pairs/spouses |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verb shifts from ja'ala to khalaqa, taking a single direct object (-kum, attached pronoun in the accusative as maf'ūl bihi). Azwājan functions as ḥāl (circumstantial accusative), describing the state in which the creation occurred: "We created you [while being / as] pairs." The wa is a coordinating conjunction linking this to the preceding series. The pronoun -kum introduces direct second-person address where the previous verses used third-person constructions.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Khalaqnākum is Form I (fa'ala) from the root kh-l-q with the subject pronoun -nā (we) and object pronoun -kum (you, plural). Azwājan is the broken plural of zawj (pair/spouse/mate) on the af'āl pattern from the root z-w-j. The tanwīn marks it as indefinite and accusative.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from ja'ala to khalaqa is deliberate: ja'ala means to assign a function or quality to something, while khalaqa means to create from nothing. The pairing of humans is presented as a primordial creative act, not merely a functional arrangement. The shift to second-person address (-kum) personalizes the argument -- the listener is no longer hearing about abstract "them" but is directly confronted with evidence of divine creativity in their own existence.

### Verse 9


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَعَلْنَا نَوْمَكُمْ سُبَاتًا"
  transliteration="Wa jaʿalnā nawmakum subātā"
  translation="And We made your sleep a rest"
  reference="An-Naba 78:9"
  highlight="وَجَعَلْنَا,نَوْمَكُمْ"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | جَعَلْنَا | ja'alnaa | ج-ع-ل | Verb - Form I, past, 1st person plural | Verb in past tense with subject pronoun | We made |
| 3 | نَوْمَكُمْ | nawmakum | ن-و-م | Noun - masculine singular, with possessive pronoun | First object (maf'ul bihi awwal) - accusative + possessive -kum | your sleep |
| 4 | سُبَاتًا | subaatan | س-ب-ت | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Second object (maf'ul bihi thaanin) - accusative | a rest/repose |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse returns to the ja'ala + double accusative construction. Ja'alnā is the verb with the subject pronoun -nā. Nawmakum is the first maf'ūl bihi (accusative, with the possessive pronoun -kum) and subātan is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative), meaning "We made your sleep [to be] a rest." The possessive -kum continues the direct second-person address established in verse 8.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Nawm is a maṣdar (verbal noun) from the root n-w-m on the fa'l pattern, denoting the act/state of sleeping. Subātan derives from the root s-b-t on the fu'āl pattern, related to the concept of cutting off or ceasing activity -- the Sabbath (sabt) shares this root. The fu'āl pattern here conveys the manner or result of sleep: a state of cessation from exertion.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Sleep is not described merely as unconsciousness but as subāt -- a deliberate state of rest and recovery designed by Allah. The ja'ala construction emphasizes divine intentionality: sleep was made to serve a purpose, not left as an accidental biological function. By following creation of pairs (verse 8) with the blessing of sleep, the surah moves from the grand to the intimate, showing that Allah's care extends to the most personal daily experiences.

### Verse 10


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَعَلْنَا اللَّيْلَ لِبَاسًا"
  transliteration="Wa jaʿalnal-layla libāsā"
  translation="And We made the night as clothing"
  reference="An-Naba 78:10"

| 3 | اللَّيْلَ | al-layla | ل-ي-ل | Noun - masculine singular, definite | First object (maf'ul bihi awwal) - accusative | the night |
| 4 | لِبَاسًا | libaasan | ل-ب-س | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Second object (maf'ul bihi thaanin) - accusative | a covering/clothing |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The identical ja'ala + double accusative pattern continues: ja'alnā is the verb, al-layla is the first maf'ūl bihi (accusative, definite with al-), and libāsan is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative, indefinite with tanwīn). The definite-indefinite pairing (al-layla/libāsan) is characteristic of this construction where a known entity is assigned an attributed quality.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-layl derives from the root l-y-l and is a collective noun referring to nighttime in general. Libāsan comes from the root l-b-s on the fi'āl pattern, which typically denotes tools, instruments, or coverings. The root l-b-s means "to wear/cover," and the fi'āl nominal pattern produces a noun meaning "clothing, garment, covering."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Describing night as libās (clothing) is a powerful isti'āra (metaphor): night wraps around the world the way a garment wraps around a body, concealing, protecting, and providing warmth. The metaphor connects to the previous verse about sleep -- the night is the garment that accompanies the rest of sleep. This metaphorical naming (ja'ala + metaphorical predicate) elevates the description beyond literal function into poetic theology, showing that even darkness serves a merciful purpose.

### Verse 11


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَعَلْنَا النَّهَارَ مَعَاشًا"
  transliteration="Wa jaʿalnan-nahāra maʿāshā"
  translation="And We made the day for livelihood"

| 4 | مَعَاشًا | ma'ashan | ع-ي-ش | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar mimi | Second object (maf'ul bihi thaanin) - accusative | a livelihood/place of living |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The same ja'ala + double accusative construction continues for the third consecutive verse. Ja'alnā is the verb, al-nahāra is the first maf'ūl bihi (accusative, definite), and ma'āshan is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative, indefinite). The parallel structure with verse 10 (al-layla libāsan / al-nahāra ma'āshan) creates a perfectly balanced pair.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ma'āshan is a maṣdar mīmī (mīm-prefixed verbal noun) from the root '-y-sh on the maf'al pattern, which can denote a place, time, or instrument of living. The root means "to live/subsist," and the maf'al pattern yields "means of living, livelihood, place of sustenance." Al-nahār from the root n-h-r denotes the daytime period and is a collective noun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The night-day pair (verses 10-11) forms a tiqābul (antithetical parallelism): night is libās (garment for rest) while day is ma'āsh (livelihood for activity). This contrast highlights divine wisdom in the alternation of rest and work. The choice of ma'āshan rather than simply 'amalan (work) elevates the concept -- the day is not merely for labor but for living fully, for sustaining and flourishing. The pair completes a small ring within the larger catalogue of blessings.

### Verse 12

  arabic="وَبَنَيْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعًا شِدَادًا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verb shifts from ja'ala to banaynā (we built), introducing a new verb while maintaining the first-person plural divine voice. Fawqakum is a ẓarf makān (adverb of place, accusative) with the possessive pronoun -kum, specifying the location of the construction. Sab'an is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative, indefinite), and shidādan is its na't (adjective, accusative), both carrying tanwīn. The noun samāwāt (heavens) is understood but elided after the numeral.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Banaynā is Form I from the root b-n-y, a defective verb (nāqiṣ) where the final yā' appears in the past tense before -nā. Sab'an is a cardinal numeral. Shidādan is the broken plural of shadīd (strong/firm) on the fi'āl pattern, showing the fu'ul-to-fi'āl plural shift common with fa'īl adjectives.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from ja'ala (assigning function) to banā (constructing) elevates the imagery -- the heavens are not merely assigned a role but architecturally constructed with strength and permanence. The word shidādan (strong/firm) applied to the heavens contrasts strikingly with the later description of their being torn open on Judgment Day (verse 19), creating dramatic irony across the surah: what Allah built strong, He can also dismantle.

### Verse 13

  arabic="وَجَعَلْنَا سِرَاجًا وَهَّاجًا"
  transliteration="Wa jaʿalnā sirājan wahhājā"
  translation="And We made [therein] a burning lamp"

| 4 | وَهَّاجًا | wahhaajan | و-ه-ج | Adjective - Form I intensive (fa''aal), masculine singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - accusative, describes siraajan | blazing/burning brightly |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Ja'alnā returns as the governing verb. Here it takes a single maf'ūl bihi -- sirājan (accusative, indefinite) -- rather than the double accusative seen in previous verses. Wahhājan is a na't (adjective, accusative) describing sirāj. Some grammarians analyze this as an implicit double accusative with a hidden first object (the sun understood), but the simpler reading is that ja'ala here means "to create/place" with a single object and its modifier.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Sirājan derives from the root s-r-j on the fi'āl pattern, meaning a lamp or light source. Wahhājan comes from the root w-h-j on the fa''āl intensive pattern (also called ṣīghat al-mubālagha), which denotes extreme or habitual intensity of the quality. The doubled middle radical (hh) in wahhāj signals the intensive morphological pattern, indicating not just burning but blazing with fierce, continuous heat.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The sun is called sirāj (lamp) rather than shams (sun), employing isti'āra (metaphor) that presents the cosmos as a divinely designed dwelling -- the earth is a bed (mihād), the night is clothing (libās), and the sun is a lamp (sirāj). The intensive wahhāj adds sensory vividness: the listener can feel the blazing heat. This domestic-cosmic metaphor running through verses 6-16 makes the vast universe feel intimate and purposefully designed for human habitation.

### Verse 14


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَنزَلْنَا مِنَ الْمُعْصِرَاتِ مَاءً ثَجَّاجًا"
  transliteration="Wa anzalnā minal-muʿṣirāti mā'an thajjājā"

| 6 | ثَجَّاجًا | thajjaajan | ث-ج-ج | Adjective - Form I intensive (fa''aal), masculine singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - accusative, describes maa'an | pouring abundantly |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verb shifts to anzalnā (Form IV, we sent down), taking mā'an as the maf'ūl bihi (accusative). Min al-mu'ṣirāti is a prepositional phrase (jār wa-majrūr) indicating the source of the water. Thajjājan is a na't (adjective, accusative) modifying mā'an. The sentence structure is: verb + prepositional phrase (source) + object + adjective.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Anzalnā is Form IV (af'ala) from the root n-z-l, where the hamza prefix adds causative/transitive meaning: "to cause to descend, to send down." Al-mu'ṣirāt is the Form IV feminine active participle plural from the root '-ṣ-r (to press/squeeze), describing clouds that "press out" or "wring" their rain -- a vivid derivation. Thajjājan follows the fa''āl intensive pattern from the root th-j-j, denoting copious, continuous pouring.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verb choice anzala (to send down from above) rather than a neutral verb of giving reinforces the vertical cosmological imagery of the surah -- heavens above (verse 12), a lamp in the sky (verse 13), and now rain descending. Al-mu'ṣirāt personifies the clouds through the active participle: they are agents that "wring out" water, not passive vessels. Combined with the intensive thajjāj, the verse creates an image of powerful, purposeful abundance. This begins the rain-vegetation sequence (verses 14-16) showing the chain from sky to earth to sustenance.

### Verse 15


<ArabicExample
  arabic="لِّنُخْرِجَ بِهِ حَبًّا وَنَبَاتًا"
  transliteration="Li nukhrija bihī ḥabban wa nabātā"
  translation="That We may bring forth thereby grain and vegetation"

/>

| 5 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - coordinating conjunction | and |
| 6 | نَبَاتًا | nabaatan | ن-ب-ت | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative, coordinated with habban | vegetation/plants |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Li is lām al-ta'līl (the lām of purpose), which governs the subjunctive mood. Nukhrija is therefore manṣūb (subjunctive), marked by the fatḥa on the final jīm. Bihi is a prepositional phrase with the instrumental bā' (by means of it), where the pronoun refers back to mā' (water) from verse 14. Ḥabban and nabātan are both maf'ūl bihi (accusative objects of nukhrija), coordinated by wa.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Nukhrija is Form IV (uf'ilu / yukhriju) from the root kh-r-j, where the hamza prefix adds causative meaning: "to cause to come out, to bring forth." The base Form I kharaja means "to exit," and Form IV makes it transitive. Ḥabban (grain) from the root ḥ-b-b is a collective noun on the fa'l pattern. Nabātan (vegetation) from the root n-b-t is a maṣdar on the fa'āl pattern denoting the process and product of growth.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The purpose clause (li-nukhrija) explicitly links rain to vegetation, revealing the telos (purpose) behind each divine act. The surah does not merely catalogue blessings but shows their interconnection: rain exists for vegetation, vegetation for sustenance. Listing ḥabban (grain, the staple) before nabātan (vegetation, the general) moves from the specific essential to the broader category, emphasizing that human sustenance is the primary divine concern.

### Verse 16


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَنَّاتٍ أَلْفَافًا"
  transliteration="Wa jannātin alfāfā"
  translation="And gardens of entwined growth"
  reference="An-Naba 78:16"
  highlight="وَجَنَّاتٍ,أَلْفَافًا"
/>


#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| 2 | جَنَّاتٍ | jannaatin | ج-ن-ن | Noun - feminine plural, indefinite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative, coordinated with habban/nabaatan | gardens |
| 3 | أَلْفَافًا | alfaafan | ل-ف-ف | Adjective - plural, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - accusative/genitive, describes jannaatin | entwined/dense |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Jannātin is coordinated with ḥabban and nabātan from verse 15 via wa, serving as an additional maf'ūl bihi of nukhrija (accusative). As a sound feminine plural, its accusative case is marked by kasra (not fatḥa), which is the unique feature of this plural type: jannātin. Alfāfan is a na't (adjective, accusative) describing the gardens.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Jannāt is the sound feminine plural of janna (garden) from the root j-n-n, which carries the core meaning of concealment/covering -- a garden is a place concealed by abundant foliage. Alfāfan is the plural of liff or lufuf from the root l-f-f (to wrap, entwine), denoting dense, intertwined vegetation. The af'āl plural pattern here is used for paucity or intensity.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse completes the rain-to-harvest chain (verses 14-16): rain descends, grain and plants emerge, and finally lush gardens flourish. The progression from ḥabb (basic grain) to nabāt (vegetation) to jannāt alfāfan (dense, intertwined gardens) creates a crescendo of abundance, climaxing with the most luxuriant image. The word alfāf evokes gardens so thick with growth that branches and leaves intertwine -- a picture of overflowing divine generosity that concludes the creation-blessings section on its richest note.

### Verse 17


<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ يَوْمَ الْفَصْلِ كَانَ مِيقَاتًا"
  transliteration="Inna yawmal-faṣli kāna mīqātā"
  translation="Indeed, the Day of Judgment has been appointed"

| 2 | يَوْمَ | yawma | ي-و-م | Noun - masculine singular, definite by idafa | Subject of inna (ism inna) - accusative | the Day |
| 3 | الْفَصْلِ | al-fasli | ف-ص-ل | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Second term of idafa (mudhaf ilayh) - genitive | of Judgment/Decision |
| 4 | كَانَ | kaana | ك-و-ن | Verb - past, 3rd person masculine singular | Auxiliary verb - kana (past of incomplete verb) | was / has been |
| 5 | مِيقَاتًا | miiqaatan | و-ق-ت | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar mimi | Predicate of kana (khabar kaana) - accusative | an appointed time |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Inna is an emphatic particle that governs its ism (subject) in the accusative. Yawma is the ism of inna (accusative), and it forms an iḍāfa with al-faṣli (genitive as muḍāf ilayhi). The khabar (predicate) of inna is the verbal clause kāna mīqātan, where kāna is a nāqiṣ (incomplete) verb and mīqātan is its khabar (predicate of kāna, accusative). The full analysis: inna (emphatic) + yawma l-faṣli (ism inna, accusative) + kāna mīqātan (khabar inna as a verbal sentence).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-faṣl from the root f-ṣ-l on the fa'l pattern means "separation, decision, judgment" -- the Day when truth is separated from falsehood. Mīqātan is a maṣdar mīmī (mīm-prefixed noun) from the root w-q-t on the mīf'āl pattern, denoting an appointed time or deadline. The mīm prefix transforms the root concept of "time" into "a specifically appointed time."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse marks the pivotal transition from creation-blessings (verses 6-16) to eschatological consequence (verses 17-40). The inna particle signals a shift in register from rhetorical questions to emphatic declarations. Calling it yawm al-faṣl (Day of Decision/Separation) rather than yawm al-qiyāma (Day of Resurrection) emphasizes the judicial function: it is the day when accounts are settled. The use of kāna ("has been") with mīqātan implies that this appointment was fixed in pre-eternity -- it has always been determined.

### Verse 18


<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَ يُنفَخُ فِي الصُّورِ فَتَأْتُونَ أَفْوَاجًا"
  transliteration="Yawma yunfakhu fiṣ-ṣūri fa ta'tūna afwājā"

| 7 | أَفْوَاجًا | afwaajan | ف-و-ج | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite | Circumstantial qualifier (haal) - accusative | groups/multitudes |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Yawma functions as a badal (appositive) from yawma l-faṣl in verse 17, further specifying which day is meant. Yunfakhu is a passive present tense verb (mabnī li-l-majhūl) in the indicative, with the agent (Isrāfīl) deliberately unspecified. Fī l-ṣūri is a prepositional phrase. The fā' in fa-ta'tūna is fā' al-sababiyya (causal/consequential), linking the Horn being blown to the result: people arriving. Afwājan is ḥāl (circumstantial accusative) describing the manner of arrival.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yunfakhu is Form I passive (yuf'alu) from the root n-f-kh (to blow). The passive voice is formed by the ḍamma-fatḥa vowel pattern on the prefix and stem. Al-ṣūr from the root ṣ-w-r denotes the Horn or Trumpet. Afwāj is the broken plural of fawj (group, multitude) on the af'āl pattern from the root f-w-j.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The passive voice yunfakhu conceals the agent, creating an atmosphere of impersonal cosmic power -- the Horn is blown by an unnamed force, emphasizing the overwhelming nature of the event over the identity of its executor. The fā' creates immediate causation: the instant the Horn sounds, humanity arrives. Afwājan (in multitudes/groups) contrasts with the individualized judgment that will follow -- they come collectively but will be judged individually. The verse shifts from theological declaration (verse 17) to vivid narrative scene-setting.

### Verse 19


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَفُتِحَتِ السَّمَاءُ فَكَانَتْ أَبْوَابًا"
  transliteration="Wa futiḥatis-samā'u fa kānat abwābā"
  translation="And the heaven is opened and becomes gateways"

| 3 | السَّمَاءُ | al-samaa'u | س-م-و | Noun - feminine singular, definite | Subject of passive verb (naa'ib al-faa'il) - nominative | the heaven/sky |
| 4 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable - consequential conjunction | so / then |

| 6 | أَبْوَابًا | abwaaban | ب-و-ب | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite | Predicate of kana (khabar kaana) - accusative | gateways/doors |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Futiḥat is a passive past tense verb (mabnī li-l-majhūl) with the tā' al-ta'nīth (feminine marker) agreeing with the subject. Al-samā'u is the nā'ib al-fā'il (deputy subject, nominative) of the passive verb. Fa-kānat is a fā' sababiyya (consequential) + kāna (feminine), and abwāban is the khabar of kāna (accusative). The structure shows cause and effect: the heaven was opened, and as a consequence it became gateways.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Futiḥat is Form I passive past (fu'ilat) from the root f-t-ḥ (to open). The passive is formed by the ḍamma-kasra vowel pattern (fu-ti-ḥa). Al-samā' from the root s-m-w is a feminine noun. Abwāb is the broken plural of bāb (door/gate) on the af'āl pattern from the root b-w-b.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The passive construction continues the pattern of impersonal cosmic upheaval from verse 18 -- the heavens are acted upon by a force so great it need not be named. The transformation from solid heaven (built strong in verse 12) to abwāb (gateways full of openings) is a dramatic reversal that demonstrates Allah's absolute power: what He constructed firmly, He dismantles completely. The fā' connecting the two clauses makes the transformation instantaneous and inevitable.

### Verse 20


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَسُيِّرَتِ الْجِبَالُ فَكَانَتْ سَرَابًا"
  transliteration="Wa suyyiratil-jibālu fa kānat sarābā"

| 6 | سَرَابًا | saraaban | س-ر-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Predicate of kana (khabar kaana) - accusative | a mirage |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The structure exactly parallels verse 19: passive verb (suyyirat) + nā'ib al-fā'il (al-jibālu, nominative) + fā' sababiyya + kānat + khabar (sarāban, accusative). Al-jibālu is nominative as the deputy subject of the passive verb. The parallelism between verses 19 and 20 creates a paired description of cosmic dissolution: heaven torn open, mountains dissolved.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Suyyirat is Form II passive past (fu''ilat) from the root s-y-r (to travel, move). Form II adds intensity and causation to the base meaning: not merely "moved" but "forcefully set in motion, driven." The passive of Form II (suyyira) indicates the mountains were made to move against their nature. Sarāban from the root s-r-b on the fa'āl pattern means "mirage" -- something that appears real from a distance but is insubstantial.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The intra-sūrah contrast is devastatingly effective: in verse 7, mountains were awtād (stakes of permanence), but here they become sarāb (mirage of nothingness). This reversal encapsulates the surah's theological argument: the very signs of Allah's creative power become evidence of His destructive power on the Last Day. The choice of sarāb rather than turāb (dust) or habā' (scattered particles) emphasizes the deceptive nature of worldly permanence -- what seemed solid was always, in the cosmic scheme, as insubstantial as a mirage.

### Verse 21


<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ جَهَنَّمَ كَانَتْ مِرْصَادًا"
  transliteration="Inna jahannama kānat mirṣādā"
  translation="Indeed, Hell has been lying in wait"

| 4 | مِرْصَادًا | mirsaadan | ر-ص-د | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar mimi (place noun) | Predicate of kana (khabar kaana) - accusative | a place of lying in wait / an ambush |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Inna governs jahannama as its ism (accusative). Jahannama is a diptote (mamnū' min al-ṣarf) -- it takes fatḥa instead of kasra in the genitive and has no tanwīn, because it is a foreign proper noun and feminine. The khabar of inna is the verbal clause kānat mirṣādan, where kānat is the nāqiṣ verb (feminine, agreeing with jahannam) and mirṣādan is the khabar of kāna (accusative). This creates a double emphasis: inna + kāna together reinforce certainty.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Jahannama is a non-Arabic (a'jamī) proper noun with no Arabic root derivation. Mirṣādan is a maṣdar mīmī (mīm-prefixed noun of place) from the root r-ṣ-d on the mif'āl pattern, meaning "a place of lying in wait, an observation post, an ambush." The mif'āl pattern typically denotes instruments or places where an action occurs. Kānat takes the tā' al-ta'nīth because jahannam is grammatically feminine.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Describing Hell as mirṣād (an ambush, lying in wait) is a terrifying personification (tashkhīṣ). Hell is not passive but active -- it watches, waits, and is ready for the transgressors. This opens the punishment section (verses 21-30) with an image of calculated, patient menace rather than sudden violence. The inna + kāna layering creates rhetorical certainty: this is not speculation but established fact, true from before time.

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Li-l-ṭāghīna is a prepositional phrase (lām + genitive) specifying for whom Hell lies in ambush. Al-ṭāghīna is majrūr (genitive), marked by the yā' because it is a sound masculine plural (its genitive and accusative forms use yā' + nūn). Ma'āban is a badal (appositive) from mirṣādan in verse 21, further specifying Hell's function (accusative with tanwīn). Alternatively, it can be analyzed as a second khabar of kāna.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-ṭāghīna is the sound masculine plural of ṭāghin, a Form I active participle from the root ṭ-gh-y (to transgress, exceed bounds). The active participle pattern fā'il becomes fā'ilīna in the plural oblique case. Ma'āban is a maṣdar mīmī from the root '-w-b on the maf'al pattern, meaning "a place of return, a final destination." The root '-w-b conveys returning to an original state or place.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Calling Hell a ma'āb (place of return) for the transgressors carries dark irony -- a ma'āb is normally a refuge or homecoming, but for the ṭāghīn, their "home" is Hell. The active participle al-ṭāghīna defines these people by their ongoing characteristic of transgression, not a single act. The lām in li-l-ṭāghīna shows purpose and specification: Hell was prepared specifically and deliberately for this category of people.

| 3 | أَحْقَابًا | ahqaaban | ح-ق-ب | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite | Adverb of time (zharf zamaan) - accusative | ages/long periods |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Lābithīna is a ḥāl (circumstantial accusative) describing the state of the ṭāghīn: "remaining/dwelling." As a sound masculine plural in the accusative, it takes the yā' + nūn ending. Fīhā is a prepositional phrase where the feminine pronoun -hā refers back to jahannam. Aḥqāban is a ẓarf zamān (adverb of time, accusative), specifying the duration of their remaining.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Lābithīna is a Form I active participle from the root l-b-th (to remain, linger, dwell) in the sound masculine plural oblique/accusative form. The active participle denotes an ongoing state. Aḥqāb is the broken plural of ḥuqb or ḥuqub (an era, an extremely long period of time) on the af'āl pattern from the root ḥ-q-b. Each ḥuqb is traditionally understood as eighty years or more.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The ḥāl construction makes "remaining" the defining condition of their existence in Hell -- not a temporary episode but their permanent state. The use of aḥqāb (ages upon ages) rather than a definitive term like abadan (forever) creates a sense of unending renewal: one ḥuqb ends and another begins, with no conclusion in sight. The pronoun fīhā maintains the feminine reference to jahannam from verse 21, keeping Hell present as a felt reality throughout the passage.

### Verse 24


<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَّا يَذُوقُونَ فِيهَا بَرْدًا وَلَا شَرَابًا"

| 6 | شَرَابًا | sharaaban | ش-ر-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative, coordinated | drink |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Lā is a negation particle (ḥarf nafy) that negates the present tense verb yadhūqūna without changing its mood (it remains marfū'/indicative). Fīhā is a prepositional phrase (in it, referring to jahannam). Bardan is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative object) of yadhūqūna. Wa-lā shāraban continues with coordinated negation: wa is the conjunction, lā repeats the negation, and sharāban is a second coordinated maf'ūl bihi (accusative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yadhūqūna is Form I (fa'ala / yaf'ulu) from the root dh-w-q (to taste/experience). The wāw al-jamā'a suffix indicates third-person masculine plural. Bardan from the root b-r-d on the fa'l pattern means coolness or cold relief. Sharāban from the root sh-r-b on the fa'āl pattern is a maṣdar meaning drink or beverage.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verb yadhūqūna (to taste) is more visceral than simply "to have" or "to find" -- tasting implies direct, bodily sensory experience. Denying them bard (coolness) and sharāb (drink) targets the two most basic comforts a person in torment craves. The double negation (lā...wa-lā) creates a comprehensive denial structure, systematically eliminating every source of relief. This sets up the devastating exception in the next verse.

### Verse 25


<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَّا حَمِيمًا وَغَسَّاقًا"
  transliteration="Illā ḥamīman wa ghassāqā"
  translation="Except scalding water and [foul] purulence"
  reference="An-Naba 78:25"

| 4 | غَسَّاقًا | ghassaaqan | غ-س-ق | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Exceptive object (mustathnaa) - accusative, coordinated | purulence/foul discharge |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Illā is an exceptive particle (ḥarf istithnā') that introduces the exception to the negation in verse 24. Since the preceding negation encompasses everything, the exception is muttaṣil (connected). Ḥamīman is the mustathnā (excepted item, accusative) -- it is what they do taste. Wa-ghassāqan is coordinated with ḥamīman via wa, serving as a second excepted item (accusative). The grammar of exception after negation here effectively means "they taste nothing except these two."

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ḥamīman from the root ḥ-m-m on the fa'īl pattern denotes extremely hot, scalding liquid. The fa'īl pattern often carries an intensive or resultative meaning. Ghassāqan from the root gh-s-q on the fa''āl intensive pattern denotes an extremely foul-smelling purulent discharge. The doubled middle radical in fa''āl emphasizes the revolting intensity of this substance.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The illā exception is a rhetorical dagger: after denying them all comfort, the verse reveals that their only "refreshment" is boiling water and foul pus -- the opposite of cool drink. This is called taqābul ma'kūs (reversed contrast): the exception that should provide relief instead intensifies suffering. The pairing of ḥamīm (scalding heat) with ghassāq (putrid cold/discharge) covers the extremes of physical torment, leaving no middle ground of comfort.

### Verse 26


<ArabicExample
  arabic="جَزَاءً وِفَاقًا"
  transliteration="Jazā'an wifāqā"
  translation="An appropriate recompense"
  reference="An-Naba 78:26"
  highlight="جَزَاءً,وِفَاقًا"

| 1 | جَزَاءً | jazaa'an | ج-з-ي | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar | Specification (tamyiiz) or maf'ul mutlaq - accusative | a recompense/reward |
| 2 | وِفَاقًا | wifaaqan | و-ف-ق | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - accusative, describing jazaa'an | fitting/appropriate |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Jazā'an can be analyzed as a maf'ūl muṭlaq (absolute/cognate object) for an implied verb -- "[We recompense them] a recompense" -- or as a tamyīz (specification) explaining the nature of what precedes it. Wifāqan is a na't (adjective, accusative) modifying jazā'an, meaning "fitting, corresponding, appropriate." Both words are in the accusative with tanwīn (indefinite).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Jazā'an is a maṣdar from the root j-z-y on the fa'āl pattern, meaning recompense or requital. Wifāqan from the root w-f-q on the fi'āl pattern derives from wāfaqa (to correspond, to match). The fi'āl pattern here denotes the quality of correspondence or fitness -- the punishment matches (wāfaqa) the crime precisely.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This terse, two-word verse is a masterpiece of ījāz (extreme brevity). After the vivid details of punishment in verses 21-25, these two words provide the theological justification: it is all jazā'an wifāqan -- a fitting recompense. The brevity itself is rhetorical: divine justice needs no elaboration. The word wifāqan asserts the principle of proportional justice ('adl) -- the punishment is not arbitrary or excessive but precisely calibrated to match what the transgressors earned.

### Verse 27


<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُمْ كَانُوا لَا يَرْجُونَ حِسَابًا"
  transliteration="Innahum kānū lā yarjūna ḥisābā"

| 5 | حِسَابًا | hisaaban | ح-س-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative | an account/reckoning |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Innahum consists of inna + the attached pronoun -hum as ism of inna (accusative). The khabar of inna is the verbal clause kānū lā yarjūna ḥisāban. Kānū is the nāqiṣ verb (past, plural), and its khabar is the negated clause lā yarjūna ḥisāban. This creates a layered structure: inna provides emphasis, kāna establishes past habitual action, and lā negates the verb. Ḥisāban is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative) of yarjūna.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yarjūna is Form I (fa'ala / yaf'ulu) from the root r-j-w (to hope, expect, anticipate). The wāw al-jamā'a marks third-person masculine plural. Ḥisāban from the root ḥ-s-b on the fi'āl pattern is a maṣdar meaning accounting, reckoning, or judgment. Kānū shows the weak final radical of kāna (k-w-n) with the wāw eliding before the plural suffix.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse explains the "why" behind the punishment described in verses 21-26, answering the implicit question: why is this fitting (wifāqan)? The triple-layered emphasis (inna + kāna + lā) drives home the depth of their denial. Using yarjūna (to expect/hope for) rather than yu'minūna (to believe in) is precise: their crime was not merely intellectual disbelief but a lived assumption that no accounting would ever occur, which led to their unbounded transgression.

### Verse 28


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَكَذَّبُوا بِآيَاتِنَا كِذَّابًا"
  transliteration="Wa kadhdhabū bi-āyātinā kidhdhābā"
  translation="And denied Our signs with [emphatic] denial"

| 3 | بِ | bi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition governing genitive | with / in |
| 4 | آيَاتِنَا | aayaatinaa | أ-ي-ي | Noun - feminine plural, with possessive pronoun | Object of preposition (majrur) + 1st person plural possessive | Our signs/verses |
| 5 | كِذَّابًا | kidhdhaaban | ك-ذ-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar | Absolute object (maf'ul mutlaq) - accusative | denial / [intensive] denying |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Wa-kadhdhabū is coordinated with kānū lā yarjūna from verse 27, adding a second charge against the transgressors. The verb kadhdhabū governs bi-āyātinā as a prepositional complement (the bā' is used with kadhdhaba to indicate what is denied). Kidhdāban is a maf'ūl muṭlaq (absolute/cognate object, accusative) that intensifies the verb -- "they denied with [emphatic] denial."

**Sarf (Morphology):** Kadhdhabū is Form II (fa''ala) from the root k-dh-b (to lie, deny). The doubled middle radical dh in Form II adds intensive/emphatic meaning: not merely disbelieving but actively, forcefully rejecting. Kidhdāban is the maṣdar of the Form II verb, also on an intensive pattern. Āyātinā is the sound feminine plural of āya (sign, verse) with the possessive pronoun -nā (our).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The maf'ūl muṭlaq construction (kadhdhabū...kidhdāban) creates emphatic intensification through morphological echo -- the verb and its cognate object share the same root, amplifying the action. Their denial was not passive or casual but vehement and persistent. Pairing this verse with verse 27 creates a two-count indictment: (1) they expected no reckoning, and (2) they actively denied the signs. The possessive -nā (Our signs) adds a personal dimension -- they rejected Allah's own communications.

### Verse 29


<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَكُلَّ شَيْءٍ أَحْصَيْنَاهُ كِتَابًا"

| 5 | كِتَابًا | kitaaban | ك-ت-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, masdar | Absolute object (maf'ul mutlaq) or specification (tamyiiz) - accusative | in writing / as a record |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Kulla shay'in is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative) of aḥṣaynāhu, but it is fronted (muqaddam) before the verb for emphasis (taqdīm al-maf'ūl). Kulla is an iḍāfa with shay'in (genitive as muḍāf ilayhi). Aḥṣaynāhu contains the verb, subject pronoun -nā, and object pronoun -hu (which refers back to kulla shay'in). Kitāban is either a maf'ūl muṭlaq (we recorded it as a recording) or a tamyīz (specifying the manner: in writing).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Aḥṣaynā is Form IV (af'ala) from the root ḥ-ṣ-y (to count, enumerate, record). The Form IV hamza prefix adds causative/intensive meaning: to count completely, to encompass in enumeration. Kitāban from the root k-t-b on the fi'āl pattern can mean both "a writing/book" and "a written record." Shay'in from the root sh-y-' is among the most common indefinite nouns in Arabic.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The fronting of kulla shay'in (everything) before the verb is a powerful rhetorical device (taqdīm li-l-ihtimām): by placing "everything" first, the verse emphasizes the comprehensiveness of divine knowledge before specifying the action. Nothing escapes the record. This verse responds to their disbelief in ḥisāb (verse 27): they denied the reckoning, but Allah has already recorded everything. The word kitāban grounds the abstract concept of divine knowledge in the concrete image of a written ledger -- inescapable evidence.

### Verse 30


<ArabicExample

| 7 | عَذَابًا | 'adhaaban | ع-ذ-ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Specification (tamyiiz) - accusative | in torment/punishment |
</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Fa-dhūqū begins with fā' al-sababiyya (consequential) and dhūqū is an imperative verb (fi'l amr) in the second-person masculine plural. The second fā' introduces the consequence: lan is a negation particle that governs the subjunctive, making nazīdakum manṣūb (marked by fatḥa). -Kum is the object pronoun. Illā is the exceptive particle, and 'adhāban is the tamyīz or mustathnā (accusative), specifying what the increase consists of.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Dhūqū is Form I imperative from the root dh-w-q (to taste). The imperative of hollow verbs retains the long vowel: dhūqū. Nazīdakum is Form I (fa'ala / yaf'ilu) from the root z-y-d (to increase), in the subjunctive after lan, with the first-person plural prefix na- and the object suffix -kum. 'Adhāban from the root '-dh-b on the fa'āl pattern is a maṣdar meaning torment or punishment.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse concludes the punishment section with devastating finality. The imperative dhūqū (taste!) is used sarcastically and harshly -- a command that mocks their helplessness. Lan provides the strongest possible future negation in Arabic: "never, ever will We increase you except in torment." The exception structure (lan...illā) means that the only possible future change is more suffering, never less. This verse is reported in hadith as the harshest verse upon the people of Hell -- it eliminates all hope of relief or reduction.

### Verse 31


<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ لِلْمُتَّقِينَ مَفَازًا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Inna is the emphatic particle. Its ism is mafāzan (accusative, delayed/mu'akhkhar), and its khabar is the prepositional phrase li-l-muttaqīna (fronted/muqaddam). This inversion (taqdīm al-khabar 'alā l-ism) places emphasis on the recipients ("for the righteous") before naming what they receive. Al-muttaqīna is majrūr (genitive) after the preposition li, marked by yā' as a sound masculine plural in the oblique case.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-muttaqīna is a Form VIII (ifta'ala) active participle from the root w-q-y (to guard, protect). The tā' infix of Form VIII adds reflexive meaning: "those who guard themselves" against sin and divine punishment. The initial wāw of the root assimilates into the tā', producing muttaqī instead of the expected muwtaqī. Mafāzan is a maṣdar mīmī from the root f-w-z on the maf'al pattern, meaning "a place of success, salvation, triumph."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse marks the dramatic tonal shift from punishment (verses 21-30) to reward (verses 31-36), creating a taqābul (contrast) structure that is the architectural spine of the surah. The fronting of li-l-muttaqīna before mafāzan emphasizes the recipients over the reward -- after ten verses detailing what happens to the transgressors, the listener's first question is "what about the righteous?" and the answer begins with them. The inna particle signals the same register of certainty used for Hell (verse 21), establishing equal weight for both outcomes.

### Verse 32

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Ḥadā'iqa is a badal (appositive) from mafāzan in verse 31, specifying what the mafāz consists of (accusative). As a diptote broken plural (ṣīghat muntahā l-jumū'), it takes fatḥa for all case endings and has no tanwīn. Wa-a'nāban is coordinated with ḥadā'iqa via wa (accusative with tanwīn because it is a triptote broken plural).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ḥadā'iq is the broken plural of ḥadīqa (enclosed garden, orchard) from the root ḥ-d-q on the fa'ā'il pattern, which is a standard broken plural pattern for fa'īla nouns. A'nāb is the broken plural of 'inab (grape/grapevine) from the root '-n-b on the af'āl pattern. The singular-to-plural transformation follows regular patterns for both nouns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The badal construction creates an unfolding revelation: mafāz (success) is first named abstractly, then concretized as ḥadā'iq (walled gardens) and a'nāb (grapevines). This movement from abstract to concrete makes the reward tangible and sensory. The specific mention of a'nāb (grapes) alongside general gardens reflects the Quranic pattern of naming specific luxuries alongside general categories -- grapes being among the most prized fruits in Arabian culture, symbolizing abundance and pleasure.

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Wa-kawā'iba is coordinated with the preceding list of rewards, continuing as another badal or coordinated item in the accusative. As a diptote broken plural (ṣīghat muntahā l-jumū' on the fawā'il pattern), it takes fatḥa without tanwīn. Atrāban is either a na't (adjective, accusative) describing kawā'ib or a ḥāl (circumstantial accusative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Kawā'ib is the broken plural of kā'ib (a woman whose breasts have become full/rounded) from the root k-'-b on the fawā'il pattern. The root k-'-b relates to protuberance and roundness. Atrāban is the broken plural of tirb (peer, age-mate) from the root t-r-b on the af'āl pattern, denoting people of the same age or status.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The description of companions as atrāb (peers of equal age) emphasizes harmony and compatibility in Paradise -- there is no discord, jealousy, or inequality. The pairing of physical description (kawā'ib) with social description (atrāb) creates a complete picture: beautiful and compatible. This verse continues the concrete, sensory specification of mafāz: after gardens and grapes (natural bounty), the surah describes human companionship, addressing another dimension of human desire.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Wa-ka'san is another coordinated item in the accusative, continuing the list of Paradise rewards. Ka'san is triptote (takes tanwīn and full case endings). Dihāqan is a na't (adjective, accusative with tanwīn) modifying ka's, describing its state as brimming full.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ka'san from the root k-'-s on the fa'l pattern is a feminine noun meaning cup or goblet (specifically one containing wine). Dihāqan from the root d-h-q on the fi'āl pattern means full, overflowing, brimming -- a cup filled to the very rim and beyond. The fi'āl pattern here conveys an intensive quality.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The ka's dihāq (brimming cup) directly contrasts with the ḥamīm and ghassāq (scalding water and pus) given to the deniers in verses 24-25. This taqābul (antithetical parallelism) is the surah's central structural device: the transgressors' drink is torment, while the righteous' drink overflows with pleasure. The word dihāq emphasizes not just fullness but abundance without end -- the cup is never empty, paralleling the aḥqāb (endless ages) of the transgressors' suffering with an equally boundless provision of delight.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Lā negates the present tense verb yasma'ūna (indicative, marfū') without affecting its mood. Fīhā is a prepositional phrase (in it, referring to Paradise/jannāt). Laghwan is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative). Wa-lā kidhdhāban adds a second negated object coordinated with laghwan. The double negation (lā...wa-lā) creates comprehensive exclusion of both types of unpleasant speech.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yasma'ūna is Form I (fa'ila / yaf'alu) from the root s-m-' (to hear), with wāw al-jamā'a as the plural subject marker. Laghwan from the root l-gh-w on the fa'l pattern means idle talk, frivolous speech, or gossip. Kidhdhāban is the intensive maṣdar from the root k-dh-b, the same word used in verse 28 to describe the deniers' emphatic denial of Allah's signs.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verbal echo of kidhdhāban from verse 28 creates a powerful intra-sūrah connection: the deniers were characterized by kidhdhāb (emphatic lying/denial), but in Paradise, kidhdhāb is entirely absent. What defined the transgressors' world is erased from the righteous' world. The negation of hearing (lā yasma'ūna) rather than speaking suggests that the environment itself is purified -- not only do the righteous not speak falsehood, they are never even subjected to hearing it. This adds spiritual purity to the physical comforts already described.

### Verse 36


<ArabicExample
  arabic="جَزَاءً مِّن رَّبِّكَ عَطَاءً حِسَابًا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Jazā'an functions as a maf'ūl muṭlaq or tamyīz (accusative), paralleling jazā'an wifāqan in verse 26 for the punishment section. Min rabbika is a prepositional phrase specifying the source of the reward, with rabbika in the genitive (the -ka suffix shifts to second-person singular address). 'Aṭā'an is a badal (appositive, accusative) from jazā'an, further specifying the reward as a gift. Ḥisāban is a na't (adjective, accusative) modifying 'aṭā'an, meaning "sufficient" or "reckoned/calculated."

**Sarf (Morphology):** Jazā'an is the same maṣdar from j-z-y seen in verse 26. 'Aṭā'an is a maṣdar from the root '-ṭ-w on the fa'āl pattern, meaning a bestowal, gift, or generous grant. Ḥisāban from the root ḥ-s-b on the fi'āl pattern can mean both "sufficient" (as in ḥasbuka = enough for you) and "calculated, precisely reckoned." The dual meaning enriches the verse.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse mirrors verse 26 (jazā'an wifāqan) with jazā'an...ḥisāban, creating a structural parallel between the punishment and reward sections. However, the reward verse is richer: it adds min rabbika (personalizing the source) and 'aṭā'an (specifying it as a generous gift, not merely a transaction). The shift to singular address (-ka) is an iltifāt (shift in person) that personalizes the relationship -- the Prophet or believer is addressed directly. Calling the reward 'aṭā' (gift) rather than ujra (wage) emphasizes divine grace: it exceeds what was earned.

### Verse 37


<ArabicExample
  arabic="رَّبِّ السَّمَاوَاتِ وَالْأَرْضِ وَمَا بَيْنَهُمَا الرَّحْمَٰنِ ۖ لَا يَمْلِكُونَ مِنْهُ خِطَابًا"

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Rabbi is a badal (appositive) from rabbika in verse 36, in the genitive case. It forms an extended iḍāfa chain: rabbi l-samāwāti wa-l-arḍi wa-mā baynahumā. Al-samāwāti is the muḍāf ilayhi (genitive); wa-l-arḍi and wa-mā baynahumā are coordinated with it. Al-Raḥmāni is a second badal from rabbi (genitive), adding another divine name. The second clause lā yamlikūna minhu khiṭāban is a new verbal sentence: yamlikūna is negated by lā (indicative), minhu is a prepositional phrase, and khiṭāban is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Al-samāwāt is the sound feminine plural of samā' from the root s-m-w. Al-Raḥmān is an intensive form (fa'lān) from the root r-ḥ-m, denoting all-encompassing mercy as a permanent divine attribute. Yamlikūna is Form I from the root m-l-k (to possess, own, have authority over). Khiṭāban from the root kh-ṭ-b on the fi'āl pattern is a maṣdar meaning speech, discourse, or address.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The expansive iḍāfa chain (Lord of the heavens, the earth, and everything between) establishes divine sovereignty at its most comprehensive before declaring that no one possesses authority for speech. The juxtaposition of al-Raḥmān (the Most Merciful) with the denial of speech authority creates a profound paradox: even His mercy does not negate His absolute sovereignty. The verse transitions the surah into its final scene -- the Day when all creation stands speechless before the Most Merciful, setting up the exception in verse 38.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Yawma is a ẓarf zamān (adverb of time, accusative) linked to the preceding verse's scene. Yaqūmu is an indicative present verb; al-rūḥu is its fā'il (subject, nominative), and wa-l-malā'ikatu is coordinated with it (nominative). Ṣaffan is ḥāl (circumstantial accusative) describing their manner of standing. The second clause introduces an exception: lā yatakallamūna (negated verb) + illā (exception) + man (relative/conditional pronoun) + adhina lahu l-Raḥmānu (relative clause). Wa-qāla ṣawāban is coordinated with adhina, adding a second condition.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Yaqūmu is Form I from the root q-w-m (to stand). Al-rūḥ from the root r-w-ḥ on the fu'l pattern refers to Jibrīl (Gabriel) or the spirit generally. Yatakallamūna is Form V (tafa''ala) from the root k-l-m, indicating deliberate, self-initiated speech. Ṣaffan from the root ṣ-f-f on the fa'l pattern means a row or rank. Ṣawāban from the root ṣ-w-b on the fa'āl pattern means what is correct, right, or true.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The image of the Spirit and angels standing in ṣaff (ordered rows) conveys military-like discipline and awe before the Divine. The exception structure (illā man adhina lahu l-Raḥmān) establishes that speech on that Day is not a right but a privilege granted by divine permission. The dual condition -- both permission (adhina) and correctness (qāla ṣawāban) -- means that even permitted speech must be true. This double filter on speech contrasts powerfully with the worldly laghw and kidhdhāb (vain talk and lies) negated in verse 35.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Dhālika is a demonstrative pronoun functioning as mubtada' (subject, nominative). Al-yawmu is the khabar (predicate, nominative), and al-ḥaqqu is a na't (adjective, nominative) modifying al-yawm. The second clause introduces a conditional: fa-man is fā' al-faṣīḥa (explanatory) + man as a conditional pronoun (subject). Shā'a is the fi'l al-sharṭ (conditional verb, past tense used for future meaning). Ittakhadha is the jawāb al-sharṭ (apodosis, past tense for future). Ilā rabbihi is a prepositional phrase, and ma'āban is the maf'ūl bihi (accusative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Dhālika is a compound demonstrative pronoun for distant reference (dhā + li + ka). Al-ḥaqq from the root ḥ-q-q on the fa'l pattern means truth, reality, or what is genuine. Shā'a is Form I from the root sh-y-' (to will, wish). Ittakhadha is Form VIII (ifta'ala) from the root '-kh-dh (to take), where the Form VIII adds deliberateness: "to take for oneself, to adopt, to choose." Ma'āban is a maṣdar mīmī from '-w-b (to return).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the terrifying scenes of Judgment, this verse shifts to invitation: "So whoever wills may take a path of return to his Lord." The conditional man shā'a affirms human free will -- the choice to prepare for that Day belongs to each individual. The word ma'āb (place of return) echoes verse 22 where it described Hell as the transgressors' ma'āb, but here it is reframed positively: the path back to Allah through repentance and good deeds. This dual use of ma'āb ties the surah's warning and invitation together.

</GrammarTable>


#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Innā (inna + nā) provides emphasis, with the pronoun -nā as ism of inna (accusative). Andharnākum is the khabar of inna (a verbal clause): Form IV verb with subject -nā and object -kum. 'Adhāban is the second maf'ūl bihi (accusative), and qarīban is its na't (adjective, accusative). Yawma is a ẓarf zamān (accusative) specifying when the punishment occurs. Yanẓuru l-mar'u is a verbal clause; mā qaddamat yadāhu is a relative clause (mā as relative pronoun, qaddamat as verb, yadāhu as fā'il in the dual nominative). The final clause wa-yaqūlu l-kāfiru introduces reported speech: yā laytanī (exclamatory + wish particle + 1st person pronoun) kuntu turāban (kāna + khabar accusative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Andharnākum is Form IV (af'ala) from n-dh-r (to warn), with the hamza prefix adding transitivity. Yanẓuru is Form I from n-ẓ-r (to look/observe). Qaddamat is Form II from q-d-m (to advance/send forward), with the doubled dāl indicating intensity. Yadāhu is the dual of yad (hand) from y-d-y, with the alif dual marker + possessive -hu. Laytanī consists of layta (wish particle for impossible wishes, governing accusative) + the nūn al-wiqāya + the first-person yā' pronoun. Turāban from t-r-b on the fu'āl pattern means dust or earth.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This climactic final verse combines divine warning (andharnākum), vivid scene-painting (yanẓuru l-mar'u), and dramatic speech (yā laytanī kuntu turāban) in a single sweeping sentence. The iltifāt (shift in person) from Allah's address to the kāfir's speech creates dramatic juxtaposition: divine authority versus human despair. The metonymy of yadāhu (his two hands) for all one's deeds is a kinesthetic image -- hands that acted now present their work for judgment. The impossible wish (tammannī mustaḥīl) to become dust is the ultimate expression of regret: the disbeliever wishes for annihilation rather than face what he denied. This forms the surah's emotional and rhetorical climax.

Both مِهَادًا and أَوْتَادًا are mafʿūl bihi thānī (second direct object) of the verb جَعَلَ, which takes two objects when it means 'to make/render something into something.' The first mafʿūl bihi is الأَرْضَ and الجِبَالَ respectively. Both take fatḥa with tanwīn because they are indefinite, singular nouns in the manṣūb case. This double-object جَعَلَ pattern recurs throughout verses 6-16, creating a rhythmic catalogue of divine blessings.

<ExerciseBox question="Contrast the verb forms in verse 19 (وَفُتِحَتِ ٱلسَّمَاءُ فَكَانَتْ أَبْوَٰبًا) and verse 12 (وَبَنَيْنَا فَوْقَكُمْ سَبْعًا شِدَادًا). Why does the surah switch between active and passive voice?">

In verse 12, بَنَيْنَا is active voice (mabnī lil-maʿlūm) with the fāʿil being Allah (expressed through نَا, the first-person plural pronoun of majesty). In verse 19, فُتِحَتِ is passive voice (mabnī lil-majhūl), with السَّمَاءُ serving as nā'ib al-fāʿil. The shift is rhetorically deliberate: the active voice in the blessings section (vv. 6-16) emphasizes Allah's direct creative agency and care, while the passive voice in the judgment section (vv. 17-20) creates a sense of impersonal cosmic upheaval where even the heavens and mountains are acted upon by forces beyond description. This active-to-passive shift mirrors the transition from raḥma (mercy) to qudra (power).
