# Al-Kawthar (Abundance)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 3
- **Theme:** Assures the Prophet of Allah's abundant blessings (including a river in Paradise) and commands him to pray and sacrifice, declaring that his detractors are the truly cut-off ones.
- **Grammar Focus:** إِنَّا (inna + pronoun) construction, past tense first person plural verbs, imperative mood verbs, nominal sentence with إِنَّ structure

### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ | Nominal (إِنَّ) | إِنَّ + dual attached pronouns | Divine gift of abundance |
| 2 | فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ | Imperative | فَ consequential + two commands | Worship through prayer and sacrifice |
| 3 | إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ | Nominal (إِنَّ) | Active participle + damir al-fasl | Enemy is the truly cut off |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Surah of Contrasts">
Al-Kawthar is a masterclass in brevity — the shortest surah in the Quran at just 3 verses and 10 words. It uses إِنَّ in both verse 1 and verse 3 to create a frame: "Indeed WE gave you abundance" → "Indeed YOUR ENEMY is cut off." The grammar mirrors the theology: what was said about the Prophet (cut off) is reversed onto his enemies, using the same emphatic particle.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَاكَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّا | innā | - | Particle + attached pronoun | Emphasis particle (harf tawkid) + subject pronoun (ism inna) accusative | indeed We |
| 2 | أَعْطَيْنَاكَ | aʿṭaynāka | ع ط و | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 1st person, plural + attached pronoun | Predicate of inna (khabar inna) - nominative position, + object pronoun accusative | We gave you, granted you |
| 3 | الْكَوْثَرَ | al-kawthar | ك و ث ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with fatha | al-Kawthar, abundance |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="إِنَّا: Contraction of إِنَّ + نَا">
إِنَّا is a contraction of إِنَّ + نَا (We). The pronoun نَا functions as the ism of إِنَّ in the accusative position. Meanwhile, أَعْطَيْنَاكَ carries dual attached pronouns: نَا (We — the subject/doer) and كَ (you — the object/receiver). One verb packs in two pronoun roles simultaneously.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence introduced by إِنَّ. The ism of إِنَّ is the attached pronoun نَا (We) in accusative position. The khabar is the entire verbal sentence أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ. The verb أَعْطَى is ditransitive (takes two objects): the first object is كَ (you) and the second is الْكَوْثَرَ (al-Kawthar), both accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَعْطَى is a Form IV verb (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from root ع-ط-و, meaning "to give/grant." Form IV adds a causative/transitive meaning to the base root. The past tense conjugation for first person plural adds نَا, giving أَعْطَيْنَا. الْكَوْثَرَ follows the فَوْعَل quadriliteral pattern, denoting abundance and great quantity.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The use of the royal "We" (نَا) emphasizes the majesty of the Giver. The proper noun الْكَوْثَرَ (with the definite article الـ) is used rather than a generic "abundance," indicating a specific, known blessing — a river in Paradise. Opening the surah with إِنَّ signals that what follows counters a claim the audience may resist. The divine gift is presented as an established, undeniable fact.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَانْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
  highlight="فَ,صَلِّ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Consequential conjunction - not declinable | so, therefore |
| 2 | صَلِّ | ṣalli | ص ل و | Verb - Form II, imperative, 2nd person, masculine, singular | Imperative verb (fi'l amr) | pray |
| 3 | لِ | li | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition - not declinable | for, to |
| 4 | رَبِّكَ | rabbika | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + attached pronoun | Object of preposition (majrur) - genitive with kasra, + possessive pronoun genitive | your Lord |
| 5 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction - not declinable | and |
| 6 | انْحَرْ | inḥar | ن ح ر | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person, masculine, singular | Imperative verb (fi'l amr) | sacrifice |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Two Imperative Forms Compared">
Notice the different imperative formations: صَلِّ (Form II, from صَلَّى) loses its final alif and needs no hamzat al-wasl because Form II's doubled middle letter provides a voweled start. But انْحَرْ (Form I, from نَحَرَ) requires hamzat al-wasl (اِ) because removing the prefix leaves a consonant cluster (نْحَرْ). The form of the verb dictates the shape of its imperative.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is a consequential conjunction (fa al-sababiyyah) linking the command in verse 2 to the gift in verse 1: because We gave you abundance, therefore pray. Two imperative verbs are coordinated by وَ. The prepositional phrase لِرَبِّكَ specifies the exclusive recipient of prayer.

**Sarf (Morphology):** صَلِّ derives from root ص-ل-و on the Form II pattern (فَعَّلَ → صَلَّى). The imperative is formed by dropping the prefix تُ from تُصَلِّي and removing the final ي, yielding صَلِّ. انْحَرْ derives from root ن-ح-ر on the Form I pattern, with hamzat al-wasl added because removing the prefix leaves a sukun on the first radical.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The brevity — just two words for two acts of worship — mirrors the directness of divine instruction. Pairing prayer (spiritual worship) with sacrifice (physical worship) encompasses the totality of devotion. The specification لِرَبِّكَ ("to YOUR Lord") personalizes the relationship, reminding the Prophet that his prayer is directed to the same Lord who granted him al-Kawthar.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ"
  transliteration="inna shāni'aka huwa l-abtar"
  translation="Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:3"
  highlight="شَانِئَكَ,الْأَبْتَرُ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّ | inna | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (harf tawkid) - governs accusative | indeed |
| 2 | شَانِئَكَ | shāni'aka | ش ن ا | Noun - active participle, masculine, singular, indefinite + attached pronoun | Subject of inna (ism inna) - accusative (mansub) with fatha, + possessive pronoun genitive | your hater, enemy |
| 3 | هُوَ | huwa | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person masculine singular | Pronoun of separation (damir al-fasl) - not declinable | he (emphatic) |
| 4 | الْأَبْتَرُ | al-abtar | ب ت ر | Noun - adjective, masculine, singular, definite | Predicate of inna (khabar inna) - nominative (marfu') with damma | the cut off, the one without legacy |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="إِنَّ: Dual Case Governance">
إِنَّ makes the subject (ism inna) accusative and predicate (khabar inna) nominative. Compare: شَانِئَكَ ends with fatha (accusative, as ism inna) while الْأَبْتَرُ ends with damma (nominative, as khabar inna). This dual case governance is the defining feature of إِنَّ and its sisters.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Pronoun of Separation (Damir al-Fasl)">
هُوَ here is not the subject — إِنَّ already has its ism (شَانِئَكَ). Instead, هُوَ is damir al-fasl, a pronoun of separation that (1) separates ism from khabar to prevent misreading as a single phrase, (2) adds emphasis ("he HIMSELF is"), and (3) restricts the predicate to the subject — it is ONLY your enemy who is cut off.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence introduced by إِنَّ. The ism of إِنَّ is شَانِئَكَ (accusative, marked by fatha). The khabar of إِنَّ is الْأَبْتَرُ (nominative, marked by damma). Between them sits هُوَ as damir al-fasl — it occupies no syntactic position (neither mubtada nor khabar) but serves as separator and emphasizer.

**Sarf (Morphology):** شَانِئَكَ comes from root ش-ن-ا on the فَاعِل pattern — the standard active participle form for Form I verbs, meaning "the one who hates." The active participle functions as a noun. الْأَبْتَرُ follows the أَفْعَل pattern from root ب-ت-ر, used for elatives (comparatives) and for adjectives describing physical characteristics, here meaning "the cut-off one" — without offspring, legacy, or followers.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse mirrors verse 1 structurally — both open with إِنَّ — creating a powerful frame: "Indeed We gave you..." bookended by "Indeed your enemy is cut off." The use of the active participle شَانِئَكَ (ongoing hater) rather than a past tense verb implies the hatred is habitual and defining. The definite article on الْأَبْتَرُ makes it categorical: not just "cut off" but "THE cut-off one." The verse reverses the historical insult — opponents mocked the Prophet for having no surviving sons, but the Quran declares them to be the ones without legacy.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the ism (subject) and khabar (predicate) of إِنَّ in both Verse 1 and Verse 3. State the case of each and explain why they differ from a normal nominal sentence.">

**Verse 1: إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ**
- **Ism of إِنَّ:** نَا (the attached pronoun "We") — accusative, as required by إِنَّ
- **Khabar of إِنَّ:** The verbal sentence أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ — in the nominative position

**Verse 3: إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ الْأَبْتَرُ**
- **Ism of إِنَّ:** شَانِئَكَ ("your hater") — accusative, marked by fatha
- **Khabar of إِنَّ:** الْأَبْتَرُ ("the cut-off one") — nominative, marked by damma

**Why they differ from normal sentences:** In a normal nominal sentence, the subject (mubtada) is nominative and the predicate (khabar) is also nominative. إِنَّ and its sisters (إِنَّ، أَنَّ، كَأَنَّ، لَكِنَّ، لَيْتَ، لَعَلَّ) override this: they place the ism in the accusative while keeping the khabar nominative. This is one of the fundamental rules of Arabic syntax (nawasikh).

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the two imperative verbs in Verse 2: صَلِّ and انْحَرْ. Identify each verb's form, derive the imperative from the present tense, and explain why they look so different.">

**صَلِّ (pray):**
- **Root:** ص ل و | **Form:** II (فَعَّلَ)
- **Present tense:** يُصَلِّي (yuṣallī)
- **Derivation:** Remove prefix يُ → صَلِّي, then drop final ي (weak letter) → صَلِّ
- **No hamzat al-wasl needed** because after removing the prefix, the first letter already carries a vowel (via the shadda of Form II)

**انْحَرْ (sacrifice):**
- **Root:** ن ح ر | **Form:** I (فَعَلَ)
- **Present tense:** يَنْحَرُ (yanḥaru)
- **Derivation:** Remove prefix يَ → نْحَرْ. Initial consonant now has sukun, so hamzat al-wasl (اِ) is added → اِنْحَرْ
- **Hamzat al-wasl required** because Form I leaves a consonant cluster at the start

**Why they look different:** Form II verbs have a voweled first radical after prefix removal (due to the doubled middle letter), needing no helping vowel. Form I verbs often start with sukun, requiring hamzat al-wasl. This is why صَلِّ is short and sharp while انْحَرْ has the extra alif.
