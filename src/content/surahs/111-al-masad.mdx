#### Grammar Notes
- تَبَّتْ is a past tense verb with the feminine marker تْ because the subject يَدَا is grammatically feminine.
- يَدَا is the dual form (yadāni → yadā in construct state), requiring the verb to be feminine.
- أَبِي لَهَبٍ forms a compound name in a double iḍāfah construction.
- وَتَبَّ repeats the same root but in masculine singular form, referring to Abu Lahab himself.
- The past tense here expresses a supplication/curse for destruction (du'ā' bi-l-sharr).

### Verse 2

#### Grammar Notes
- مَا is the negation particle for past tense verbs.
- أَغْنَىٰ is Form IV of the root غ ن ي, meaning "to make rich/to avail/benefit."
- عَنْهُ shows the person who is not benefited (the preposition عَنْ can mean "from" or "concerning").
- The second مَا is a relative pronoun meaning "that which" or "what."
- كَسَبَ is the verb of the relative clause, describing what he earned.
- The entire phrase وَمَا كَسَبَ ("and what he earned") is coordinated with مَالُهُ as a second subject.

- نَارًا is the direct object in the accusative case.
- ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ is an attributive phrase (literally "possessing flame") describing the fire.
- There's wordplay with the name لَهَب (Lahab = flame) from verse 1, emphasizing poetic justice.

#### Grammar Notes
- وَامْرَأَتُهُ can be understood as coordinated with the subject of سَيَصْلَىٰ ("he will burn, and his wife [will burn too]").
- حَمَّالَةَ is in the accusative - this could be due to an implied verb ("he will burn, and his wife [will burn], [being] the carrier of firewood") or as an apposition (badal).
- حَمَّالَة is Form II active participle in the feminine form, indicating habitual/intensive action ("constant carrier").
- الْحَطَبِ refers literally to firewood she carried in this life (she spread thorns on the Prophet's path), but also symbolizes the fuel she'll carry in the Hereafter.
