<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Surah Matters for Grammar">
Al-Masad is the only surah that condemns specific individuals by name. Grammatically, it showcases an extraordinary range: dual nouns (يَدَا), feminine verb agreement (تَبَّتْ), past tense used for supplication, Form IV verbs (أَغْنَىٰ), future tense with سَـ, intensive active participles (حَمَّالَة), inverted nominal sentences, and the powerful wordplay between لَهَب (the name) and لَهَب (flame). In just 5 verses, nearly every major Arabic sentence type appears.

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | تَبَّتْ | tabbat | ت ب ب | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person feminine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni, can express a curse/prayer | Perished, ruined |
| 2 | يَدَا | yada | ي د ي | Noun - feminine dual, construct state (mudaf) | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu', dual form ends in alif) | The two hands |
| 3 | أَبِي | abi | أ ب و | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur, special declension) | Father of, Abu |
| 4 | لَهَبٍ | lahabin | ل ه ب | Proper noun - masculine, indefinite | Second part of compound name (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | Flame, Lahab |
| 5 | وَتَبَّ | wa-tabba | ت ب ب | Conjunction + verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Coordinating conjunction + past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni | And he perished |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Dual Nouns and Verb Agreement">
يَدَا is the **dual construct form** of يَد (hand). The dual in Arabic has its own declension: يَدَانِ (nominative), يَدَيْنِ (accusative/genitive). In construct state (idafah), the نِ drops: يَدَا أَبِي ("the two hands of Abu"). The verb تَبَّتْ takes the feminine marker تْ because يَدَا is grammatically feminine — Arabic verbs always agree in gender with their subject, even in the dual.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Past Tense for Supplication (Du'a)">
تَبَّتْ and تَبَّ are past tense verbs, but they don't describe completed events — they express a **curse/supplication** (du'a bi-l-sharr). Using past tense for du'a implies certainty: the destruction is so guaranteed it's described as already accomplished. This is a common Arabic pattern also seen in بَارَكَ اللهُ ("May Allah bless" — lit. "Allah blessed").
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** تَبَّتْ is the fi'l (verb), يَدَا is the fa'il (subject) in the dual nominative. أَبِي لَهَبٍ is a double idafah chain: يَدَا → أَبِي → لَهَبٍ (hands of the father of flame). The second clause وَتَبَّ has a hidden subject (هُوَ) referring to Abu Lahab himself, coordinated with وَ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَبَّ from root ت-ب-ب is a doubled root (the second and third radicals are identical). Form I with doubled roots follows the pattern فَعَّ. The feminine marker تْ is added for agreement with the feminine dual subject. أَبِي is one of the "five nouns" (الأسماء الخمسة) that decline with long vowels: أَبُو (nominative), أَبَا (accusative), أَبِي (genitive).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Mentioning "hands" (يَدَا) before the person represents synecdoche (majaz mursal) — the hands represent his entire effort and power. The repetition تَبَّتْ...وَتَبَّ moves from specific (his hands/deeds) to general (he himself), escalating the condemnation. The shift from feminine (تَبَّتْ, agreeing with يَدَا) to masculine (تَبَّ, referring to Abu Lahab) creates a grammatical crescendo.

### Verse 2

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | مَا | ma | - | Particle - negation | Negative particle (harf nafy) - mabni | Not, did not |
| 2 | أَغْنَىٰ | aghna | غ ن ي | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni | Enriched, availed, benefited |
| 3 | عَنْهُ | 'anhu | - | Preposition + attached pronoun 3rd person masculine singular | Preposition + pronoun (majrur bi-l-harf) - mabni | From him, for him |
| 4 | مَالُهُ | maluhu | م و ل | Noun - masculine singular + attached pronoun 3rd person masculine singular | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | His wealth |
| 5 | وَمَا | wa-ma | - | Conjunction + relative pronoun | Coordinating conjunction + relative pronoun (mawsul) - mabni | And what |
| 6 | كَسَبَ | kasaba | ك س ب | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni, verb of the relative clause (silat al-mawsul) | He earned, he acquired |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Two Functions of مَا">
مَا appears twice in this verse with **different functions**: (1) The first مَا is a **negation particle** (harf nafy) — "his wealth did NOT avail him." (2) The second مَا is a **relative pronoun** (ism mawsul) — "and WHAT he earned." Context determines which مَا is being used: before a verb with no logical subject, it's negation; when it can be replaced by الَّذِي, it's a relative pronoun.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** مَا negates the past tense verb أَغْنَىٰ. The fa'il (subject) is مَالُهُ, placed after the prepositional phrase عَنْهُ (a permissible reordering). The second subject is the relative clause وَمَا كَسَبَ, coordinated with مَالُهُ via وَ. The silat al-mawsul (relative clause) is كَسَبَ, with the return pronoun (عائد) implied.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَغْنَىٰ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) from root غ-ن-ي, meaning "to make rich, to suffice." Form IV adds causative meaning: غَنِيَ (to be rich) → أَغْنَى (to make rich/to avail). The alif maqsurah ending (ى) indicates a weak final radical (ي). مَال from root م-و-ل follows pattern فَعْل and means wealth or property.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse answers the implied question from verse 1: "Why is he doomed?" Two things people rely on — inherited wealth (مَالُهُ) and earned accomplishments (مَا كَسَبَ) — are declared useless. The negation مَا is emphatic, placed first in the sentence. The distinction between مَال (wealth, possibly inherited) and مَا كَسَبَ (what he earned through effort) ensures nothing is left uncovered.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سَيَصْلَىٰ نَارًا ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ"
  transliteration="sa-yasla nāran dhāta lahabin"
  translation="He will burn in a Fire of blazing flame"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | سَيَصْلَىٰ | sa-yasla | ص ل ي | Particle + verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Future particle + present tense verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') | He will burn, he will enter |
| 2 | نَارًا | naran | ن و ر | Noun - feminine singular, indefinite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) | A fire |
| 3 | ذَاتَ | dhata | - | Noun - feminine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Adjective/attribute (na't) - accusative (mansub) | Possessing, having |
| 4 | لَهَبٍ | lahabin | ل ه ب | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | Flame, blaze |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Future Tense with سَـ">
سَـ (sa) is the **near future particle**, indicating something that will happen. It attaches directly to present tense verbs: سَـ + يَصْلَى = سَيَصْلَى ("he will burn"). Compare with سَوْفَ, which also indicates future but with a sense of greater distance or emphasis. After past tense curses (v1) and past tense negation (v2), the surah shifts to future tense to describe the punishment awaiting.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** سَيَصْلَىٰ is fi'l mudari' with the future particle سَـ. The hidden subject is هُوَ (he, Abu Lahab). نَارًا is the maf'ul bihi (direct object) in the accusative. ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ is a na't (adjective) describing نَارًا — also accusative because adjectives match their described noun in case. ذَاتَ is the feminine form of ذُو (possessor), forming an idafah with لَهَبٍ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَصْلَى from root ص-ل-ي means "to burn" or "to be roasted in fire." The alif maqsurah ending indicates a weak final radical. ذَاتَ is the feminine of ذُو, one of the "five nouns" — it declines uniquely: ذَاتُ (nominative), ذَاتَ (accusative), ذَاتِ (genitive). نَار from root ن-و-ر has a hollow middle radical (و).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The devastating wordplay: Abu **لَهَب** (Flame) will burn in a fire ذَاتَ **لَهَبٍ** (possessing flame). His own name becomes his punishment. The indefiniteness of نَارًا (with tanwin) suggests an unspecified, indescribable fire — beyond what words can define. The shift from past tense (v1-2) to future (v3) creates temporal progression: his deeds are done, his wealth is useless, his punishment is certain.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَامْرَأَتُهُ حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ"
  transliteration="wa-mra'atuhu hammālata l-hatabi"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَامْرَأَتُهُ | wa-mra'atuhu | م ر أ | Conjunction + noun - feminine singular + attached pronoun 3rd person masculine singular | Coordinating conjunction + subject (mubtada' or ma'tuf 'ala fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | And his wife |
| 2 | حَمَّالَةَ | hammalata | ح م ل | Noun - feminine singular, intensive active participle (Form II pattern), construct state (mudaf) | Apposition (badal) or predicate (khabar) - accusative (mansub) | Carrier, bearer (intensive/habitual) |
| 3 | الْحَطَبِ | al-hatabi | ح ط ب | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | The firewood |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Intensive Active Participle: فَعَّالَة Pattern">
حَمَّالَة follows the pattern فَعَّالَة — the **intensive/habitual active participle** with feminine marker. Compare: حَامِلَة (فَاعِلَة, one who carries) vs. حَمَّالَة (فَعَّالَة, one who carries constantly/habitually). The intensive pattern indicates this was not a one-time action but her defining, repeated behavior. She was known for constantly carrying thorns and placing them in the Prophet's path.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَامْرَأَتُهُ can be parsed two ways: (1) coordinated with the hidden subject of سَيَصْلَىٰ — "he will burn, and his wife [will burn too]," or (2) as a new mubtada' with the following phrase as khabar. حَمَّالَةَ is in the accusative — scholars debate whether this is because it's a hal (circumstantial state), a term of censure (dhimm), or because it's governed by an implied verb.

**Sarf (Morphology):** امْرَأَة from root م-ر-أ is one of Arabic's irregular nouns — its normal form is مَرْأَة but with the prosthetic alif it becomes اِمْرَأَة. حَمَّالَة is on pattern فَعَّالَة from root ح-م-ل with gemination (shadda) on the middle radical, intensifying the meaning. الْحَطَب from root ح-ط-ب on pattern فَعَل means firewood.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Describing her as حَمَّالَةَ الْحَطَبِ works on two levels: literally, she carried thorny branches to harm the Prophet; symbolically, she will carry the fuel for her own fire in the Hereafter. The intensive pattern (فَعَّالَة) emphasizes that this was her constant occupation — her identity defined by her hostility. Not naming her directly (only "his wife") denies her individual recognition while permanently associating her with this humiliating description.

### Verse 5

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Inverted Nominal Sentence (Khabar Muqaddam)">
Normal order: حَبْلٌ فِي جِيدِهَا ("A rope is around her neck"). The Quran inverts this: **فِي جِيدِهَا** (predicate first) **حَبْلٌ** (subject second). Fronting the locative phrase emphasizes WHERE the rope is — around her neck — creating a vivid, inescapable image. The listener "sees" the neck first, then learns what's on it. This same inversion pattern appeared in Al-Kafirun 109:6 (لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence with inverted order: فِي جِيدِهَا is the khabar muqaddam (fronted predicate as a prepositional phrase), and حَبْلٌ is the mubtada' mu'akhkhar (delayed subject). مِّن مَّسَدٍ is a sifah (adjective) for حَبْلٌ, describing the material: "a rope [made] of palm fiber." The preposition مِن here indicates origin/material (min al-bayaniyyah).

**Sarf (Morphology):** جِيد from root ج-ي-د on pattern فِعْل is a rare, elevated word for "neck" — Arabic has multiple words for neck (عُنُق, رَقَبَة, جِيد), each with different connotations. جِيد specifically refers to the beautiful part of the neck where jewelry is worn. مَسَد from root م-س-د on pattern فَعَل means twisted palm fiber, the coarsest material for rope.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The word جِيد is typically used in poetry to describe a beautiful neck adorned with jewels. Using it here for the site of punishment creates savage irony — where she would have worn necklaces of pearls and gold, she will wear a rope of مَسَد (the coarsest, cheapest fiber). This is تهكم (bitter sarcasm/mockery) through elevated vocabulary applied to a degrading image. The surah ends on this stark visual, searing the image into memory.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Verse 1 contains two instances of the verb تَبَّ — one feminine (تَبَّتْ) and one masculine (تَبَّ). Explain why the gender changes and what each form refers to.">

**تَبَّتْ (feminine):**
- The feminine marker تْ is required because the subject is يَدَا (two hands), which is grammatically feminine in Arabic
- يَد (hand) is a feminine noun, and its dual يَدَا retains feminine gender
- This refers to Abu Lahab's **hands** (representing his deeds and efforts)

**وَتَبَّ (masculine):**
- No feminine marker — this is the default masculine 3rd person form
- The hidden subject is هُوَ (he), referring to Abu Lahab **himself**
- This moves from his actions (hands) to his entire being

**The progression:**
First, his deeds are condemned (تَبَّتْ يَدَا = "may his hands perish"). Then he himself is condemned (وَتَبَّ = "and may he perish"). The grammatical gender shift from feminine to masculine reflects a rhetorical escalation from the specific (his efforts) to the total (his entire self). The verb agreement is not arbitrary — it follows the strict Arabic rule that verbs must match their subjects in gender.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="The word لَهَب appears twice in this surah — in verse 1 as part of the name أَبِي لَهَبٍ and in verse 3 as ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ. Analyze the grammatical function of لَهَبٍ in each instance and explain the rhetorical effect of this repetition.">

**Verse 1 — أَبِي لَهَبٍ:**
- **Function:** Second mudaf ilayhi in a double idafah chain (يَدَا ← أَبِي ← لَهَبٍ)
- **Case:** Genitive (majrur) because it's the mudaf ilayhi
- **Meaning:** Part of the proper name "Abu Lahab" (Father of Flame) — his kunya/nickname

**Verse 3 — ذَاتَ لَهَبٍ:**
- **Function:** Mudaf ilayhi governed by ذَاتَ in an adjectival idafah
- **Case:** Genitive (majrur) because it's the mudaf ilayhi
- **Meaning:** "possessing flame" — describes the type of fire he'll enter

**Rhetorical effect (tajnis):**
This is called **tajnis** (paronomasia/wordplay) — using the same word with different meanings or functions. Abu "Lahab" (Flame) will enter a fire "dhata lahab" (possessing flame). His own name becomes his sentence. The Quran turns his identity against him: the man named after flame will be consumed by flame. This is among the most striking examples of wordplay in the Quran, where grammar and rhetoric merge to deliver devastating irony.
