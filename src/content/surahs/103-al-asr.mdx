# Al-ʿAsr (Time)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 3
- **Theme:** The surah emphasizes that all of humanity is in loss except those who believe, do righteous deeds, and encourage one another to truth and patience.
- **Grammar Focus:** Oath construction with وَ (wa), nominal sentence structure, exceptive particle إِلَّا (illa), relative clauses with الَّذِينَ (alladhina)

### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | وَالْعَصْرِ | Oath | وَ + genitive noun | Swearing by time |
| 2 | إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ | Nominal (emphatic) | إِنَّ + لَ emphasis | Universal loss |
| 3 | إِلَّا الَّذِينَ آمَنُوا... | Exception clause | إِلَّا + relative clause | Four conditions of salvation |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Surah Matters for Grammar">
Imam al-Shafi'i said: "If people reflected on this surah alone, it would suffice them." In just 3 verses and 14 words, Al-ʿAsr demonstrates oath construction, emphatic particles, exception clauses, relative pronouns, and verb form patterns — making it a grammar treasure.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample

  transliteration="wa-l-ʿaṣri"
  translation="By time"
  reference="Al-ʿAsr 103:1"
  highlight="وَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "By" },
    { ar: "الْعَصْرِ", tr: "al-ʿaṣr", en: "time, afternoon" }

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - oath prefix | Oath particle (harf al-qasam) - not declinable (mabni) | By |
| 2 | الْعَصْرِ | al-ʿaṣr | ع ص ر | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Object of oath (muqsam bihi) - genitive (majrur) with kasra | time, afternoon |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Oath Particles and the Genitive Case">
The وَ (wa) here is an oath particle, not a conjunction. Oath particles (وَ، بِ، تَ) always place the following noun in the genitive case (majrur). Notice الْعَصْرِ ends with kasra, confirming the genitive.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is an oath construction (jumlat al-qasam). The وَ is a harf al-qasam governing the genitive. The object of the oath (muqsam bihi) is الْعَصْرِ, and the response to the oath (jawab al-qasam) follows in verse 2.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْعَصْرِ from root ع-ص-ر on the pattern فَعْل carries meanings of pressing, squeezing, and by extension time/epoch — something that presses upon and passes through existence.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Allah swears by time itself, elevating it as a witness. The brevity of the oath — just two words — mirrors the brevity of time, the very thing being sworn by. The definite article الـ indicates THE time (all of it), not just a moment.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ الْإِنسَانَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ"
  transliteration="inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin"
  translation="Indeed, mankind is in loss"
  reference="Al-ʿAsr 103:2"
  highlight="إِنَّ,لَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّ", tr: "inna", en: "indeed" },
    { ar: "الْإِنسَانَ", tr: "al-insāna", en: "mankind, humanity" },
    { ar: "لَ", tr: "la", en: "surely" },
    { ar: "فِي", tr: "fī", en: "in" },
    { ar: "خُسْرٍ", tr: "khusrin", en: "loss" }

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّ | inna | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (harf tawkid) - governs accusative | indeed |
| 2 | الْإِنسَانَ | al-insāna | ا ن س | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Subject of inna (ism inna) - accusative (mansub) with fatha | mankind, humanity |
| 3 | لَ | la | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis prefix particle (lam al-tawkid) - not declinable | surely |
| 4 | فِي | fī | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition - not declinable (mabni) | in |
| 5 | خُسْرٍ | khusrin | خ س ر | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Object of preposition (majrur) - genitive with tanwin kasra | loss |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Emphasis: إِنَّ + لَ">
This verse uses TWO layers of emphasis: إِنَّ at the beginning and لَ before the predicate. In Arabic rhetoric, stacking emphasis particles signals that the audience may doubt or resist the claim. The message — that mankind is in loss — is presented as an undeniable truth requiring double reinforcement.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِنَّ is from the nawasikh (particles that override default case). It makes the subject accusative (الْإِنسَانَ → manṣūb) while the predicate remains nominative in position. The predicate (khabar inna) is the prepositional phrase فِي خُسْرٍ, placed in the position of nominative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْإِنسَانَ from root ا-ن-س on pattern فِعْلَان carries connotations of sociability and forgetfulness. خُسْرٍ from root خ-س-ر on pattern فُعْل means loss, ruin — a concrete noun used abstractly.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The indefiniteness of خُسْرٍ (no الـ, with tanwin) is deliberate — it indicates absolute, unspecified loss. Not a particular kind of loss, but loss in its totality. The definite الْإِنسَانَ (with الـ for the genus) means ALL of mankind without exception — until the exception comes in verse 3.

### Verse 3

  transliteration="illā lladhīna āmanū wa-ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāti wa-tawāṣaw bi-l-ḥaqqi wa-tawāṣaw bi-ṣ-ṣabri"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form VI: The Mutual Action Pattern">
تَوَاصَوْا is a Form VI verb (تَفَاعَلَ pattern) from root و-ص-ي. Form VI indicates mutual/reciprocal action — "they counseled **each other**." This is not one person advising another, but a community where everyone both gives and receives counsel. The grammar itself encodes the Islamic principle of collective responsibility.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِلَّا introduces a connected exception (istithna muttasil) from the general statement in verse 2. الَّذِينَ is a relative pronoun serving as the excepted noun (mustathna). Four verbs in the relative clause describe the excepted group, linked by coordinating وَ. The sound feminine plural الصَّالِحَاتِ takes kasra as its accusative marker (a special rule for sound feminine plurals).

**Sarf (Morphology):** The verb forms reveal a progression: آمَنُوا (Form IV — causative: to cause belief in oneself), عَمِلُوا (Form I — basic action), تَوَاصَوْا (Form VI — mutual action). The shift from individual acts (believing, doing) to communal acts (mutual counsel) reflects the surah's movement from personal to collective responsibility.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The four conditions are structured as two pairs:
1. **Internal:** belief (آمَنُوا) + action (عَمِلُوا) — personal faith and deeds
2. **External:** truth-counsel (تَوَاصَوْا بِالْحَقِّ) + patience-counsel (تَوَاصَوْا بِالصَّبْرِ) — communal responsibility

The repetition of تَوَاصَوْا creates rhythmic emphasis: advising to truth is not enough without also advising to patience in upholding that truth. The parallelism (وَ...وَ...وَ) builds a cumulative structure where removing any one condition breaks the chain of salvation.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the case of each noun in verses 1-2 and explain WHY each noun has that case (what grammatical element governs it).">

**Verse 1:**
- **الْعَصْرِ** — Genitive (majrur), governed by the oath particle وَ. All oath particles place the following noun in the genitive case.

**Verse 2:**
- **الْإِنسَانَ** — Accusative (mansub), governed by إِنَّ. The particle إِنَّ overrides the default nominative of the subject, making it accusative.
- **خُسْرٍ** — Genitive (majrur), governed by the preposition فِي. Prepositions always place the following noun in the genitive case.

**Key insight:** Each noun's case is determined by a specific grammatical governor (عامل): oath particle → genitive, إِنَّ → accusative, preposition → genitive. No noun is nominative in these two verses.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="The verb تَوَاصَوْا (Form VI) appears twice in verse 3. Why does the Quran use a Form VI verb here instead of a simpler Form I verb like وَصَى (he advised)?">

Form VI (تَفَاعَلَ) inherently encodes **mutual/reciprocal action** — "they advised **each other**," not "they advised others."

If the Quran used the Form I وَصَى, it would mean one-directional advising (a teacher to a student). Form VI تَوَاصَوْا means every member of the group is simultaneously an advisor and one being advised.

This grammatical choice carries theological weight:
- **No hierarchy** — everyone participates equally in counsel
- **Continuous exchange** — not a one-time event but ongoing mutual support
- **Community obligation** — salvation requires collective, not just individual, effort

The morphological pattern (تَفَاعَلَ) is itself the theological message: Islam is not a solitary practice.
