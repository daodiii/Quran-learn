<Callout type="tip" title="A Masterclass in Verb Forms and Rhetorical Parallelism">
Al-A'la is exceptional for grammar study because it showcases nearly every major Arabic verb form in action: Form I (khalaqa, hada), Form II intensive (sabbih, sawwa, qaddara, dhakkir, salla), Form IV causative (akhraja, aflaha, nuqri'u, tu'thirun), and Form V reflexive (yadhdhakkaru, tazakka, yatajannab). The surah is built on elegant parallel structures -- paired divine actions (khalaqa fa-sawwa, qaddara fa-hada), contrasting human responses (man yakhsha vs al-ashqa), and root wordplay (yassara/yusra, dhakkir/dhikra) -- making it one of the richest surahs for understanding how Arabic morphology carries meaning.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سَبِّحِ اسْمَ رَبِّكَ الْأَعْلَىٰ"
  transliteration="sabbihi isma rabbika al-a'laa"
  translation="Glorify the name of your Lord, the Most High"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:1"
  highlight="سَبِّحِ,الْأَعْلَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "سَبِّحِ", tr: "sabbih", en: "glorify" }, { ar: "اسْمَ", tr: "isma", en: "the name" }, { ar: "رَبِّكَ", tr: "rabbika", en: "your Lord" }, { ar: "الْأَعْلَىٰ", tr: "al-a'laa", en: "the Most High" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | سَبِّحِ | sabbih | س ب ح | Verb - Form II, imperative, 2nd person, masculine, singular | Imperative verb - majzum (understood) | glorify |
| 2 | اسْمَ | isma | س م و | Noun - masculine, singular, construct state | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) | the name |
| 3 | رَبِّكَ | rabbika | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + pronoun | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) + possessive | your Lord |
| 4 | الْأَعْلَىٰ | al-a'laa | ع ل و | Noun - elative/superlative, masculine, singular, definite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | the Most High |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form II Imperative and Idafa Construction">
- **sabbih**: Form II imperative -- command to glorify/exalt. The doubled middle radical (ب) signals the intensive meaning of Form II.
- **ism rabbika**: Idafa construction -- "the name of your Lord" = Allah and His attributes. The first noun (ism) is mansub as maf'ul bihi and in construct state (no tanwin, no alif-lam).
- **al-a'la**: Superlative form (ism al-tafdil) on the af'al pattern -- the Highest, Supreme. It follows rabbika as an adjective (na't) in genitive case.
- Opening with a command establishes the surah's theme: exaltation of Allah.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The sentence is a verbal imperative clause. The verb sabbih governs the direct object isma (mansub), which heads an idafa chain: isma rabbika. Al-a'la functions as a na't (adjective) for rabbika, taking genitive case to match. The entire clause is a command directed at the Prophet (2nd person masculine singular).

**Sarf (Morphology):** sabbih is Form II (fa''ala) imperative -- the tashdid on the ba' signals intensive/causative meaning: "declare glory repeatedly and thoroughly." The root is س-ب-ح. Al-a'la follows the af'al superlative pattern from root ع-ل-و, with the final alif maqsura characteristic of defective roots.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with an imperative creates immediate engagement -- the surah begins with action, not description. The choice of sabbih (glorify/exalt) rather than a simple u'budh (worship) emphasizes the active verbal dimension of praise. The superlative al-a'la placed at the end of the verse creates a climactic effect, building from action (glorify) to object (the name of your Lord) to the ultimate attribute (the Most High).

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي خَلَقَ فَسَوَّىٰ"
  transliteration="alladhi khalaqa fa-sawwaa"
  translation="Who created and proportioned"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:2"
  highlight="خَلَقَ,فَسَوَّىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "الَّذِي", tr: "alladhi", en: "Who" }, { ar: "خَلَقَ", tr: "khalaqa", en: "He created" }, { ar: "فَ", tr: "fa", en: "then" }, { ar: "سَوَّىٰ", tr: "sawwa", en: "He proportioned" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | الَّذِي | alladhi | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (ism mawsul) referring to al-a'la | Who |
| 2 | خَلَقَ | khalaqa | خ ل ق | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Verb in relative clause | He created |
| 3 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Sequential conjunction | then |
| 4 | سَوَّىٰ | sawwa | س و ي | Verb - Form II, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Verb in sequence | He proportioned |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Relative Clause and Sequential Fa">
- **alladhi**: Relative pronoun describing Allah (al-a'la). It begins a series of relative clauses (verses 2-4) that elaborate on Allah's attributes.
- **khalaqa fa-sawwa**: Created then proportioned -- two-stage process linked by the sequential fa (fa al-ta'qib), indicating the second action followed immediately.
- **Form II sawwa**: Intensive meaning -- made perfectly proportioned/balanced. The doubling signals thoroughness and completeness in the act of proportioning.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Alladhi introduces a relative clause (silat al-mawsul) modifying the antecedent al-a'la from verse 1. The relative clause contains two verbal sentences connected by fa. The subject of both verbs is the hidden pronoun huwa referring to Allah. No explicit objects are mentioned, leaving the scope universal -- "He created [everything] and proportioned [it]."

**Sarf (Morphology):** khalaqa is Form I (fa'ala) -- the basic creation verb. sawwa is Form II (fa''ala) with the doubled waw, carrying the intensive meaning of making something balanced, even, and perfectly proportioned. The alif maqsura ending on sawwa comes from the defective root س-و-ي.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The pairing of khalaqa (simple creation) with sawwa (perfecting/proportioning) presents creation as a two-step process: first bringing into existence, then refining to perfection. The omission of objects (what was created, what was proportioned) universalizes the statement -- Allah did this to ALL creation. This verse begins a rhetorical pattern of paired divine actions that continues through verses 3 and 4.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالَّذِي قَدَّرَ فَهَدَىٰ"
  transliteration="walladhi qaddara fa-hadaa"
  translation="And who destined and guided"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:3"
  highlight="قَدَّرَ,فَهَدَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "and" }, { ar: "الَّذِي", tr: "alladhi", en: "Who" }, { ar: "قَدَّرَ", tr: "qaddara", en: "He destined/measured" }, { ar: "فَ", tr: "fa", en: "then" }, { ar: "هَدَىٰ", tr: "hada", en: "He guided" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | الَّذِي | alladhi | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (ism mawsul) | Who |
| 3 | قَدَّرَ | qaddara | ق د ر | Verb - Form II, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Verb in relative clause | He destined/measured |
| 4 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Sequential conjunction | then |
| 5 | هَدَىٰ | hada | ه د ي | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Verb in sequence | He guided |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Parallel Structure and Form II Precision">
- **qaddara**: Form II -- determined/measured/decreed with precision. The doubled dal intensifies the meaning: not just decreeing but decreeing with exact measure and purpose.
- **fa-hada**: Then guided -- after determining each creation's nature, He provided guidance to fulfil that nature.
- Parallel structure to verse 2 (two-stage divine action): verse 2 = created + proportioned, verse 3 = destined + guided.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The structure mirrors verse 2 exactly: wa + alladhi + past verb + fa + past verb. The coordinating wa links this relative clause to the previous one, continuing the description of Allah's attributes. Both verbs take hidden subjects (huwa) and omit explicit objects.

**Sarf (Morphology):** qaddara is Form II (fa''ala) from root ق-د-ر, with the doubled dal indicating precision and thoroughness in measurement. hada is Form I (fa'ala) from the defective root ه-د-ي, with the alif maqsura ending. The contrast between Form II (intensive) and Form I (simple) is meaningful: the decreeing is intensive and precise, while the guidance flows naturally from it.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The parallelism between verses 2 and 3 creates a rhetorical escalation: verse 2 addresses physical creation (created/proportioned), verse 3 addresses purposeful destiny (measured/guided). The progression moves from the material to the teleological -- not only did Allah make things, He gave them purpose and direction. The omission of objects again universalizes: every creature was given its measure and guided accordingly.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالَّذِي أَخْرَجَ الْمَرْعَىٰ"
  transliteration="walladhi akhraja al-mar'aa"
  translation="And who brings out the pasture"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:4"
  highlight="أَخْرَجَ,الْمَرْعَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "and" }, { ar: "الَّذِي", tr: "alladhi", en: "Who" }, { ar: "أَخْرَجَ", tr: "akhraja", en: "He brought out" }, { ar: "الْمَرْعَىٰ", tr: "al-mar'aa", en: "the pasture" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | الَّذِي | alladhi | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (ism mawsul) | Who |
| 3 | أَخْرَجَ | akhraja | خ ر ج | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Verb in relative clause | He brought out |
| 4 | الْمَرْعَىٰ | al-mar'aa | ر ع ي | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) | the pasture |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IV Causative and Concrete Illustration">
- **akhraja**: Form IV (af'ala) -- causative -- made to come out (vegetation from earth). The hamza prefix converts the intransitive kharaja (went out) into the transitive/causative akhraja (brought out).
- **al-mar'a**: Pasture/grazing land -- vegetation for animals. The maf'al pattern indicates a place noun (where grazing happens).
- This verse shifts from abstract divine attributes (creating, proportioning, guiding) to a concrete, observable example of divine provision in nature.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Same relative clause structure as verses 2-3, but here the verb takes an explicit object: al-mar'a (accusative/mansub). This is the third in a series of relative clauses beginning with alladhi, all serving as adjectives for al-a'la in verse 1.

**Sarf (Morphology):** akhraja is Form IV (af'ala) from root خ-ر-ج. The hamza prefix is the hallmark of Form IV causative: kharaja (he went out) becomes akhraja (he made [something] come out). al-mar'a follows the maf'al pattern from root ر-ع-ي, functioning as an ism makan (place noun) meaning "place of grazing/pasture."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After three verses of abstract, universal statements about creation, destiny, and guidance, verse 4 grounds the discourse in a tangible image: green pasture emerging from the earth. This rhetorical descent from the cosmic to the concrete makes the divine power relatable and observable. The choice of vegetation specifically prepares for verse 5's imagery of decay.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَجَعَلَهُ غُثَاءً أَحْوَىٰ"
  transliteration="fa-ja'alahu ghuthaa'an ahwaa"
  translation="And makes it dark debris"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:5"
  highlight="غُثَاءً,أَحْوَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "فَ", tr: "fa", en: "then" }, { ar: "جَعَلَهُ", tr: "ja'alahu", en: "He made it" }, { ar: "غُثَاءً", tr: "ghuthaa'an", en: "debris/stubble" }, { ar: "أَحْوَىٰ", tr: "ahwa", en: "dark/blackish" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Sequential conjunction | then |
| 2 | جَعَلَهُ | ja'alahu | ج ع ل | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular + pronoun | Verb with object pronoun | He made it |
| 3 | غُثَاءً | ghuthaa'an | غ ث ث | Noun - masculine, singular, indefinite | Second object (maf'ul bihi thani) - accusative (mansub) | debris/stubble |
| 4 | أَحْوَىٰ | ahwa | ح و ي | Noun - adjective, masculine, singular, indefinite | Adjective (na't) - accusative (mansub) | dark/blackish |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double-Object Verb and the Cycle of Life">
- **ja'alahu**: Verb of transformation (ja'ala) taking two objects -- the first is the attached pronoun -hu (it, referring to al-mar'a), and the second is ghuthaa'an (debris). This construction means "He made it [into] debris."
- **ghuthaa' ahwa**: Dark debris -- dried, blackened vegetation. The adjective ahwa (dark/blackish) follows the af'al color/defect pattern.
- Cycle of life: fresh green pasture transforms into withered dark debris -- a sign of Allah's power over life and death.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The fa connects this to verse 4 sequentially. ja'ala here functions as a verb of transformation (ja'ala al-tahwiliyyah), taking two objects: the first object is the pronoun -hu (accusative), and the second object is ghuthaa'an (accusative). ahwa is an adjective (na't) modifying ghuthaa'an, also in the accusative case.

**Sarf (Morphology):** ghuthaa' follows the fu'al pattern from root غ-ث-ث, referring to dried plant matter/scum. ahwa follows the af'al color/defect pattern from root ح-و-ي, indicating a dark, blackish-green color. Both are rare Quranic vocabulary, adding vividness and specificity to the imagery.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The juxtaposition of al-mar'a (lush green pasture in verse 4) with ghuthaa'an ahwa (dark debris in verse 5) creates a powerful visual contrast. The sequential fa emphasizes the inevitability of this transformation -- what Allah causes to grow, He also causes to wither. This serves as a memento mori: the beauty and vitality of worldly life will similarly fade, preparing for the later contrast between dunya and akhira (verses 16-17).

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سَنُقْرِئُكَ فَلَا تَنسَىٰ"
  transliteration="sa-nuqri'uka fa-laa tansaa"
  translation="We will make you recite, and you will not forget"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:6"
  highlight="سَنُقْرِئُكَ,تَنسَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "سَ", tr: "sa", en: "will" }, { ar: "نُقْرِئُكَ", tr: "nuqri'uka", en: "We make you recite" }, { ar: "فَ", tr: "fa", en: "so" }, { ar: "لَا", tr: "laa", en: "not" }, { ar: "تَنسَىٰ", tr: "tansa", en: "you will forget" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | سَ | sa | - | Particle - future | Future prefix (seen al-istiqbal) | will |
| 2 | نُقْرِئُكَ | nuqri'uka | ق ر أ | Verb - Form IV, present tense, 1st person, plural + pronoun | Future verb with object pronoun - indicative (marfu') | We make you recite |
| 3 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - result | Result conjunction | so |
| 4 | لَا | laa | - | Particle - negation | Negation particle (harf nafy) | not |
| 5 | تَنسَىٰ | tansa | ن س ي | Verb - Form I, present tense, 2nd person, masculine, singular | Present verb - indicative (marfu') | you will forget |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Future Tense and Person Shift">
- **sa-nuqri'uka**: Future tense with Form IV causative -- "We will cause you to recite." The sa- prefix marks definite future, and the nun prefix indicates first person plural (royal We/divine plural).
- **fa-la tansa**: Negative result -- "so you will not forget." The fa here is fa al-sababiyyah (causal fa), connecting cause (divine teaching) to effect (no forgetting).
- This verse marks a dramatic shift from 3rd person (describing Allah's attributes in verses 1-5) to 1st person plural (Allah speaking directly), creating intimacy and directness.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The sentence structure shifts from descriptive relative clauses to a direct promise. sa- + present verb creates the future tense. The verb nuqri'u takes a direct object pronoun -ka (you). The result clause fa-la tansa uses la as a negation particle (not jussive la), keeping the verb in indicative mood (marfu').

**Sarf (Morphology):** nuqri'u is Form IV (uf'ilu) from root ق-ر-أ, the causative form: "to cause to read/recite." The hamza of the root appears at the end. tansa is Form I from the defective root ن-س-ي, with the ya' dropping in the present tense form.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from third person to first person plural (iltifat) is a powerful rhetorical device. Verses 1-5 described Allah in the third person; now Allah speaks directly. This iltifat creates immediacy and intimacy -- the promise of Quranic preservation comes as a direct, personal assurance to the Prophet. The future tense with sa- (rather than sawfa) suggests nearness and certainty.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَّا مَا شَاءَ اللَّهُ ۚ إِنَّهُ يَعْلَمُ الْجَهْرَ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ"
  transliteration="illaa maa shaa'a Allahu innahu ya'lamu al-jahra wa maa yakhfaa"
  translation="Except what Allah wills. Indeed, He knows what is open and what is hidden"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:7"
  highlight="إِلَّا,الْجَهْرَ"
  words={[{ ar: "إِلَّا", tr: "illa", en: "except" }, { ar: "مَا", tr: "ma", en: "what" }, { ar: "شَاءَ", tr: "shaa'a", en: "He willed" }, { ar: "اللَّهُ", tr: "Allah", en: "Allah" }, { ar: "إِنَّهُ", tr: "innahu", en: "indeed He" }, { ar: "يَعْلَمُ", tr: "ya'lamu", en: "He knows" }, { ar: "الْجَهْرَ", tr: "al-jahra", en: "the open/manifest" }, { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "and" }, { ar: "مَا", tr: "ma", en: "what" }, { ar: "يَخْفَىٰ", tr: "yakhfa", en: "is hidden" }]}

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Exception Clause and Merism (Opposite Pairs)">
- **illa ma shaa' Allah**: Exception clause -- all is preserved except what Allah wills to abrogate. The particle illa introduces the exception, and ma shaa'a is a relative clause serving as the excepted element (mustathna).
- **al-jahr wa ma yakhfa**: The manifest and the hidden -- a merism (tibaq) using opposites to mean "everything." By mentioning both extremes, the Quran expresses totality: Allah knows absolutely everything.
- This verse affirms Allah's comprehensive knowledge with double emphasis (inna + the merism construction).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse contains two distinct sentences. The first is an exception clause (istithnaa') modifying the previous verse's promise. The second begins with inna (emphasis particle), which takes a pronoun -hu as its ism (accusative) and the entire verbal clause ya'lamu al-jahra wa ma yakhfa as its khabar. The relative clause ma yakhfa parallels the definite noun al-jahra.

**Sarf (Morphology):** shaa'a is Form I from the hollow root ش-ي-أ, with the long alif appearing in the past tense. ya'lamu is Form I from ع-ل-م. yakhfa is Form I from the defective root خ-ف-ي, with the ya' manifesting as alif maqsura.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The exception clause (illa ma shaa'a Allah) serves a theological purpose: it preserves divine sovereignty even within a promise. The merism (al-jahra wa ma yakhfa) is a masterful rhetorical device -- rather than saying "He knows everything," the verse names the two extremes (open/hidden) to encompass everything between. Note the asymmetry: al-jahra is a simple definite noun, while ma yakhfa is a relative clause -- the hidden things are expressed through a more elaborate construction, perhaps reflecting their greater mystery.

### Verse 8

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 2 | نُيَسِّرُكَ | nuyassiruka | ي س ر | Verb - Form II, present tense, 1st person, plural + pronoun | Present verb with object pronoun - indicative (marfu') | We will ease you |
| 3 | لِ | li | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | toward |
| 4 | الْيُسْرَىٰ | al-yusra | ي س ر | Noun - elative/superlative feminine form, definite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | the ease/easiest way |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Root Wordplay: يسر in Verb and Noun">
- **nuyassiru**: Form II (fa''ala) -- make easy/facilitate. The doubled sin intensifies the meaning: "to thoroughly ease."
- **li-al-yusra**: Toward the easiest way -- the path of Islam and righteousness. al-yusra follows the fu'la superlative feminine pattern.
- The verse features elegant wordplay from the same root ي-س-ر: the verb yassara (to ease) leads to the noun yusra (ease). The sound echoes reinforce the meaning: ease upon ease.
- Promise: Allah facilitates the Prophet's mission with effortless grace.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence coordinated with the previous verse's promise. The verb nuyassiru takes a direct object pronoun -ka and a prepositional phrase li-al-yusra indicating direction/purpose. The li preposition here expresses purpose or destination (lam al-ghayah).

**Sarf (Morphology):** Both nuyassiru and al-yusra derive from root ي-س-ر. nuyassiru is Form II present (nufa''ilu), with the doubled sin marking intensive/causative meaning. al-yusra follows the fu'la pattern, the feminine superlative form, meaning "the easiest/most easy way."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The jinas (paronomasia/wordplay) between nuyassiru and al-yusra creates a rhetorical echo: the meaning of ease is reinforced by the sound of ease. Using the same root in both verb and object (cognate accusative-like construction with preposition) emphasizes that every aspect of this promise revolves around ease. This stands in contrast to the later criticism of those who make things hard on themselves by preferring dunya (verse 16).

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَذَكِّرْ إِن نَّفَعَتِ الذِّكْرَىٰ"
  transliteration="fa-dhakkir in nafa'ati al-dhikraa"
  translation="So remind, if the reminder benefits"

| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - result | Result conjunction | so |
| 2 | ذَكِّرْ | dhakkir | ذ ك ر | Verb - Form II, imperative, 2nd person, masculine, singular | Imperative verb - majzum (understood) | remind |
| 3 | إِن | in | - | Particle - conditional | Conditional particle (harf shart) | if |
| 4 | نَفَعَتِ | nafa'ati | ن ف ع | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person, feminine, singular | Past verb in conditional clause | it benefited |
| 5 | الذِّكْرَىٰ | al-dhikra | ذ ك ر | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | the reminder |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Conditional Clause and Root Wordplay">
- **dhakkir**: Form II imperative -- remind/admonish. The doubled kaf signals intensive/causative meaning: "make someone remember."
- **in nafa'at**: Conditional clause with in (lighter conditional than idha) -- "if it benefits." The past tense verb in the conditional has future meaning.
- Understood meaning: Remind in all cases, for the reminder always benefits those who will heed. The conditional is not restrictive but rhetorical.
- **Root wordplay**: dhakkir (remind) and al-dhikra (the reminder) share root ذ-ك-ر, creating a figure of speech known as jinas ishtiqaqi (derivational paronomasia).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse begins with fa (result conjunction) linking back to the promise of ease. The main clause is the imperative dhakkir. The conditional clause in nafa'at al-dhikra uses in + past tense verb (which takes future meaning in conditional constructions). The verb nafa'at is feminine because its subject al-dhikra is feminine.

**Sarf (Morphology):** dhakkir is Form II imperative from root ذ-ك-ر, with the doubled kaf. al-dhikra is a masdar (verbal noun) on the fi'la/dhikra pattern from the same root. nafa'at shows the ta' marbuta feminine marker on the past tense verb, agreeing with the feminine subject.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The conditional "if the reminder benefits" is not a genuine restriction (taqyid) but rather a rhetorical device (ihtiraz) -- scholars explain that the reminder always benefits the willing heart, so the Prophet is commanded to remind regardless. The jinas between dhakkir and al-dhikra creates phonetic cohesion and reinforces the central theme. This verse returns to the imperative mood of verse 1, framing the middle section (verses 2-8 on Allah's attributes and promises) within a framework of action.

### Verse 10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سَيَذَّكَّرُ مَن يَخْشَىٰ"
  transliteration="sa-yadhdhakkaru man yakhshaa"
  translation="He who fears will remember"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | سَ | sa | - | Particle - future | Future prefix (seen al-istiqbal) | will |
| 2 | يَذَّكَّرُ | yadhdhakkaru | ذ ك ر | Verb - Form V, present tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Future verb - indicative (marfu') | he will remember |
| 3 | مَن | man | - | Pronoun - relative/conditional | Relative pronoun (ism mawsul) | whoever/he who |
| 4 | يَخْشَىٰ | yakhsha | خ ش ي | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Present verb in relative clause | he fears |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form V Reflexive: Taking Heed for Oneself">
- **sa-yadhdhakkaru**: Form V (tafa''ala) reflexive -- "will take heed/remember for himself." The ta- prefix with doubled middle radical signals that the action benefits the subject himself. Originally yatadhakkaru, the ta' assimilates with the dhal.
- **man yakhsha**: Whoever fears (Allah) -- the relative pronoun man creates a general/conditional statement applicable to anyone.
- Those with reverential fear (khashya) of Allah will benefit from the reminder -- linking fear (taqwa) to receptiveness.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verb sa-yadhdhakkaru is future tense (sa- + present). Its subject is the relative clause man yakhsha, where man functions as a relative pronoun (ism mawsul). The verb yakhsha in the relative clause takes a hidden object (Allah is implied). The entire structure is: "The one who fears [Allah] will remember."

**Sarf (Morphology):** yadhdhakkaru is Form V (yatafa''alu) from root ذ-ك-ر. The expected form yatadhakkaru undergoes assimilation (idgham): the ta' of Form V merges with the dhal, producing the doubled dhal sound. yakhsha is Form I from the defective root خ-ش-ي.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse answers the implicit question raised by verse 9's conditional: "Who will benefit from the reminder?" The answer: those who possess khashya (reverential awe). The sa- prefix adds certainty to the future -- this is not a mere possibility but a divine assurance. The verse also continues the ذ-ك-ر root chain: dhakkir (v9) -> al-dhikra (v9) -> yadhdhakkaru (v10), creating a triple echo.

### Verse 11

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَيَتَجَنَّبُهَا الْأَشْقَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa yatajannabuha al-ashqaa"
  translation="But the most wretched will avoid it"

| 3 | الْأَشْقَىٰ | al-ashqa | ش ق ي | Noun - elative/superlative, masculine, singular, definite | Subject (fa'il) - nominative (marfu') | the most wretched |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Contrast: Form V Reflexive and Superlative Subject">
- **yatajannab**: Form V (tafa''ala) -- avoid/shun (reflexive intensive). The ta- prefix indicates the subject performs the action on/for himself: "he removes himself from."
- **al-ashqa**: Superlative (ism al-tafdil) on the af'al pattern -- the most miserable/wretched. The definite article identifies this as a specific category of person.
- Stark contrast with verse 10: the fearful ones heed (yadhdhakkaru) vs. the wretched ones avoid (yatajannabuha).
- Object pronoun -ha refers to al-dhikra (the reminder) from verse 9.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verb yatajannabuha takes the pronoun -ha as its direct object (referring to al-dhikra) and al-ashqa as its delayed subject (fa'il mu'akhkhar). The subject is placed after the verb and object, which is the standard VSO word order in Arabic but here the delay of the subject adds emphasis to the identity of the avoider.

**Sarf (Morphology):** yatajannabu is Form V (yatafa''alu) from root ج-ن-ب (side/flank), meaning "to put oneself to the side of, to avoid." al-ashqa follows the af'al superlative pattern from root ش-ق-ي (wretchedness), with the alif maqsura ending from the defective root.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The wa here functions adversatively (contrasting with the previous verse), creating a sharp binary: those who fear and remember vs. those who are wretched and avoid. The choice of Form V yatajannab (to actively remove oneself) rather than a simpler verb of avoidance emphasizes the deliberateness of the rejection -- the wretched one doesn't merely fail to hear but actively puts distance between himself and the reminder. The superlative al-ashqa (the MOST wretched) intensifies the condemnation.

### Verse 12

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِي يَصْلَى النَّارَ الْكُبْرَىٰ"
  transliteration="alladhi yasla al-naara al-kubraa"
  translation="Who will enter the greatest Fire"

| 3 | النَّارَ | al-naara | ن و ر | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) | the Fire |
| 4 | الْكُبْرَىٰ | al-kubra | ك ب ر | Noun - elative/superlative feminine, definite | Adjective (na't) - accusative (mansub) | the greatest |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Relative Clause Identifying the Wretched">
- **yasla al-nar**: To enter/burn in the Fire -- this verb specifically means to be exposed to and burned by fire.
- **al-kubra**: Superlative feminine (fu'la pattern) -- the greatest (fire). The feminine form agrees with the feminine noun al-nar.
- This relative clause describes the fate of al-ashqa (the most wretched) who actively avoided the reminder.
- The definite article on both al-nar and al-kubra indicates a specific, known fire -- the Fire of the Hereafter.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Alladhi introduces a relative clause (silat al-mawsul) describing al-ashqa from verse 11. The verb yasla takes al-naara as its direct object (mansub). al-kubra is a na't (adjective) for al-naara, in the accusative case matching its described noun. Both noun and adjective are definite (with alif-lam).

**Sarf (Morphology):** yasla is Form I from the defective root ص-ل-ي, meaning to be exposed to fire/burn. al-kubra follows the fu'la superlative feminine pattern from root ك-ب-ر, matching the feminine gender of al-nar.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The continuation from verse 11 through a relative clause creates a cascading sentence of condemnation: the most wretched avoids the reminder -- who will burn in the greatest Fire. The use of al-kubra (greatest/biggest) implies degrees of punishment and specifies the most severe. The present tense yasla with future meaning creates immediacy -- as if the punishment is already unfolding before the listener's eyes.

### Verse 13

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ثُمَّ لَا يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَىٰ"
  transliteration="thumma laa yamuutu fiiha wa laa yahyaa"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Negation and Paradoxical State">
- **la yamut... wa la yahya**: Neither dies nor lives -- double negation (la... wa la) creating a comprehensive denial of both states.
- This paradoxical state describes the torment of Hell -- perpetual suffering without the relief of death or the comfort of true life.
- The most severe punishment: existence without either end (death) or fulfilment (life).
- This is a merism of negation: by denying both extremes, it describes an impossible, agonizing middle state.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** thumma (then, subsequently) connects this to the previous verse, adding temporal sequence. Two parallel negative verbal sentences are joined by wa: la yamutu fiiha + wa la yahya. Both verbs are in the present tense (indicative/marfu') with la as a simple negation particle (not jazm). The prepositional phrase fiiha (in it) refers to al-nar.

**Sarf (Morphology):** yamutu is Form I from the hollow root م-و-ت, with the long vowel uu appearing in the present. yahya is Form I from the doubled/defective root ح-ي-ي, with the double ya' resulting in the alif maqsura ending.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The la... wa la construction creates a merism of negation -- by denying both death and life, it describes an impossible liminal state that defies natural categories. This is one of the most psychologically devastating descriptions of punishment in the Quran: trapped between two states, experiencing the suffering of both without the resolution of either. The placement after the "greatest Fire" (verse 12) escalates the horror -- it is not just fire, but unending fire with no escape through death.

### Verse 14

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَدْ أَفْلَحَ مَن تَزَكَّىٰ"
  transliteration="qad aflaha man tazakkaa"

| 4 | تَزَكَّىٰ | tazakka | ز ك و | Verb - Form V, past tense, 3rd person, masculine, singular | Past verb in relative clause | he purified himself |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Emphatic qad and the Verb Forms of Success">
- **qad aflaha**: The particle qad with a past tense verb adds emphasis on certainty and completion -- "he has most certainly succeeded." This is a declarative statement of fact.
- **Form IV aflaha**: Achieved success/prosperity. The hamza prefix makes it causative: "he caused himself to prosper."
- **Form V tazakka**: Purified/sanctified oneself -- reflexive intensive. The ta- prefix signals the subject acts upon himself; the doubled kaf intensifies the purification.
- This verse begins a contrast: success (verses 14-15) vs. failure (verses 16-17), pivoting from the punishment theme of verses 11-13.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** qad + past tense verb creates emphatic perfective meaning. The subject of aflaha is the relative clause man tazakka, where man serves as a relative pronoun. The structure is: "Certainly has succeeded [he who purified himself]." The past tense in both verbs expresses completed, established truth.

**Sarf (Morphology):** aflaha is Form IV (af'ala) from root ف-ل-ح, with the hamza prefix marking the causative pattern. tazakka is Form V (tafa''ala) from root ز-ك-و, with the ta' prefix and doubled kaf marking reflexive-intensive meaning. The original form tazakkaya loses the final ya' in the past tense form.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The abrupt shift from describing hellfire (verses 11-13) to declaring success (verse 14) creates a dramatic rhetorical pivot. The emphatic qad signals that this is not a future possibility but an established divine truth. The choice of tazakka (self-purification) rather than an external action emphasizes that success requires active personal effort in spiritual cleansing. This echoes the surah's opening theme: sabbih (actively glorify) leads to tazakka (actively purify).

### Verse 15

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَذَكَرَ اسْمَ رَبِّهِ فَصَلَّىٰ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Echo of Verse 1: Ring Structure Within the Surah">
- **dhakara ism rabbihi**: Remembered/invoked his Lord's name -- this directly echoes verse 1's "sabbih isma rabbika" (glorify the name of your Lord), creating a thematic ring.
- **fa-salla**: Consequent action -- and (therefore) prayed. The fa links remembrance to prayer as cause to effect.
- Two components of success: purification (verse 14) + remembrance and prayer (verse 15).
- The shift from -ka (your Lord, verse 1) to -hi (his Lord, verse 15) reflects the change from direct address to third-person description of the successful person.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse continues the description of man tazakka from verse 14. The verb dhakara takes isma rabbihi as its object (idafa construction). The fa connects salla as a sequential/consequential action. The entire verse is coordinated with verse 14 by wa, adding further conditions for the one who "certainly succeeds."

**Sarf (Morphology):** dhakara is Form I from root ذ-ك-ر -- the simple form meaning "to remember/mention." This contrasts with dhakkir (Form II, verse 9: "remind others") and yadhdhakkaru (Form V, verse 10: "take heed for oneself") -- three different forms from the same root in one surah. salla is Form II from root ص-ل-و, meaning "to pray."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verbal echo of verse 1 (sabbih isma rabbika / dhakara isma rabbihi) creates an elegant ring structure: the surah opens with a command to glorify Allah's name and here describes the successful person as one who remembers Allah's name. The progression from dhikr (remembrance) to salah (prayer) through the sequential fa shows prayer as the natural outflow of remembrance -- one who truly remembers cannot help but pray.

### Verse 16

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Adversative bal and the Criticism of Worldly Preference">
- **bal**: Adversative particle -- shifts dramatically from describing the righteous (verses 14-15) to criticizing those who fail. It functions as "but rather" or "nay, instead."
- **tu'thiruna**: Form IV (af'ala) -- prefer/choose. The hamza prefix marks causative: "you cause [something] to be prioritized."
- **al-hayat al-dunya**: "The worldly/lower life" -- the adjective al-dunya is itself a superlative (fu'la pattern) from root د-ن-و meaning "nearer/lower," characterizing worldly life as both closer (temporary) and lower (inferior).
- This verse delivers the surah's central criticism: choosing the temporary over the eternal.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** bal introduces a new clause that contrasts with the preceding description of success. The verb tu'thiruuna is 2nd person masculine plural present tense (indicative/marfu'), addressing people generally. al-hayata is the direct object (mansub), with al-dunya as its adjective (na't) also in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** tu'thiruuna is Form IV (tufa''iluna) from root أ-ث-ر, meaning "to prefer/give precedence to." al-dunya follows the fu'la superlative feminine pattern from root د-ن-و, meaning "the nearer/lower" -- etymologically, the worldly life is called dunya because it is both closer in time and lower in status.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The adversative bal creates one of the most striking rhetorical turns in the surah. After painting a picture of success through purification and prayer, the surah suddenly pivots to accusation. The shift from third person (man tazakka, "he who purifies") to second person plural (tu'thiruuna, "you prefer") makes the criticism direct and personal. The very name al-dunya carries its own condemnation: to prefer the "lower" life is self-evidently misguided.

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction (circumstantial) | while |
| 2 | الْآخِرَةُ | al-aakhiratu | أ خ ر | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the Hereafter |
| 3 | خَيْرٌ | khayrun | خ ي ر | Noun - elative/comparative, indefinite | First predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | better |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Nominal Sentence with Double Predicate">
- **al-akhira**: The Hereafter/Next life -- mubtada' (subject) of a nominal sentence.
- **khayrun**: Comparative (ism al-tafdil) -- better (than worldly life). Indefinite with tanwin.
- **abqa**: Comparative -- more lasting/enduring. Also indefinite with tanwin (implied, though the alif maqsura replaces visible tanwin).
- The nominal sentence with a double predicate (khabar) makes two simultaneous claims: the Hereafter is BOTH better in quality AND more lasting in duration.
- Contrast: temporary dunya (verse 16) vs. eternal akhira (verse 17).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah): mubtada' (al-akhiratu, definite, marfu') + double khabar (khayrun and abqa, both indefinite, marfu'). The wa before al-akhiratu can be read as haliyyah (circumstantial: "while") or simple conjunction. The double predicate structure allows two attributes to be predicated simultaneously.

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-akhiratu from root أ-خ-ر follows the fa'ilah pattern (active participle feminine form) meaning "the latter/last." khayrun is the comparative form (af'al > khayr) from root خ-ي-ر. abqa follows the af'al comparative pattern from root ب-ق-ي with the defective ending.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The simplicity and directness of this verse is its rhetorical power. After the accusation of verse 16, this verse states the obvious truth with devastating clarity. The two comparatives (khayrun wa abqa) address the two possible reasons for preferring dunya: quality and duration -- and the akhira surpasses on both counts. The nominal sentence structure (no verb) expresses a timeless, unchanging reality. This verse, paired with verse 16, forms one of the Quran's most concise arguments against materialism.

### Verse 18

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ هَٰذَا لَفِي الصُّحُفِ الْأُولَىٰ"
  transliteration="inna haadha la-fi al-suhufi al-uulaa"
  translation="Indeed, this is in the former scriptures"

/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِنَّ | inna | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (harf tawkid) | indeed |
| 2 | هَٰذَا | hadha | - | Demonstrative - masculine, singular, near | Subject of inna (ism inna) - accusative (mansub) | this |
| 3 | لَ | la | - | Particle - emphasis | Emphasis particle (lam al-tawkid) | surely |
| 4 | فِي | fi | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition | in |
| 5 | الصُّحُفِ | al-suhufi | ص ح ف | Noun - feminine, plural, definite | Object of preposition - genitive (majrur) | the scriptures/scrolls |
| 6 | الْأُولَىٰ | al-uula | أ و ل | Noun - elative/superlative feminine plural, definite | Adjective (na't) - genitive (majrur) | the first/former |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double Emphasis: inna + lam al-tawkid">
- **inna + la**: Double emphasis construction -- inna begins the clause with emphasis ("indeed"), and the lam before the predicate (la-fi) reinforces it ("surely"). This is the strongest emphasis construction in Arabic grammar.
- **hadha**: Demonstrative pronoun referring to the teachings in this surah (purification, prayer, preference for Hereafter).
- **al-suhuf al-ula**: The first/former scriptures -- earlier divine revelations. al-suhuf is the plural of sahifah (page/scroll).
- This verse affirms the continuity of divine message across time -- what the Quran teaches was also taught in earlier revelations.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** inna takes hadha as its ism (subject, in the position of accusative though demonstratives are mabni). The khabar of inna is the prepositional phrase la-fi al-suhufi al-uula, with the emphatic lam (lam al-muzdalaqa) attached to the preposition. al-uula is a na't (adjective) for al-suhufi in the genitive case.

**Sarf (Morphology):** al-suhufi is the plural of sahifah on the fu'ul pattern from root ص-ح-ف. al-uula follows the fu'la superlative feminine plural pattern from root أ-و-ل, meaning "the first/earliest."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The double emphasis (inna + lam) underscores the theological significance of this claim: the Quranic message is not new but has ancient roots. By connecting these teachings to "the former scriptures," the surah asserts both the universality and the continuity of divine guidance. The demonstrative hadha ("this") pointing to the immediately preceding teachings (purification, remembrance, the superiority of the Hereafter) anchors the connection specifically.

### Verse 19

<ArabicExample
  arabic="صُحُفِ إِبْرَاهِيمَ وَمُوسَىٰ"
  transliteration="suhufi Ibraahiima wa Muusaa"
  translation="The scriptures of Abraham and Moses"
  reference="Al-A'la 87:19"
  highlight="إِبْرَاهِيمَ,مُوسَىٰ"
  words={[{ ar: "صُحُفِ", tr: "suhufi", en: "the scriptures" }, { ar: "إِبْرَاهِيمَ", tr: "Ibraahiima", en: "Abraham" }, { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "and" }, { ar: "مُوسَىٰ", tr: "Muusa", en: "Moses" }]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | صُحُفِ | suhufi | ص ح ف | Noun - feminine, plural, construct state | Badal (appositive) explaining al-suhuf al-ula - genitive (majrur) | the scriptures |
| 2 | إِبْرَاهِيمَ | Ibraahiima | - | Proper noun - prophet's name, foreign | Second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) in meaning | Abraham |
| 3 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Coordinating conjunction | and |
| 4 | مُوسَىٰ | Muusa | - | Proper noun - prophet's name, foreign | Coordinated second part of idafa - genitive (majrur) in meaning | Moses |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Badal (Appositive) and Indeclinable Foreign Nouns">
- **suhuf Ibrahim wa Musa**: Badal (appositive) explaining which specific scriptures are meant -- the scrolls/scriptures of Abraham and the Torah of Moses.
- **Ibrahim** and **Musa**: Foreign proper nouns that are indeclinable (mabni/mamnu' min al-sarf). Ibrahim takes fatha instead of kasra for genitive because it is a diptote (mamnu' min al-sarf due to being foreign and having the pattern if'iil). Musa ends in alif maqsura and is also indeclinable.
- This closing verse connects the Quranic message to the earliest prophetic tradition, emphasizing that the core teachings of Islam -- purification, prayer, and preference for the eternal -- are the universal truths of all divine revelation.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** suhuf Ibrahim wa Musa functions as a badal (substitute/appositive) for al-suhuf al-ula in verse 18, specifying which scriptures are meant. suhuf is in the genitive case (matching al-suhuf) and heads an idafa chain. Ibrahim is the mudaf ilayhi (genitive) but takes fatha instead of kasra because it is mamnu' min al-sarf (diptote). Musa is coordinated with Ibrahim through wa.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Ibrahim is a foreign (a'jami) name, non-Arabic in origin, which along with its pattern makes it a diptote -- it does not take tanwin or kasra. Musa is similarly foreign and indeclinable, with the alif maqsura ending preventing visible case marking.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The final verse serves as a powerful conclusion by naming specific prophets -- Abraham and Moses. The choice is significant: Abraham represents the most ancient monotheistic tradition, and Moses represents the Torah, the most established earlier scripture. By citing these two pillars of prophetic history, the surah places Muhammad's message in a line of continuity stretching back to the very origins of revealed religion. The surah thus ends not with the Quran's uniqueness but with its universality -- a rhetorically powerful closing that transforms what might seem like a localized message into an eternal truth.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify all Form II (fa''ala) verbs in this surah and explain how the doubling of the middle radical (tashdid) changes the meaning from the base Form I. What pattern do you notice about when the Quran uses Form II in this surah?">

**Form II verbs in Al-A'la:**

1. **سَبِّحِ (sabbih)** - v.1 - Root: س-ب-ح - Form I sabaha = to swim/float; Form II sabbaha = to glorify/declare glory (intensive: repeated declaration of glory)
2. **سَوَّىٰ (sawwa)** - v.2 - Root: س-و-ي - Form I sawiya = to be equal/level; Form II sawwa = to make proportioned/balanced (causative: caused something to be proportioned)
3. **قَدَّرَ (qaddara)** - v.3 - Root: ق-د-ر - Form I qadara = to be able/have power; Form II qaddara = to measure precisely/decree (intensive: thorough measurement and determination)
4. **ذَكِّرْ (dhakkir)** - v.9 - Root: ذ-ك-ر - Form I dhakara = to remember; Form II dhakkara = to remind (causative: cause someone else to remember)
5. **صَلَّىٰ (salla)** - v.15 - Root: ص-ل-و - Form I sala = to roast/burn; Form II salla = to pray (specialized intensive meaning)
6. **نُيَسِّرُكَ (nuyassiru)** - v.8 - Root: ي-س-ر - Form I yasura = to be easy; Form II yassara = to make easy/facilitate (causative: cause something to become easy)

**Pattern:** Form II in this surah consistently appears for actions involving transformation or making something happen -- glorifying (making glory manifest), proportioning (making things balanced), decreeing (making destiny), reminding (making someone remember), praying (making connection), facilitating (making easy). The surah uses Form II for divine creative actions and for the human religious duties that respond to them.

<ExerciseBox question="Trace the use of the root ذ-ك-ر across verses 9, 10, and 15. Identify the verb form used in each case and explain how the different forms create a chain of meaning about remembrance.">

**Root ذ-ك-ر in three verses:**

1. **Verse 9: ذَكِّرْ (dhakkir)** - Form II imperative
   - Meaning: "Remind [others]"
   - The doubled kaf makes it causative: cause someone else to remember
   - Direction: outward (Prophet to people)

2. **Verse 9: الذِّكْرَىٰ (al-dhikra)** - Masdar/verbal noun (fi'la pattern)
   - Meaning: "the reminder/remembrance"
   - Functions as the subject of nafa'at (if the reminder benefits)
   - The concept itself, abstracted from any agent

3. **Verse 10: يَذَّكَّرُ (yadhdhakkaru)** - Form V present (originally yatadhakkaru)
   - Meaning: "will take heed/remember for himself"
   - The ta- prefix makes it reflexive: the remembrance benefits the one doing it
   - Direction: inward (the listener to himself)

4. **Verse 15: ذَكَرَ (dhakara)** - Form I past
   - Meaning: "he remembered/mentioned"
   - The simple, basic act of remembering
   - Direction: upward (the successful person to his Lord)

**Chain of meaning:** The progression moves from external command (Form II: remind others) to internalized response (Form V: take heed within oneself) to active worship (Form I: remember one's Lord). This traces the journey of guidance: a message is delivered -> it is internalized -> it transforms into action. The root ذ-ك-ر thus carries the entire arc of spiritual transformation in three verb forms.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the two merisms (opposite pairs) in this surah: الْجَهْرَ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ (verse 7) and لَا يَمُوتُ... وَلَا يَحْيَىٰ (verse 13). How do they differ in structure and rhetorical effect?">

**Merism 1 (verse 7): الْجَهْرَ وَمَا يَخْفَىٰ - "the open and what is hidden"**
- **Structure:** Positive assertion -- Allah KNOWS both extremes
- **Grammar:** Definite noun (al-jahra) + relative clause (ma yakhfa) joined by wa
- **Asymmetry:** The open is a simple noun; the hidden is expressed as a relative clause (more elaborate, reflecting its greater mystery)
- **Effect:** Affirms totality of divine knowledge by naming both extremes and implying everything between
- **Rhetorical purpose:** Reassurance and awe -- nothing escapes Allah's knowledge

**Merism 2 (verse 13): لَا يَمُوتُ فِيهَا وَلَا يَحْيَىٰ - "neither dies nor lives"**
- **Structure:** Negative denial -- the wretched one experiences NEITHER extreme
- **Grammar:** Two parallel negative clauses (la + present verb) joined by wa la
- **Symmetry:** Both sides are structurally parallel (la + verb), reflecting the balanced horror
- **Effect:** Describes an impossible, agonizing state by denying both natural outcomes
- **Rhetorical purpose:** Terror and warning -- trapped in a state that defies natural categories

**Key difference:** Verse 7's merism is additive (both extremes affirmed = totality), while verse 13's merism is subtractive (both extremes denied = impossible liminal state). One inspires awe at divine completeness; the other inspires dread at unending torment.
