</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="A Grammar Lesson in Gratitude">
Surah Quraysh is unique for its grammatical complexity packed into simple content. It features a masdar (verbal noun) that governs its own accusative object, a third-person imperative (rare in everyday Arabic), a three-level iḍāfah chain (رَبَّ هَـٰذَا الْبَيْتِ), and perfect parallelism in its Form IV verbs. The surah's logic flows through grammar: "Because of X (causation) → therefore Y (consequence)."

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="لِ Expressing Causation Across Surahs">
لِ here expresses causation or purpose, and some scholars connect it to the final verb of Surah Al-Fil (فَجَعَلَهُمْ), making these two surahs grammatically linked. إِيلَافِ is a masdar (verbal noun) from Form IV verb آلَفَ (to make familiar/accustomed). إِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ forms an iḍāfah: "the accustoming of Quraysh."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The لِ preposition governs إِيلَافِ in the genitive. إِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ is an iḍāfah construction where the masdar (verbal noun) is the muḍāf and the proper noun قُرَيْشٍ is the muḍāf ilayhi (genitive). This verse is grammatically incomplete — it states the cause but the consequence (worship) comes in verse 3.

**Sarf (Morphology):** إِيلَافِ is the masdar of Form IV آلَفَ, following the إِفْعَال pattern. Form IV adds a causative meaning: while أَلِفَ (Form I) means "to be familiar with," آلَفَ (Form IV) means "to make familiar/accustomed." قُرَيْشٍ is a diminutive form (تَصْغِير), possibly from قِرْش (shark) — a tribal name.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with لِ (because of) immediately establishes a logical argument: a reason is being presented before its consequence. The audience must listen to discover what the cause leads to. This rhetorical delay builds anticipation across two verses before the command arrives in verse 3.

### Verse 2

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِيلَافِهِمْ | ʾīlāfihim | ا ل ف | Noun - verbal noun (masdar), masculine, singular, definite + attached pronoun | Apposition/clarification of previous إِيلَافِ - genitive (majrur), + possessive pronoun genitive | their accustoming |
| 2 | رِحْلَةَ | riḥlata | ر ح ل | Noun - feminine, singular, definite (by idafa) | Object of the verbal noun - accusative (mansub) with fatha | journey, caravan |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Masdar Governing an Accusative Object">
إِيلَافِهِمْ is a verbal noun (masdar) that governs رِحْلَةَ in the accusative — just as the verb آلَفَ would take a direct object. This is a key Arabic grammar principle: masdars retain the verb's ability to govern objects. The masdar "their accustoming" takes "the journey" as its object, just as "they accustomed themselves to the journey" would in verbal form.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِيلَافِهِمْ is an apposition (badal) or clarification of the إِيلَافِ in verse 1, adding the pronoun هِمْ (their). The masdar governs رِحْلَةَ as its maf'ūl bihi (direct object) in the accusative. رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَاءِ وَالصَّيْفِ is a nested iḍāfah: "the journey of winter and summer." الشِّتَاءِ and الصَّيْفِ are coordinated by وَ, both in the genitive as muḍāf ilayhi.

**Sarf (Morphology):** رِحْلَةَ from root ر-ح-ل on the فِعْلَة pattern denotes a single instance of traveling (a single journey/caravan). الشِّتَاءِ from root ش-ت-و on the فِعْلَاء pattern, and الصَّيْفِ from root ص-ي-ف on the فَعْل pattern — contrasting seasons named by different morphological patterns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition of إِيلَاف (from verse 1 to verse 2) with the added pronoun هِمْ (their) creates emphasis through elaboration. Historical context enriches the grammar: Quraysh had two annual trade caravans — winter to Yemen, summer to Syria — which were their economic lifeline. The pairing of الشِّتَاءِ وَالصَّيْفِ (winter and summer) represents the totality of the year, implying constant divine provision.

### Verse 3

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Consequential conjunction - not declinable | so, then |
| 2 | لْ | li | - | Particle - command | Imperative particle (lam al-amr) - not declinable | let (command) |
| 3 | يَعْبُدُوا | yaʿbudū | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, present tense (jussive), 3rd person, masculine, plural | Jussive verb (fi'l mudari' majzum) after lam al-amr - jussive with dropped nun | they worship |
| 4 | رَبَّ | rabba | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine, singular, definite (by idafa) | Direct object (maf'ul bihi) - accusative (mansub) with fatha | Lord |
| 5 | هَـٰذَا | hādhā | - | Demonstrative pronoun - near, masculine singular | First part of idafa (mudaf ilayh) - genitive position | this |
| 6 | الْبَيْتِ | al-bayti | ب ي ت | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Second part of idafa (mudaf ilayh) - genitive with kasra | the House |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Third-Person Imperative with لَمْ al-Amr">
فَلْيَعْبُدُوا uses لْ (lam al-amr) to create a third-person command. Arabic has no direct imperative for third person — you can't say "let them" with a simple verb form. Instead, لْ + present tense verb in jussive mood achieves this. The original يَعْبُدُونَ (indicative) becomes يَعْبُدُوا (jussive) — the نْ drops as the jussive marker for verbs ending in واو الجماعة.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ connects the command as the logical consequence of verses 1-2 (consequential فَ). لْ (lam al-amr) places يَعْبُدُوا in the jussive mood. رَبَّ هَـٰذَا الْبَيْتِ forms a three-level iḍāfah chain: رَبَّ is muḍāf (accusative as maf'ūl bihi), هَـٰذَا is a demonstrative in genitive position, and الْبَيْتِ is in the genitive with kasra. "The Lord of this House" = the Lord of the Ka'bah.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَعْبُدُوا from root ع-ب-د on the Form I pattern يَفْعُل. The jussive is marked by dropping the نْ from يَعْبُدُونَ → يَعْبُدُوا. رَبَّ from root ر-ب-ب with doubled final radical on the فَعْل pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The entire surah's grammatical structure resolves here: لِ (because of, verse 1) → فَ (therefore, verse 3). Two verses of cause lead to one verse of consequence. The specification "this House" (هَـٰذَا الْبَيْتِ) rather than just "Allah" grounds the command in their lived reality — the Ka'bah they know, the trade they depend on, the security they enjoy.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form IV Causative: Making Things Happen">
Both verbs in this verse are Form IV (أَفْعَلَ), which adds a causative meaning:
- طَعِمَ (Form I) = "to eat/taste" → أَطْعَمَ (Form IV) = "to CAUSE to eat" = "to feed"
- أَمِنَ (Form I) = "to be safe" → آمَنَ (Form IV) = "to CAUSE to be safe" = "to secure"

Form IV transforms intransitive actions into transitive ones — Allah doesn't just provide food; He causes them to be fed. He doesn't just create safety; He causes them to be secured.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّذِي is a relative pronoun (ism mawṣūl) describing رَبَّ from verse 3, maintaining the accusative position. It introduces a relative clause (ṣilat al-mawṣūl). Both أَطْعَمَهُم and آمَنَهُم carry attached object pronouns هُم (them). مِّن in both instances means "from/against" — protection from a negative state.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَطْعَمَ from root ط-ع-م and آمَنَ from root ا-م-ن — both on the Form IV أَفْعَلَ pattern. This pattern is the most common way to create causative verbs in Arabic. The attached pronoun هُم (them) serves as the maf'ūl bihi (direct object). Both جُوعٍ and خَوْفٍ are indefinite masdars on the فُعْل and فَعْل patterns respectively.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The perfect parallelism is striking: أَطْعَمَهُم مِّن جُوعٍ / آمَنَهُم مِّنْ خَوْفٍ — same verb form, same pronoun, same preposition, balanced nouns. This creates rhythmic symmetry that emphasizes the two fundamental human needs: sustenance (food against hunger) and security (safety against fear). The indefiniteness of جُوعٍ and خَوْفٍ (no الـ) makes them general — not just specific hunger but ALL hunger, not just specific fear but ALL fear.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify all iḍāfah constructions in this surah. For each, state the muḍāf and muḍāf ilayhi, and explain whether the iḍāfah is possessive, descriptive, or another type.">

**1. إِيلَافِ قُرَيْشٍ (Verse 1)**
- Muḍāf: إِيلَافِ (genitive, governed by لِ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: قُرَيْشٍ (genitive)
- Type: Subjective iḍāfah — Quraysh is the one doing the "accustoming" (the subject of the verbal noun)

**2. رِحْلَةَ الشِّتَاءِ (Verse 2)**
- Muḍāf: رِحْلَةَ (accusative, as object of masdar)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: الشِّتَاءِ (genitive)
- Type: Temporal iḍāfah — "the journey OF winter" specifies when the journey happens

**3. رَبَّ هَـٰذَا الْبَيْتِ (Verse 3)**
- Muḍāf: رَبَّ (accusative, as maf'ūl bihi)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: هَـٰذَا الْبَيْتِ (genitive)
- Type: Possessive iḍāfah — "the Lord OF this House" shows ownership/lordship

**Key insight:** The same grammatical structure (iḍāfah) serves different semantic relationships: subjective (who does the action), temporal (when it happens), and possessive (who owns what). Context determines the meaning, not the grammar alone.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Explain why يَعْبُدُوا in verse 3 is in the jussive mood. What is the jussive marker? What would the verb look like in indicative mood?">

**Why jussive:** يَعْبُدُوا is in the jussive mood (majzūm) because it follows لْ (lam al-amr), the imperative particle for third-person commands. Lam al-amr is one of the jawāzim (particles that cause the jussive mood).

**Jussive marker:** For verbs conjugated with واو الجماعة (masculine plural suffix), the jussive is marked by **dropping the نْ** from the end:
- Indicative: يَعْبُدُونَ (with نَ at the end — the نْ is the marker of the indicative for this conjugation pattern)
- Jussive: يَعْبُدُوا (نَ dropped — this is the jussive marker)

**In indicative mood:** يَعْبُدُونَ (ya'budūna) — "they worship" (a statement of fact)

**Comparison:**
- **يَعْبُدُونَ** (indicative) = "they worship" — describing what happens
- **يَعْبُدُوا** (jussive after لْ) = "let them worship" — commanding what should happen
- The فَ before لْ adds "therefore" — "therefore, let them worship"

This is one of the five signs of i'rāb for the present tense verb: the five conjugations that end in نْ (ينَ, انِ, ونَ, etc.) drop their نْ in the jussive.
