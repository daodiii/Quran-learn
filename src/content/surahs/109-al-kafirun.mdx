# Al-Kafirun (The Disbelievers)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 6
- **Theme:** A clear declaration of the distinction between the faith of believers and disbelievers, emphasizing religious tolerance and separation of practices.
- **Grammar Focus:** Negation with لَا (la), verb vs. active participle contrast, present vs. past tense, vocative construction, nominal sentences, inverted word order, repetition (takrar)

### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ | Imperative + vocative | Imperative قُلْ + يَا أَيُّهَا address | Command to declare separation |
| 2 | لَا أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ | Verbal (negated) | لَا + present tense verb | I don't worship what you worship |
| 3 | وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ | Nominal (negated) | لَا + active participle | You are not worshippers of what I worship |
| 4 | وَلَا أَنَا عَابِدٌ مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ | Nominal (negated) | لَا + active participle + past tense | I am not a worshipper of what you worshipped |
| 5 | وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ | Nominal (negated) | Exact repetition of v3 | Emphatic restatement |
| 6 | لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِيَ دِينِ | Nominal (inverted) | Predicate-subject order | To you your religion, to me mine |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Surah Matters for Grammar">
Al-Kafirun is built entirely on the contrast between verbal sentences (v2) and nominal sentences (v3-5). The shift from present tense verbs to active participles, and the insertion of a past tense verb in v4, reveals how Arabic uses different grammatical structures to express different aspects of the same concept. The surah is a masterclass in negation, parallelism, and the verb-participle distinction.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ"
  transliteration="qul yā ayyuhā l-kāfirūna"
  translation="Say: O disbelievers"

  highlight="يَا أَيُّهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ | qul | ق و ل | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person masculine singular | Command verb (fi'l amr) - mabni | Say |
| 2 | يَا | yā | - | Particle - vocative | Vocative particle (harf nida') - mabni | O |
| 3 | أَيُّهَا | ayyuhā | - | Demonstrative - vocative attention word | Called upon (munada) - mabni | [vocative attention particle] |
| 4 | الْكَافِرُونَ | al-kafiruna | ك ف ر | Noun - masculine plural, definite, active participle | Vocative apposition (badal) - nominative (marfu') | The disbelievers |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Vocative with يَا أَيُّهَا for Definite Nouns">
Arabic has two vocative patterns: (1) **يَا + indefinite noun** (يَا رَجُلُ = "O man") where the noun is mabni on damma, and (2) **يَا أَيُّهَا + definite noun** (يَا أَيُّهَا الْكَافِرُونَ = "O disbelievers") where أَيُّهَا acts as a bridge because vocatives normally cannot take the definite article. الْكَافِرُونَ follows as badal (apposition) in the nominative case.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** قُلْ is an imperative (fi'l amr) with the implied subject أَنتَ (you, the Prophet). يَا is the vocative particle, أَيُّهَا is the munada (called upon), and الْكَافِرُونَ is badal (apposition) following it in the nominative. The entire vocative phrase is the maqul al-qawl (reported speech) of قُلْ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْكَافِرُونَ is the sound masculine plural of كَافِر, an active participle (ism al-fa'il) from root ك-ف-ر on pattern فَاعِل. The active participle denotes an ongoing state — not "those who disbelieved once" but "those who are in a state of disbelief."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with قُلْ makes this a commanded declaration, not a private thought. The Prophet is ordered to make this statement publicly. Addressing them directly as الْكَافِرُونَ — their defining characteristic — establishes the entire surah's theme of identity and separation.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَا أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ"
  transliteration="lā a'budu mā ta'budūna"
  translation="I do not worship what you worship"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:2"
  highlight="لَا,أَعْبُدُ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | لَا | la | - | Particle - negation | Negative particle (harf nafy) - mabni | Not |
| 2 | أَعْبُدُ | a'budu | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, present tense, 1st person singular | Present tense verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') | I worship |
| 3 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (mawsul) - mabni | What, that which |
| 4 | تَعْبُدُونَ | ta'buduna | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, present tense, 2nd person masculine plural | Present tense verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') | You (plural) worship |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="لَا for Present/Future Negation">
لَا before a present tense verb (fi'l mudari') negates both the present and the future: "I do not worship and will not worship." This is categorical negation — not a one-time refusal, but a permanent stance. Compare with لَمْ (which negates the past) and لَنْ (emphatic future negation).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a verbal sentence (jumlah fi'liyyah): لَا negates the verb أَعْبُدُ. The relative pronoun مَا serves as the maf'ul bihi (direct object) of أَعْبُدُ, and its relative clause is تَعْبُدُونَ ("what you worship"). The hidden return pronoun (عائد) in the relative clause is implied: "what you worship [it]."

**Sarf (Morphology):** Both أَعْبُدُ and تَعْبُدُونَ are from root ع-ب-د, Form I. The shift in person (1st to 2nd) with the same root creates a mirror effect: "I worship" vs. "you worship" — same action, different doers, different objects.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Using مَا ("what") rather than مَنْ ("who") is significant. مَا refers to non-rational beings, subtly characterizing the disbelievers' objects of worship as inanimate things, not worthy of the title "deity."

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ"
  transliteration="wa-lā antum 'ābidūna mā a'budu"
  translation="Nor are you worshippers of what I worship"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:3"
  highlight="أَنتُمْ,عَابِدُونَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَلَا | wa-la | - | Particle - conjunction + negation | Coordinating conjunction + negative particle - mabni | And not / nor |
| 2 | أَنتُمْ | antum | - | Pronoun - detached, 2nd person masculine plural | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | You (plural) |
| 3 | عَابِدُونَ | 'abiduna | ع ب د | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite, active participle | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | Worshippers |
| 4 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun - mabni | What |
| 5 | أَعْبُدُ | a'budu | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, present tense, 1st person singular | Present tense verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') | I worship |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Verbal Sentence (v2) vs. Nominal Sentence (v3)">
Verse 2 uses a **verbal sentence**: لَا أَعْبُدُ (negated verb). Verse 3 shifts to a **nominal sentence**: أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ (pronoun + active participle). The verbal sentence describes an *action* (I don't perform worship). The nominal sentence describes a *state* (you are not worshippers). This grammatical shift deepens the negation — it's not just that they don't worship Allah, they fundamentally lack the quality of being His worshippers.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah): أَنتُمْ is the mubtada' (subject) and عَابِدُونَ is the khabar (predicate). The negation particle لَا here negates the entire nominal sentence. مَا أَعْبُدُ is a relative clause functioning as the maf'ul bihi of عَابِدُونَ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** عَابِدُونَ is the sound masculine plural of عَابِد (active participle, pattern فَاعِل, root ع-ب-د). As an active participle, it denotes a settled attribute or ongoing characteristic, not a momentary action. The plural ending ـُونَ marks it as nominative.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The reversal — "I don't worship yours" (v2) then "you don't worship mine" (v3) — creates a chiastic balance. The shift from verb to participle intensifies: the disbelievers' rejection is not merely behavioral but essential — they lack the very nature of being worshippers of Allah.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَا أَنَا عَابِدٌ مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ"
  transliteration="wa-lā anā 'ābidun mā 'abadtum"
  translation="And I am not a worshipper of what you have worshipped"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:4"
  highlight="عَابِدٌ,عَبَدتُّمْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَلَا | wa-la | - | Particle - conjunction + negation | Coordinating conjunction + negative particle - mabni | And not / nor |
| 2 | أَنَا | ana | - | Pronoun - detached, 1st person singular | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | I |
| 3 | عَابِدٌ | 'abidun | ع ب د | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, active participle | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | A worshipper |
| 4 | مَّا | ma | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun - mabni | What |
| 5 | عَبَدتُّمْ | 'abadtum | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, past tense, 2nd person masculine plural | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni | You (plural) worshipped |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Past Tense Shift: عَبَدتُّمْ">
Verses 2-3 use present tense verbs (تَعْبُدُونَ, أَعْبُدُ), but verse 4 shifts to the **past tense** عَبَدتُّمْ ("what you have worshipped"). This broadens the negation temporally: "I am not a worshipper of what you worshipped in the past." The present tense covers current and future worship; the past tense covers historical worship. Together, they create a total negation across all time.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Parallel to verse 3 but with 1st person: أَنَا (mubtada') + عَابِدٌ (khabar). The singular عَابِدٌ contrasts with the plural عَابِدُونَ in verse 3, matching the singular subject أَنَا. The relative clause مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ uses past tense, governing the relative pronoun مَا.

**Sarf (Morphology):** عَبَدتُّمْ is Form I past tense with the 2nd person masculine plural suffix ـتُّمْ. The doubled تّ results from the assimilation of the root's final consonant with the pronoun suffix (عَبَدْ + تُمْ → عَبَدتُّمْ). Note the shift from active participle (عَابِدٌ, describing state) to past tense verb (عَبَدتُّمْ, describing completed action).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The singular عَابِدٌ (vs. plural عَابِدُونَ in v3) subtly shifts the perspective: the Prophet stands alone as one individual rejecting idolatry. The indefiniteness of عَابِدٌ (with tanwin) adds emphasis — "I am in no way a worshipper." The temporal shift to past tense seals the argument: not even what they historically worshipped can claim his devotion.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ"
  transliteration="wa-lā antum 'ābidūna mā a'budu"
  translation="Nor are you worshippers of what I worship"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:5"
  highlight="وَلَا"
/>

| 2 | أَنتُمْ | antum | - | Pronoun - detached, 2nd person masculine plural | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | You (plural) |
| 3 | عَابِدُونَ | 'abiduna | ع ب د | Noun - masculine plural, indefinite, active participle | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | Worshippers |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why the Repetition of Verse 3?">
Verse 5 is word-for-word identical to verse 3. Arabic rhetoric (balagha) distinguishes between meaningless repetition (which is a defect) and **emphatic repetition** (takrar li-l-ta'kid), which serves a purpose. Here the repetition seals the argument after the temporal expansion in v4: having negated present, future, AND past worship, the surah restates the final conclusion — this separation is permanent and absolute.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Identical to verse 3 — nominal sentence with أَنتُمْ as mubtada' and عَابِدُونَ as khabar, negated by لَا.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Same forms as verse 3. The identical morphology reinforces the message: nothing has changed, nothing will change.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Scholars note the carefully designed alternating pattern: v2 (I→you), v3 (you→me), v4 (I→you, past), v5 (you→me, repeated). This creates an ABAB structure where each pair covers both directions of the separation. The repetition of v3 as v5 creates an envelope that frames verse 4's temporal expansion, ensuring the final word is about their permanent exclusion from true worship.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِيَ دِينِ"
  transliteration="lakum dīnukum wa-liya dīni"
  translation="To you is your religion, and to me is my religion"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:6"
  highlight="لَكُمْ,وَلِيَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | لَكُمْ | lakum | - | Particle - preposition + attached pronoun 2nd person plural | Preposition + pronoun acting as predicate (khabar muqaddam) - mabni | To you / for you |
| 2 | دِينُكُمْ | dinukum | د ي ن | Noun - masculine singular + attached pronoun 2nd person plural | Subject (mubtada' mu'akhkhar) - nominative (marfu') | Your religion |
| 3 | وَلِيَ | wa-liya | - | Conjunction + preposition + attached pronoun 1st person singular | Coordinating conjunction + preposition + pronoun acting as predicate (khabar muqaddam) - mabni | And to me / for me |
| 4 | دِينِ | dini | د ي ن | Noun - masculine singular + implied attached pronoun 1st person singular | Subject (mubtada' mu'akhkhar) - nominative (marfu') | My religion |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Inverted Word Order (Taqdim al-Khabar)">
Normal Arabic word order is: subject (mubtada') then predicate (khabar). Here both sentences invert this: **لَكُمْ** (predicate) **دِينُكُمْ** (subject), and **لِيَ** (predicate) **دِينِ** (subject). Fronting the predicate (taqdim al-khabar) creates emphasis and restriction (hasr): "To YOU belongs your religion" (and to no one else), "To ME belongs mine" (and to no one else). The inversion transforms a simple statement into a declaration of exclusive possession.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Two parallel nominal sentences with inverted order. In each: the prepositional phrase (لَكُمْ / لِيَ) is the khabar muqaddam (fronted predicate) and the noun (دِينُكُمْ / دِينِ) is the mubtada' mu'akhkhar (delayed subject). Note that دِينِ appears with kasra — this is the form of the first person possessive suffix ـِي with the ya dropped (a common Quranic stylistic choice for pause at verse endings).

**Sarf (Morphology):** دِين from root د-ي-ن on pattern فِعْل means religion, way of life, or recompense. The same root gives يَوْمَ الدِّينِ (Day of Judgment). The attached pronouns ـكُمْ (your) and ـِي (my) mark the final separation.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After five verses of detailed negation, verse 6 delivers the conclusion in stunning brevity. The balanced structure — لَكُمْ...وَلِيَ — creates a perfect mirror, visually and sonically representing the complete separation. This is not compromise but clarity: each party has been assigned their way with finality. The rhetorical device is called muqabalah (antithetical parallelism).

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Verses 2-5 all negate worship, but use different grammatical structures. Identify the sentence type (verbal or nominal) and the tense of each verse, then explain why the surah varies its grammar rather than simply repeating the same structure.">

| Verse | Structure | Tense | Analysis |
|-------|-----------|-------|----------|
| v2 | **Verbal** (لَا + أَعْبُدُ) | Present | Negates the *action* of worship — "I do not do this" |
| v3 | **Nominal** (أَنتُمْ + عَابِدُونَ) | Present (via participle) | Negates the *state/identity* — "You are not worshippers" |
| v4 | **Nominal** (أَنَا + عَابِدٌ) | Past (عَبَدتُّمْ) | Negates identity regarding *historical* worship |
| v5 | **Nominal** (= verse 3) | Present (via participle) | Emphatic restatement sealing the argument |

The variation serves three purposes:
1. **Deepening negation**: From action (v2) to identity (v3-5) — not just "I don't do it" but "I am not that kind of person"
2. **Temporal completeness**: Present (v2-3), past (v4), then repeated present (v5) covers all time
3. **Avoiding meaningless repetition**: Arabic rhetoric considers mere repetition a defect; varying the structure while conveying the same message is considered eloquence (balagha)
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="In verse 6, identify the mubtada' and khabar in each of the two sentences. Why is the word order inverted, and what rhetorical effect does this inversion (taqdim) create?">

**First sentence: لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ**
- **Khabar muqaddam** (fronted predicate): لَكُمْ (the prepositional phrase "to you")
- **Mubtada' mu'akhkhar** (delayed subject): دِينُكُمْ ("your religion")

**Second sentence: وَلِيَ دِينِ**
- **Khabar muqaddam**: لِيَ (the prepositional phrase "to me")
- **Mubtada' mu'akhkhar**: دِينِ ("my religion")

**Why inverted?** Normal order would be: دِينُكُمْ لَكُمْ ("your religion is for you"). Fronting the prepositional phrase creates **hasr** (restriction/exclusivity): "To YOU — and only you — belongs your religion." The emphasis falls on the *separation of ownership*, not on the religion itself.

**Rhetorical effect:** The parallel inversions create a visual and sonic mirror — لَكُمْ...وَلِيَ — representing the complete, balanced separation between the two ways of life. This is muqabalah (antithetical parallelism), one of the most powerful devices in Arabic rhetoric.

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Vocative يَا أَيُّهَا**: Required for calling definite nouns — أَيُّهَا bridges the vocative particle to the definite noun
- **Negation with لَا**: Used for present/future negation of verbs and nominal sentences
- **Verbal vs. nominal negation**: v2 negates an action (verb), v3-5 negate a state (active participle)
- **Active participles as predicates**: عَابِد / عَابِدُون describe an ongoing characteristic, not a one-time action
- **Present vs. past tense contrast**: تَعْبُدُونَ (present) vs. عَبَدتُّمْ (past) creates total temporal negation
- **Inverted word order (taqdim)**: لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ fronts the predicate for emphasis and restriction
- **Repetition (takrar)**: Verses 3 and 5 are identical — emphatic repetition affirming permanent separation
- **Parallel structure (muqabalah)**: Each verse mirrors the others, creating antithetical balance
- **Attached pronouns**: ـكُمْ (your), ـِي (my) on nouns and prepositions showing possession
