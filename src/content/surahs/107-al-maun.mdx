# Al-Ma'un (Small Kindnesses)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 7
- **Theme:** Condemns religious hypocrisy — those who deny the Day of Judgment, mistreat orphans, neglect the poor, and perform prayers ostentatiously while refusing the smallest acts of kindness.
- **Grammar Focus:** Rhetorical interrogative أَرَأَيْتَ, relative clauses with الَّذِي/الَّذِينَ, exclamatory وَيْلٌ construction, active participles (الْمُصَلِّينَ, سَاهُونَ), Form III يُرَاءُونَ, present tense for habitual action

### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | أَرَأَيْتَ الَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِالدِّينِ | Interrogative + Relative | أَ + رَأَيْتَ + relative clause | Have you seen the one who denies judgment? |
| 2 | فَذَٰلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ | Nominal (demonstrative) | فَ consequential + ذَٰلِكَ + relative | That is the one who repels the orphan |
| 3 | وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ | Verbal (negative) | لَا + present tense + idafah | And does not encourage feeding the poor |
| 4 | فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ | Nominal (exclamatory) | وَيْلٌ + لِ + active participle | So woe to those who pray |
| 5 | الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ | Nominal (relative clause) | هُمْ + active participle khabar | Who are heedless of their prayer |
| 6 | الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ | Nominal (relative clause) | Form III verb = showing off | Those who make show of deeds |
| 7 | وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ | Verbal | Present tense + direct object | And withhold simple assistance |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="A Surah of Two Halves">
Al-Ma'un divides into two sections that mirror each other: verses 1-3 describe the denier by his ACTIONS (repelling orphans, ignoring the poor), while verses 4-7 describe the hypocrite by his WORSHIP (praying for show, refusing kindness). The grammar reinforces this structure: the first half uses 3rd person singular (he does, he doesn't), while the second half shifts to 3rd person plural (they are heedless, they show off) — moving from a single archetype to a condemned group.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="أَرَأَيْتَ: The Rhetorical 'Have You Seen?'">
أَرَأَيْتَ is a Quranic formula combining the interrogative أَ with the verb رَأَيْتَ. It does not literally ask about physical sight — it means "Have you considered? Do you know?" The question expects no answer; instead it draws the listener's attention to something remarkable or condemnable. The verb رَأَى here takes a direct object (الَّذِي) in the sense of "to consider, to know about."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The interrogative أَ precedes the verb رَأَيْتَ forming a rhetorical question. الَّذِي is the مَفْعُول بِهِ (direct object) of رَأَيْتَ, in the accusative position (في مَحَلّ نَصْب). The verb يُكَذِّبُ within the relative clause is the صِلَة الموصول — it has no independent i'rab position. بِالدِّينِ is a prepositional phrase: بِ governs الدِّينِ in the genitive.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُكَذِّبُ is a Form II verb (فَعَّلَ → يُفَعِّلُ) from root ك-ذ-ب. Form II adds intensity and declarative meaning to the base root: while كَذَبَ (Form I) means "he lied," كَذَّبَ (Form II) means "he called someone a liar" or "he denied/rejected." The doubled middle radical ذّ is the morphological marker of Form II. The بِ preposition with يُكَذِّبُ indicates what is being denied.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah opens with a question rather than a statement, immediately engaging the listener. The use of الَّذِي (singular masculine) creates a specific archetype — not "those who deny" but "THE one who denies," making the portrait sharp and personal. الدِّينِ with the definite article refers to THE Recompense (the Day of Judgment), not religion in general. The opening verse poses a challenge: can you identify this person? The following verses reveal him not through theology but through behavior.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَذَٰلِكَ الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ"
  transliteration="fa-dhalika lladhi yadu''u l-yatim"
  translation="For that is the one who repels the orphan"
  reference="Al-Ma'un 107:2"
  highlight="فَذَٰلِكَ,يَدُعُّ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | فَ | fa | - | Particle - conjunction | Consequential/explanatory conjunction - mabni | so, for, then |
| 2 | ذَٰلِكَ | dhalika | - | Demonstrative pronoun - far, masculine singular | Mubtada' (subject) - nominative position (mahall raf') | that, that one |
| 3 | الَّذِي | alladhi | - | Pronoun - relative, masculine singular | Khabar (predicate) - nominative position (mahall raf') | the one who |
| 4 | يَدُعُّ | yadu''u | د ع ع | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Fi'l mudari' - indicative (marfu') with damma | pushes away, repels |
| 5 | الْيَتِيمَ | al-yatima | ي ت م | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Maf'ul bihi (direct object) - accusative (mansub) with fatha | the orphan |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The فَ of Consequence: Linking Belief to Action">
The فَ here is فَاء السَّبَبِيَّة (consequential fa), meaning "so, as a result." It creates a cause-and-effect link: BECAUSE he denies the Judgment (v1), THEREFORE he repels the orphan (v2). The grammar itself argues that denial of accountability leads directly to cruelty. This is not just descriptive — it's a logical argument encoded in a single particle.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is فَاء الفَصِيحَة or فَاء السَّبَبِيَّة, connecting the consequence to its cause. ذَٰلِكَ is the mubtada' (subject) and الَّذِي يَدُعُّ الْيَتِيمَ is the khabar (predicate). The nominal sentence structure ذَٰلِكَ الَّذِي creates an equation: "that one = the one who repels." يَدُعُّ takes الْيَتِيمَ as its direct object (maf'ul bihi, accusative with fatha).

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَدُعُّ is from root د-ع-ع (a doubled/geminate root) on the Form I pattern يَفْعُلُ. The doubled final radical عّ creates the emphatic pronunciation. This verb means "to push violently, to shove away" — stronger than mere neglect. الْيَتِيم from root ي-ت-م on the فَعِيل pattern denotes the child who has lost his father — a person of utmost vulnerability in Arabian society.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** ذَٰلِكَ (far demonstrative: "THAT one") creates contemptuous distance — the speaker points to this person as someone to be observed and condemned from afar. The present tense يَدُعُّ indicates habitual action — this is not a one-time event but his character. The choice of يَدُعُّ (to shove, to push violently) over a milder verb like يَتْرُكُ (to leave alone) paints a picture of active cruelty, not passive neglect. The orphan is already the most vulnerable member of society; to violently repel him reveals the depths of the denier's moral corruption.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَا يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ"
  transliteration="wa-la yahuddu 'ala ta'ami l-miskin"
  translation="And does not encourage the feeding of the poor"
  reference="Al-Ma'un 107:3"
  highlight="لَا,يَحُضُّ"

| 5 | طَعَامِ | ta'ami | ط ع م | Noun - masculine, singular, construct state (mudaf) | Majrur by 'ala - genitive with kasra | food, feeding of |
| 6 | الْمِسْكِينِ | al-miskini | س ك ن | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Mudaf ilayhi - genitive with kasra | the poor person |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Not Feeding, But Not Even Encouraging">
Notice the precision: the verse does NOT say "he does not FEED the poor" — it says he does not even ENCOURAGE feeding the poor. يَحُضُّ عَلَىٰ means "to urge/encourage others to do something." This person is condemned for a double failure: he neither acts himself NOR motivates others to act. The verb يَحُضُّ (with doubled ض) carries the meaning of strong urging — its negation implies complete apathy toward the suffering of others.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** لَا is لَا النَّافِيَة (negation particle) negating the present tense without changing its mood — يَحُضُّ remains marfu' (indicative). This contrasts with لَمْ which would cause jussive mood. The prepositional phrase عَلَىٰ طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ tells what he fails to encourage. طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ is an idafah where طَعَامِ is majrur by عَلَىٰ and الْمِسْكِينِ is majrur as mudaf ilayhi.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَحُضُّ is from root ح-ض-ض (another doubled/geminate root) on the Form I pattern يَفْعُلُ, meaning "to strongly urge, to encourage." الْمِسْكِين from root س-ك-ن on the مِفْعِيل pattern denotes someone immobilized by poverty — the root itself means "to be still/quiet," and the pattern suggests someone whose poverty has rendered him unable to move or act.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse condemns by indirection: not "he doesn't feed the poor" but "he doesn't even encourage feeding." This is devastatingly effective — it reveals a person so morally bankrupt that even the IDEA of helping the poor doesn't cross his mind, let alone the act itself. The coordination with وَ links this failure to the orphan-repelling in verse 2, building a portrait of comprehensive social cruelty. Both verses use present tense (يَدُعُّ, يَحُضُّ) to indicate these are permanent character traits, not isolated incidents.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَوَيْلٌ لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ"
  transliteration="fa-waylun li-l-musallin"
  translation="So woe to those who pray"
  reference="Al-Ma'un 107:4"

| 4 | لْمُصَلِّينَ | al-musallin | ص ل و | Noun - active participle, masculine, plural, definite | Majrur by li - genitive with ya (sound masculine plural) | those who pray |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="وَيْلٌ: The Exclamatory Threat Construction">
وَيْلٌ لِـ is a threat/curse formula. Grammatically, وَيْلٌ is the mubtada' (subject) and the prepositional phrase لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ is the khabar (predicate). The indefiniteness of وَيْلٌ (with tanwin) intensifies the threat — it is SOME woe, unquantifiable and unspecified destruction. This construction appears multiple times in the Quran (also in 104:1) as a formula of divine condemnation.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Shocking Twist: Woe to Those Who PRAY?">
This verse is deliberately shocking — how can prayer, the most sacred act of worship, bring condemnation? The listener is caught off guard. The answer comes in verses 5-7: it is not prayer itself but prayer without sincerity. The grammatical structure delays the qualification, creating a moment of disorientation that forces the listener to pay attention. This is masterful use of suspense through sentence structure.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ here marks a transition between the surah's two halves. وَيْلٌ is the mubtada', and لِّلْمُصَلِّينَ is the khabar (prepositional phrase in the position of nominative). Some grammarians analyze وَيْلٌ as khabar muqaddam with a deleted mubtada' — either analysis yields the same meaning. الْمُصَلِّينَ is majrur by لِ, taking the ya ending characteristic of sound masculine plurals in the genitive/accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْمُصَلِّينَ is the active participle (ism fa'il) of the Form II verb صَلَّى (to pray), following the مُفَعِّل pattern. The sound masculine plural adds ـينَ in the oblique cases (genitive and accusative). Form II صَلَّى (with doubled lam) is the standard verb for ritual prayer in Arabic, derived from root ص-ل-و.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The فَ connects the two halves of the surah: BECAUSE these people deny judgment (vv1-3), THEREFORE even their prayers bring condemnation (vv4-7). Using an active participle (الْمُصَلِّينَ — "those who are praying ones") rather than a relative clause (الَّذِينَ يُصَلُّونَ — "those who pray") makes prayer their defining identity — they ARE prayers, yet their prayer is condemned. The paradox is the point.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِينَ هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ"
  transliteration="alladhina hum 'an salatihim sahun"
  translation="Who are heedless of their prayer"

| 5 | سَاهُونَ | sahuna | س ه و | Noun - active participle, masculine, plural, indefinite | Khabar (predicate) - nominative (marfu') with waw (sound masculine plural) | heedless, forgetful |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ: 'From' Their Prayer, Not 'In' Their Prayer">
The preposition عَن (from/regarding) is crucial. The verse says they are heedless عَن (FROM/ABOUT) their prayer — not فِي (IN) their prayer. Being heedless IN prayer (momentary distraction) happens to everyone and is forgivable. Being heedless FROM/ABOUT prayer means they don't care about it at all — they delay it, abandon it, or perform it purely for appearance. The preposition choice distinguishes human imperfection from willful neglect.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الَّذِينَ introduces a relative clause qualifying الْمُصَلِّينَ. Inside the clause, هُمْ عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ سَاهُونَ is a nominal sentence: هُمْ (mubtada'), سَاهُونَ (khabar). The prepositional phrase عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ is مُتَعَلِّق بِـ (connected to) سَاهُونَ, specifying what they are heedless of. صَلَاتِهِمْ is majrur by عَن with the attached possessive pronoun هِمْ in the genitive position.

**Sarf (Morphology):** سَاهُونَ is the active participle (ism fa'il) of سَهَا (to be heedless, to forget) on the فَاعِل pattern, in the sound masculine plural (فَاعِلُونَ → سَاهُونَ in nominative). Using the active participle rather than the verb يَسْهُونَ makes heedlessness a permanent state, not a temporary action — they ARE heedless ones by nature.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The nominal sentence structure (هُمْ...سَاهُونَ) emphasizes permanence — this is their constant state, not an occasional lapse. The detached pronoun هُمْ at the start of the clause adds emphasis: THEY specifically are the heedless ones. The preposition عَن (from/about) rather than فِي (in) is a deliberate rhetorical choice that scholars cite as evidence of Quranic precision — it distinguishes between natural human distraction during prayer (forgivable) and fundamental disregard for prayer as an obligation (condemned).

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الَّذِينَ هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ"
  transliteration="alladhina hum yura'un"
  translation="Those who make show of their deeds"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form III يُرَاءُونَ: Worship as Performance">
يُرَاءُونَ is Form III (فَاعَلَ → يُفَاعِلُ) from root ر-أ-ي (to see). Form III indicates directing action TOWARD others — so يُرَاءُونَ literally means "they make others SEE them" or "they do things so that people will observe them." This is the technical term for رِيَاء (showing off in worship) — one of the most condemned spiritual diseases in Islam, where worship becomes performance for human applause rather than divine devotion.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse mirrors verse 5 structurally: الَّذِينَ + هُمْ + predicate. The second الَّذِينَ can be analyzed as either بَدَل (apposition) to the first الَّذِينَ or as a second na't (adjective) to الْمُصَلِّينَ. هُمْ يُرَاءُونَ is a nominal sentence with a verbal khabar — the detached pronoun هُمْ adds emphasis before the verb.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُرَاءُونَ is the present tense of the Form III verb رَاءَى (يُرَائِي), conjugated for the plural. Form III (فَاعَلَ) indicates directing an action toward someone else — the root ر-أ-ي (seeing) becomes "to make others see, to display oneself." The hamza in the middle creates the distinctive pronunciation. The present tense indicates ongoing, habitual behavior.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After establishing that they are heedless OF prayer (v5), the surah reveals WHY they pray at all: for human observers. The Form III pattern (directing action toward others) makes the grammar itself encode the hypocrisy — their worship is not directed toward Allah but toward people. The parallel structure with verse 5 (both starting with الَّذِينَ هُمْ) creates a two-part accusation: they don't care about prayer (سَاهُونَ) AND their prayer is for show (يُرَاءُونَ).

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَيَمْنَعُونَ الْمَاعُونَ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="الْمَاعُون: What Is 'Small Kindness'?">
الْمَاعُون from root م-ع-ن on the فَاعُول pattern refers to the smallest acts of neighborly help: lending a cooking pot, sharing salt, giving a bucket of water. Scholars define it as "what people customarily do not refuse." The devastating irony: these people perform public prayer (a major act) for show, yet refuse a neighbor a cup of sugar (a trivial act). The grammar of the surah builds to this crescendo — their hypocrisy is total, extending from the grandest worship down to the smallest kindness.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَ coordinates this verb with the preceding relative clause, continuing the description of the condemned group. يَمْنَعُونَ is a transitive verb taking الْمَاعُونَ as its direct object (maf'ul bihi, accusative with fatha). The present tense indicates habitual refusal.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَمْنَعُونَ from root م-ن-ع on the Form I pattern يَفْعَلُ means "to withhold, prevent, refuse." الْمَاعُون from root م-ع-ن follows the فَاعُول pattern, which is relatively rare and here denotes an instrument or means of small assistance. Some linguists connect it to مَعُونَة (help, aid), making الْمَاعُون the diminutive or minimal form of help.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends not with a grand theological statement but with the mundane: refusing to lend a neighbor simple household items. This is the final, crushing irony — the surah moves from cosmic theology (denying the Day of Judgment) through social cruelty (orphans, the poor) through spiritual hypocrisy (prayer for show) to arrive at the pettiest possible failure: withholding a cup of salt. The descending scale of the condemnation makes it universal: if you fail at even the smallest kindness, your prayer and your faith are both hollow. The word الْمَاعُونَ, which gives the surah its name, encapsulates its entire message in a single term.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="The surah uses present tense verbs throughout (يُكَذِّبُ, يَدُعُّ, يَحُضُّ, يُرَاءُونَ, يَمْنَعُونَ). Why does the Quran use present tense rather than past tense for these descriptions? What does this grammatical choice communicate about the people being described?">

The present tense (الفعل المضارع) in Arabic indicates **habitual, ongoing, or repeated action** — as opposed to the past tense which would indicate completed, one-time events.

By using present tense for every verb, the surah communicates that:

1. **These are character traits, not incidents.** يُكَذِّبُ (he denies) — he is a denier by nature. يَدُعُّ (he repels) — repelling orphans is his habit. يَمْنَعُونَ (they withhold) — withholding is their constant practice.

2. **The behavior is ongoing.** These people are CURRENTLY doing these things — the present tense creates immediacy and urgency.

3. **The archetype is timeless.** By not anchoring the description in past events, the surah makes this portrait applicable to any era — anyone who exhibits these behaviors falls under the same condemnation.

If the Quran had used past tense (كَذَّبَ, دَعَّ, مَنَعُوا), the implication would be that these were specific historical people who did these things once. The present tense makes the condemnation universal and permanent.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the verb form (I, II, or III) for يُكَذِّبُ, يَدُعُّ, and يُرَاءُونَ. Explain how each form's meaning relates to the surah's theme of hypocrisy.">

**يُكَذِّبُ — Form II (فَعَّلَ):**
- Root: ك ذ ب | Base meaning: to lie
- Form II adds **declarative/intensive meaning**: "to call something a lie, to actively deny"
- Connection to theme: The denier doesn't just passively disbelieve — he **actively declares** the Judgment to be false. Form II's intensity shows this is willful, aggressive rejection.

**يَدُعُّ — Form I (فَعَلَ):**
- Root: د ع ع | Base meaning: to push violently
- Form I is basic, direct action
- Connection to theme: The simplest verb form for the most basic cruelty — no sophistication, no pretense, just raw violence against the weak. The doubled ع makes the sound itself aggressive.

**يُرَاءُونَ — Form III (فَاعَلَ):**
- Root: ر أ ي | Base meaning: to see
- Form III means **directing action toward others**: "to make others see, to show off"
- Connection to theme: This is the grammar of hypocrisy itself. Form III turns "seeing" into "making others see you" — worship becomes performance. The مُفَاعَلَة pattern encodes the very concept of رِيَاء (showing off), where the direction of worship shifts from God to human spectators.

The three forms trace the anatomy of hypocrisy: active denial (Form II) → direct cruelty (Form I) → performative piety (Form III).

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Rhetorical interrogative:** أَرَأَيْتَ draws attention to something condemnable — not a real question
- **Relative clauses:** الَّذِي (singular) in vv1-2, الَّذِينَ (plural) in vv5-6 — shift from archetype to group
- **Consequential فَ:** فَذَٰلِكَ (v2) and فَوَيْلٌ (v4) create cause-and-effect logical chains
- **Exclamatory وَيْلٌ لِـ:** Curse/threat formula with indefinite mubtada' for unspecified destruction
- **Active participles as nouns:** الْمُصَلِّينَ (Form II ism fa'il), سَاهُونَ (Form I ism fa'il)
- **Verb forms encode meaning:** Form II يُكَذِّبُ (intensive denial), Form III يُرَاءُونَ (action toward others)
- **لَا negation:** وَلَا يَحُضُّ — negates present tense without changing mood (stays marfu')
- **Preposition عَن vs. فِي:** عَن صَلَاتِهِمْ (heedless FROM prayer) distinguishes willful neglect from momentary distraction
- **Present tense throughout:** All 5 verbs are mudari', indicating habitual character traits
- **Idafah:** طَعَامِ الْمِسْكِينِ (feeding of the poor)
- **Sound masculine plural case endings:** الْمُصَلِّينَ (ـينَ genitive), سَاهُونَ (ـونَ nominative)
- **Two-part structure:** vv1-3 (singular, social cruelty) → vv4-7 (plural, spiritual hypocrisy)
