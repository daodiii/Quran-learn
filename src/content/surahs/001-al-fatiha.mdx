</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Mother of the Quran">
Al-Fatiha is called Umm al-Quran (Mother of the Quran) because it encapsulates all Quranic themes in just 7 verses and 29 words. Grammatically, it demonstrates nearly every major Arabic sentence structure: nominal sentences, verbal sentences, imperatives, relative clauses, idafa chains, fronted objects for exclusivity, active and passive participles, and three different verb forms (I, IV, X). It also contains one of the most famous rhetorical devices in the Quran — iltifat (person shift) — moving from third person ("praise to Allah") to second person ("You alone we worship") in the middle of the surah.

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | بِسْمِ | bismi | س م و | Preposition + noun - masculine singular, definite (by idafa) | Prepositional phrase (jarr wa-majrūr): بِ is preposition (ḥarf jarr), اسْمِ is genitive (majrūr) | In the name of |
| 2 | اللَّهِ | Allāhi | - | Proper noun - definite | Possessive complement (muḍāf ilayhi) - genitive (majrūr) | Allah |
| 3 | الرَّحْمَـٰنِ | al-raḥmāni | ر ح م | Adjective - masculine singular, definite, pattern فَعْلَان | Apposition (badal) following اللَّهِ - genitive (majrūr) | The Most Gracious |
| 4 | الرَّحِيمِ | al-raḥīmi | ر ح م | Adjective - masculine singular, definite, pattern فَعِيل | Apposition (badal) following اللَّهِ - genitive (majrūr) | The Most Merciful |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Basmala: An Implied Verb">
The بَسْمَلَة (bismillah) is a prepositional phrase with an implied verb. The full meaning is: أَبْدَأُ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ ("I begin in the name of Allah") or اقْرَأْ بِسْمِ اللَّهِ ("Read in the name of Allah"). The preposition بِ governs اسْم in the genitive case. The alif of اسْم is dropped (hamzat al-waṣl) for ease of pronunciation, which is why we say بِسْمِ rather than بِاسْمِ.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Two Patterns of Mercy from One Root">
الرَّحْمَـٰنِ and الرَّحِيمِ both derive from the root ر ح م (mercy) but use different morphological patterns. الرَّحْمَـٰن (pattern فَعْلَان) denotes intense, all-encompassing mercy — overwhelming in scope. الرَّحِيم (pattern فَعِيل) denotes continuous, specific mercy — enduring and targeted. Together they express mercy in both its breadth and depth.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The entire verse is a prepositional phrase (shibh jumlah) functioning as the predicate of an implied nominal sentence. The preposition بِ governs اسْمِ in the genitive. اسْمِ اللَّهِ is an iḍāfah (possessive construction), and الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ are appositions (badal) or adjectives (na't) following اللَّهِ — all in the genitive case to agree with the head noun.

**Sarf (Morphology):** اسْم from root س-م-و on the فِعْل pattern is one of the few words in Arabic that loses its initial hamza in connected speech. الرَّحْمَـٰن follows the فَعْلَان pattern (intensive adjective), while الرَّحِيم follows the فَعِيل pattern (enduring quality). Both derive from the triliteral root ر-ح-م.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The Basmala's placement before every surah (except At-Tawba) establishes mercy as the gateway to all Quranic discourse. The pairing of two mercy-attributes from the same root (jinās ishtiqāqī — paronomasia through derivation) creates emphasis through repetition of the root while varying the meaning through morphological pattern. The implied verb leaves the action open — whether one is reading, writing, eating, or beginning any task, it all falls under Allah's name.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ"
  transliteration="al-ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-'ālamīna"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | الْحَمْدُ | al-ḥamdu | ح م د | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfū') | The praise |
| 2 | لِلَّهِ | lillāhi | - | Preposition + proper noun | Prepositional phrase as predicate (khabar): لِ is preposition (ḥarf jarr), اللَّهِ is genitive (majrūr) | To/for Allah |
| 3 | رَبِّ | rabbi | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine singular, definite (by iḍāfah) | Apposition (badal) of اللَّهِ - genitive (majrūr), muḍāf | Lord |
| 4 | الْعَالَمِينَ | al-'ālamīna | ع ل م | Noun - masculine plural (sound masculine plural), definite | Muḍāf ilayhi - genitive (majrūr), indicated by ـِينَ | The worlds |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="الـ for Totality (Al-Istighrāq)">
The definite article الـ on الْحَمْدُ indicates that ALL praise, without exception, belongs to Allah. This is called الـ الاستغراقية (al-istighrāqiyyah) — the الـ of totality/comprehensiveness. It transforms "praise" into "ALL praise" — every form of praise, in every language, at every time, belongs inherently to Allah. This is not a command ("Praise Allah!") but a statement of fact ("Praise IS Allah's").
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ is a nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah): الْحَمْدُ is the mubtada' (subject, nominative with ḍamma) and the prepositional phrase لِلَّهِ is the khabar (predicate). رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ is an iḍāfah construction functioning as badal (apposition) of اللَّهِ, both in the genitive case. الْعَالَمِينَ is a sound masculine plural showing genitive with ـِينَ ending.

**Sarf (Morphology):** الْحَمْدُ from root ح-م-د on the فَعْل pattern is a maṣdar (verbal noun) meaning "praise." رَبّ from root ر-ب-ب (geminate root, doubled final letter) means "lord, nurturer, sustainer." الْعَالَمِينَ from root ع-ل-م is the sound masculine plural of عَالَم (world/realm).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The choice of a nominal sentence (الْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ) rather than a verbal sentence (أَحْمَدُ اللَّهَ — "I praise Allah") is significant. Nominal sentences in Arabic express permanence and timelessness, while verbal sentences express temporality. By using the nominal form, the Quran declares that praise BELONGS to Allah as an eternal reality — it is not dependent on anyone praising Him. The iḍāfah رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ explains WHY praise belongs to Him: because He is the Lord who nurtures all creation.

### Verse 3

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | الرَّحْمَـٰنِ | al-raḥmāni | ر ح م | Adjective - masculine singular, definite, pattern فَعْلَان | Apposition (badal) of اللَّهِ from verse 2 - genitive (majrūr) | The Most Gracious |
| 2 | الرَّحِيمِ | al-raḥīmi | ر ح م | Adjective - masculine singular, definite, pattern فَعِيل | Apposition (badal) of اللَّهِ from verse 2 - genitive (majrūr) | The Most Merciful |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Case Agreement Across Verse Boundaries">
Both الرَّحْمَـٰنِ and الرَّحِيمِ remain in the genitive case (kasra) because they are still describing اللَّهِ from verse 2. In Arabic grammar, appositions (badal) or adjectives (na't) must agree with the noun they describe in case, definiteness, gender, and number — even when separated by a verse boundary. The genitive case here flows from لِلَّهِ in verse 2.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse continues the grammatical structure of verse 2. Both words are appositions (badal) or adjectives (na't) of اللَّهِ, maintaining genitive case agreement. The verse has no independent syntactic structure — it is grammatically embedded in the preceding verse.

**Sarf (Morphology):** The two words share the root ر-ح-م but use different patterns: الرَّحْمَـٰن on فَعْلَان (intensive, temporary quality taken to extreme) and الرَّحِيم on فَعِيل (enduring, permanent quality). This morphological contrast creates a comprehensive picture of divine mercy.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition of الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ from the Basmala (verse 1) is deliberate. In the Basmala, these attributes introduce the act of reading. Here, they explain the nature of the Lord of the Worlds. The repetition reinforces mercy as the defining attribute of Allah — mentioned four times in just three verses. Giving these two words their own verse (rather than appending them to verse 2) elevates mercy to a standalone declaration.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ"
  transliteration="māliki yawmi d-dīni"
  translation="Master of the Day of Judgment"

  highlight="مَالِكِ"
  words={[
    { ar: "مَالِكِ", tr: "māliki", en: "Master/Owner" },
    { ar: "يَوْمِ", tr: "yawmi", en: "Day" },
    { ar: "الدِّينِ", tr: "al-dīni", en: "The Judgment" }
  ]}
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | مَالِكِ | māliki | م ل ك | Active participle (ism al-fā'il) - masculine singular, definite (by iḍāfah), pattern فَاعِل | Apposition (badal) of اللَّهِ from verse 2 - genitive (majrūr), muḍāf | Master/Owner |
| 2 | يَوْمِ | yawmi | ي و م | Noun - masculine singular, definite (by iḍāfah) | Muḍāf ilayhi of مَالِكِ - genitive (majrūr), also muḍāf | Day |
| 3 | الدِّينِ | al-dīni | د ي ن | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Muḍāf ilayhi of يَوْمِ - genitive (majrūr) | The Judgment |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Triple Iḍāfah Chain">
مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ contains a chain of two nested iḍāfah constructions: مَالِكِ → يَوْمِ → الدِّينِ. The first iḍāfah is "Master of [the] Day" and the second is "Day of [the] Judgment." All three words are genitive: مَالِكِ because it is badal of اللَّهِ, يَوْمِ because it is muḍāf ilayhi of مَالِكِ, and الدِّينِ because it is muḍāf ilayhi of يَوْمِ.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Two Accepted Readings: مَالِكِ vs مَلِكِ">
In the qirā'a (reading) of مَلِكِ (without alif), the pattern is فَعِل meaning "king/sovereign" — emphasizing authority and rule. The reading مَالِكِ (with alif) on the pattern فَاعِل means "owner/possessor" — emphasizing ownership and control. Both are mutawātir (mass-transmitted) readings. The difference: a مَلِك rules over subjects, while a مَالِك owns everything including the subjects themselves.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** مَالِكِ continues the chain of descriptions of اللَّهِ from verse 2, functioning as another badal (apposition) in the genitive case. The double iḍāfah chain مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ creates a compact three-word phrase expressing a complex concept. Each word governs the next in the genitive.

**Sarf (Morphology):** مَالِكِ is an active participle (ism al-fā'il) from root م-ل-ك on the فَاعِل pattern — "the one who possesses." يَوْمِ from root ي-و-م on the فَعْل pattern is a basic noun. الدِّينِ from root د-ي-ن carries meanings of both "judgment/recompense" and "religion/way of life" — here specifically meaning judgment and accountability.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After establishing Allah's mercy (verses 1-3), verse 4 introduces His authority and justice. This pairing — mercy before sovereignty — is deliberate: it assures the listener that the Judge is merciful before revealing that He is the absolute owner of Judgment Day. The word يَوْم (day) specifies a particular moment, while مَالِكِ implies total ownership of that moment and everything in it. The definite article on الدِّينِ points to THE Day of Judgment — the specific, known, inevitable event.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِيَّاكَ | iyyāka | - | Pronoun - detached accusative, 2nd person masculine singular | Object (maf'ūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb), fronted for exclusivity (ḥaṣr) | You (alone) |
| 2 | نَعْبُدُ | na'budu | ع ب د | Verb - Form I, present tense, 1st person plural | Present indicative verb (fi'l muḍāri' marfū'), subject is implied nahnu | We worship |
| 3 | وَإِيَّاكَ | wa-iyyāka | - | Conjunction + pronoun - detached accusative | Coordinating conjunction + fronted object (maf'ūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb) | And You (alone) |
| 4 | نَسْتَعِينُ | nasta'īnu | ع و ن | Verb - Form X, present tense, 1st person plural | Present indicative verb (fi'l muḍāri' marfū'), subject is implied nahnu | We seek help |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Ḥaṣr: Fronting the Object for Exclusivity">
The normal Arabic word order would be نَعْبُدُكَ ("we worship You"). But the Quran fronts the object إِيَّاكَ before the verb, creating ḥaṣr (restriction/exclusivity): "You ALONE we worship." This is not merely "we worship You" but "it is You — and no one else — that we worship." The parallel structure (إِيَّاكَ...وَإِيَّاكَ) repeats this exclusivity for both worship and seeking help.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Great Iltifāt: Third to Second Person">
This verse marks one of the most famous rhetorical shifts (iltifāt) in Arabic literature. Verses 1-4 speak ABOUT Allah in the third person ("praise to Allah," "Lord of the worlds"). Suddenly in verse 5, the speaker addresses Allah directly in the second person ("YOU alone we worship"). This shift creates dramatic immediacy — as if the act of praising Allah's attributes brings the worshipper so close that they can now speak directly to Him.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Both clauses follow the same pattern: fronted object (إِيَّاكَ) + verb (نَعْبُدُ / نَسْتَعِينُ). The fronting of the maf'ūl bihi before the fi'l creates ḥaṣr (exclusivity). Both verbs are present tense indicative (marfū'), expressing ongoing, habitual action. The coordinating conjunction وَ links the two parallel clauses.

**Sarf (Morphology):** نَعْبُدُ is Form I (basic) from root ع-ب-د, meaning simple worship. نَسْتَعِينُ is Form X (اِسْتَفْعَلَ) from root ع-و-ن — Form X adds "seeking/requesting" to the base meaning, so while عَانَ means "to help," اسْتَعَانَ means "to seek help." The progression from Form I to Form X mirrors a theological progression: first worship, then reliance.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The iltifāt (person shift) from third to second person is the rhetorical centerpiece of Al-Fatiha. The parallel structure creates perfect balance — two short, punchy declarations of exclusive devotion. Worship (نَعْبُدُ) comes before seeking help (نَسْتَعِينُ) because worship establishes the relationship that qualifies one to ask. The use of "we" (plural) rather than "I" (singular) expresses communal worship — the individual joins the ummah in addressing Allah.

### Verse 6

| 1 | اهْدِنَا | ihdinā | ه د ي | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person masculine singular + attached pronoun 1st person plural | Imperative verb (fi'l amr) - mabnī; نَا is first direct object (maf'ūl bihi awwal) - accusative (manṣūb) | Guide us |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Double-Object Verb (Muta'addī ilā Maf'ūlayn)">
اهْدِ is one of the verbs that takes two objects: the first is نَا (us) — WHO is being guided — and the second is الصِّرَاطَ (the path) — WHAT they are being guided to. Both objects are in the accusative case. The hamza at the beginning of اهْدِ is hamzat al-waṣl (connective hamza) that appears in imperative verbs of Form I when the middle radical has kasra.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** اهْدِنَا is an imperative verb taking two objects (muta'addī ilā maf'ūlayn). The first object is the attached pronoun نَا (us), and the second is الصِّرَاطَ (the path). الْمُسْتَقِيمَ is an adjective (na't) agreeing with الصِّرَاطَ in definiteness, case (accusative), gender, and number.

**Sarf (Morphology):** اهْدِ from root ه-د-ي is a defective verb (the final radical is weak — ي). In the imperative, the final ي drops, leaving اهْدِ. الْمُسْتَقِيمَ is a Form X active participle from root ق-و-م — Form X here means "seeking to be upright/straight," resulting in "the straight/upright one." الصِّرَاطَ uses the emphatic ص instead of the standard س, which is characteristic of Quranic orthography.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse transitions from declaration (verse 5) to supplication (du'ā'). Having established exclusive worship and reliance on Allah, the worshipper now asks for the most essential thing: guidance. The definiteness of الصِّرَاطَ (THE path) with الْمُسْتَقِيمَ (THE straight) implies there is ONE specific path, not multiple valid paths. The Form X participle الْمُسْتَقِيمَ adds nuance — this path doesn't merely happen to be straight; it actively "seeks uprightness," suggesting a living, dynamic guidance.

<Callout type="rule" title="Active vs Passive Participles: Agent vs Patient">
This verse contrasts two types of participles: الْمَغْضُوبِ is a passive participle (ism al-maf'ūl — pattern مَفْعُول) meaning "those who ARE angered upon" — the agent of anger is deliberately left unmentioned (divine displeasure). الضَّالِّينَ is an active participle (ism al-fā'il — pattern فَاعِل, sound masculine plural) meaning "those who ACTIVELY go astray" — they are the agents of their own misguidance.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Relative Clause and Its Return Pronoun">
الَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ is a relative clause (ṣilat al-mawṣūl). Every relative clause in Arabic requires a "return pronoun" (ḍamīr 'ā'id) that refers back to the relative pronoun. Here, هِمْ in عَلَيْهِمْ is the return pronoun referring back to الَّذِينَ. Without this return pronoun, the relative clause would be grammatically incomplete.

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ is an iḍāfah construction serving as badal (apposition) clarifying الصِّرَاطَ الْمُسْتَقِيمَ from verse 6. الَّذِينَ introduces a relative clause (ṣilat al-mawṣūl): أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ — "You bestowed favor upon them." غَيْرِ acts as an exclusion word, governing الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ and وَلَا الضَّالِّينَ — excluding two groups from the blessed path.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَنْعَمْتَ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) from root ن-ع-م — Form IV adds transitivity and causation, so while نَعِمَ means "to be comfortable/blessed," أَنْعَمَ means "to bestow blessing upon." الْمَغْضُوبِ is a passive participle (مَفْعُول) from root غ-ض-ب. الضَّالِّينَ is an active participle (فَاعِل) from root ض-ل-ل — the doubled ل (geminate root) produces the shadda in الضَّالِّينَ. The ـِينَ ending marks genitive case in sound masculine plurals.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse defines the straight path by both inclusion and exclusion — positively as the path of the blessed, and negatively as NOT the path of two deviant groups. The passive construction الْمَغْضُوبِ عَلَيْهِمْ (those angered upon) deliberately omits the agent of anger, creating a sense of overwhelming divine displeasure from an unnamed source. In contrast, الضَّالِّينَ (those who go astray) uses the active voice — they are agents of their own misguidance. This grammatical contrast implies that one group provoked anger through willful transgression, while the other wandered away through negligence.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Identify every iḍāfah (possessive construction) in Al-Fatiha. For each, state the muḍāf and muḍāf ilayhi, and explain how the case of each is determined.">

**1. اسْمِ اللَّهِ (Verse 1)**
- Muḍāf: اسْمِ — genitive (governed by preposition بِ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: اللَّهِ — genitive (always genitive in iḍāfah)
- Meaning: "name of Allah"

**2. رَبِّ الْعَالَمِينَ (Verse 2)**
- Muḍāf: رَبِّ — genitive (badal of اللَّهِ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: الْعَالَمِينَ — genitive (sound masculine plural, shown by ـِينَ)
- Meaning: "Lord of the worlds"

**3. مَالِكِ يَوْمِ (Verse 4)**
- Muḍāf: مَالِكِ — genitive (badal of اللَّهِ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: يَوْمِ — genitive
- Meaning: "Master of [the] Day"

**4. يَوْمِ الدِّينِ (Verse 4)**
- Muḍāf: يَوْمِ — genitive (muḍāf ilayhi of مَالِكِ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: الدِّينِ — genitive
- Meaning: "Day of Judgment"

**5. صِرَاطَ الَّذِينَ (Verse 7)**
- Muḍāf: صِرَاطَ — accusative (badal of الصِّرَاطَ)
- Muḍāf ilayhi: الَّذِينَ — genitive (relative pronoun)
- Meaning: "path of those who"

**Key rule:** The muḍāf drops its tanwin and definite article. The muḍāf ilayhi is always genitive. The case of the muḍāf is determined by its grammatical role in the sentence (subject = nominative, object = accusative, after preposition = genitive).

<ExerciseBox question="Al-Fatiha uses three different verb forms: Form I (نَعْبُدُ), Form IV (أَنْعَمْتَ), and Form X (نَسْتَعِينُ). Explain what each form adds to its root meaning and identify the root of each.">

**Form I — نَعْبُدُ (root: ع-ب-د)**
- **Base meaning:** عَبَدَ = "to worship, to serve"
- **Form I function:** Basic, unaugmented meaning — simple worship
- **In context:** "We worship" — expressing the fundamental act of devotion

**Form IV — أَنْعَمْتَ (root: ن-ع-م)**
- **Base meaning:** نَعِمَ = "to be comfortable, to enjoy blessings"
- **Form IV meaning:** أَنْعَمَ = "to bestow blessings upon"
- **What Form IV adds:** Transitivity and causation — transforming an intransitive state ("being blessed") into a transitive action ("bestowing blessings")
- **In context:** "You bestowed favor" — Allah actively grants blessings to people

**Form X — نَسْتَعِينُ (root: ع-و-ن)**
- **Base meaning:** عَانَ = "to help"
- **Form X meaning:** اسْتَعَانَ = "to seek help"
- **What Form X adds:** The meaning of "seeking/requesting" the base action
- **In context:** "We seek help" — not performing help but requesting it from Allah

**Insight:** The surah progresses from basic worship (Form I) to seeking help (Form X), mirroring the spiritual journey — first you worship, then you are qualified to ask.

<ExerciseBox question="Explain the iltifāt (person shift) in Al-Fatiha. Which verses use third person and which use second person? What is the rhetorical effect of this shift?">

**Third person (verses 1-4):**
- V1: بِسْمِ اللَّهِ — "In the name of **Allah**" (speaking about Allah)
- V2: الْحَمْدُ **لِلَّهِ** — "Praise is for **Allah**" (speaking about Allah)
- V3: الرَّحْمَـٰنِ الرَّحِيمِ — "**The** Most Gracious, **the** Most Merciful" (describing Allah)
- V4: مَالِكِ يَوْمِ الدِّينِ — "Master of the Day of Judgment" (describing Allah)

**Second person (verses 5-7):**
- V5: إِيَّا**كَ** نَعْبُدُ — "**You** alone we worship" (addressing Allah directly)
- V6: اهْدِ**نَا** — "Guide **us**" (supplicating Allah directly)
- V7: أَنْعَمْ**تَ** — "**You** bestowed" (speaking to Allah directly)

**Rhetorical effect:** The shift creates a sense of drawing near. The worshipper begins by praising Allah's attributes from a distance (third person), building a sense of awe and recognition. By verse 5, the accumulation of praise — His lordship, mercy, and sovereignty — has brought the worshipper so close that they can no longer speak about Him but must speak TO Him. The iltifāt transforms the surah from description to conversation, from theology to intimacy.
