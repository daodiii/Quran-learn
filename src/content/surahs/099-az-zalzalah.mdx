# Az-Zalzalah (The Earthquake)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Medinan
- **Verses:** 8
- **Theme:** This surah describes the tremendous earthquake that will occur on the Day of Resurrection, when the earth will reveal its secrets, and every person will see the results of their deeds — even the smallest good or evil will be accounted for.
- **Grammar Focus:** Conditional idhā (إِذَا) constructions, passive voice verbs, maf'ūl muṭlaq (مَفْعُول مُطْلَق), quadriliteral roots, man conditional with jussive, tamyīz (تَمْيِيز) constructions, and perfect parallelism.

### Structural Overview

| 1 | إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا | Verbal (conditional) | إِذَا + passive + مَفْعُول مُطْلَق | Earth shaken with its ultimate quake |
| 2 | وَأَخْرَجَتِ الْأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا | Verbal (past) | Form IV active verb | Earth expels its buried contents |
| 3 | وَقَالَ الْإِنسَانُ مَا لَهَا | Verbal (past) + direct speech | Interrogative مَا + idiomatic لَهَا | Humanity's bewildered question |
| 4 | يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا | Verbal (present) | يَوْمَئِذٍ temporal + Form II verb | Earth testifies as witness |
| 5 | بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا | Nominal (بِأَنَّ clause) | بِ causal + أَنَّ assertion | Divine command authorizes earth's speech |
| 6 | يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ | Verbal (present) | حَال + لِ purpose + passive subjunctive | Humanity sorted to view their deeds |
| 7 | فَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ خَيْرًا يَرَهُ | Verbal (conditional) | مَنْ + jussive + مِثْقَال iḍāfa + تَمْيِيز | Atom's weight of good is seen |
| 8 | وَمَن يَعْمَلْ مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ شَرًّا يَرَهُ | Verbal (conditional) | Exact parallel — only تَمْيِيز changes | Atom's weight of evil is seen |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Surah of Total Accountability">
Az-Zalzalah is built on a single architectural idea: a conditional sentence that begins in verse 1 (إِذَا — "when") and does not reach its answer until verse 4 (تُحَدِّثُ — "it will report"). This four-verse suspension builds dramatic tension: the earth shakes, expels its contents, humanity cries out in confusion — and only then does the answer arrive. The surah then pivots to the famous closing couplet (verses 7-8), where perfect grammatical parallelism — identical in every word except خَيْرًا vs. شَرًّا — encodes absolute justice: good and evil receive identical treatment, down to the weight of an atom.

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِذَا | idhā | - | Particle - temporal/conditional | Not declinable (mabni) | When |
| 2 | زُلْزِلَتِ | zulzilati | ز ل ز ل | Verb - quadriliteral passive, past, 3f.sg. | Past passive verb (mabni), condition of idhā | It was shaken/quaked |

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Quadriliteral Root ز-ل-ز-ل: Reduplication for Intensity">
Most Arabic roots are triliteral (three letters), but ز-ل-ز-ل is quadriliteral — formed by reduplicating the biliteral base ز-ل (to shake). This reduplication is not decorative; it encodes *repeated, violent action*. Compare: وَسْوَسَ (to whisper repeatedly, from و-س), زَحْزَحَ (to push away forcefully, from ز-ح). The passive form زُلْزِلَتِ follows the pattern فُعْلِلَت, and its cognate noun زِلْزَال follows فِعْلَال — both patterns reserved for quadriliteral roots. The sound itself mimics the earthquake: the repetition of ز-ل, ز-ل echoes the shaking back and forth.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="مَفْعُول مُطْلَق: 'Shaken with Its Shaking'">
زِلْزَالَهَا is a cognate accusative (مَفْعُول مُطْلَق) — a noun derived from the same root as the verb, placed in the accusative to intensify the action. "Shaken with its shaking" means "shaken to the utmost extent of its shaking." The attached pronoun هَا (her/its) refers to الْأَرْض (the earth), making this not just any earthquake but *the earth's own* ultimate, final earthquake — the one it was destined for.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse opens a conditional sentence with إِذَا that will not receive its answer (جَوَاب الشَّرْط) until verse 4. إِذَا is a temporal conditional particle indicating a certain future event ("when," not "if"). The verb زُلْزِلَتِ is passive (مَبْنِي لِلْمَجْهُول), making الْأَرْضُ the deputy subject (نَائِب الفَاعِل) in the nominative. زِلْزَالَهَا is the cognate accusative (مَفْعُول مُطْلَق) in the manṣūb case.

**Sarf (Morphology):** زُلْزِلَتِ follows the quadriliteral passive pattern فُعْلِلَت. The root ز-ل-ز-ل is formed by reduplicating the biliteral ز-ل. The feminine marker تِ (tā' ta'nīth) agrees with the feminine noun الْأَرْض. The cognate noun زِلْزَال follows the فِعْلَال pattern, characteristic of quadriliteral verbal nouns.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with إِذَا creates immediate dramatic tension — the listener waits for the consequence. The passive voice conceals the agent: the earth "is shaken" without stating by whom, because the agent (Allah) is too mighty to name directly in this context of cosmic destruction. The مَفْعُول مُطْلَق construction — "shaken with its shaking" — is emphatic beyond what any adjective could achieve. The possessive pronoun ("its earthquake") implies this is the earthquake the earth has been carrying within itself, waiting to release.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَخْرَجَتِ الْأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا"
  transliteration="wa-akhrajati l-arḍu athqālahā"
  translation="And the earth discharges its burdens"

/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |

| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | And |
| 2 | أَخْرَجَتِ | akhrajat | خ ر ج | Verb - Form IV, past, 3f.sg. | Past verb (mabni), tā' ta'nīth | It brought forth/expelled |
| 3 | الْأَرْضُ | al-arḍu | أ ر ض | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (fā'il) - nominative (marfū') | The earth |
| 4 | أَثْقَالَهَا | athqālahā | ث ق ل | Noun - masculine, broken plural + pronoun | Direct object (maf'ūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb) | Its burdens/loads |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive → Active Voice Shift: Earth as Agent">
Verse 1 used the passive voice (زُلْزِلَتِ — "was shaken"), casting the earth as a passive recipient of divine action. Verse 2 switches to the active voice (أَخْرَجَتِ — "it brought forth"), making the earth an active subject. This shift is purposeful: the earth is first acted upon by Allah's command, then responds by actively ejecting its contents. The grammatical transition mirrors the physical sequence — first the earthquake (external force), then the earth's own reaction (internal release). Form IV أَخْرَجَ (to cause to exit) is causative: the earth *causes* what is inside to come out.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verbal sentence is coordinated with the previous verse by وَ (conjunction). The verb أَخْرَجَتِ is past tense with the feminine marker تِ agreeing with الْأَرْضُ, which is now the active subject (فَاعِل) in the nominative — contrasting with its role as deputy subject in verse 1. أَثْقَالَهَا is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative, with the attached pronoun هَا referring back to الْأَرْض.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَخْرَجَتِ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from root خ-ر-ج. Form I خَرَجَ means "to exit"; Form IV أَخْرَجَ means "to cause to exit, to expel." This causative pattern is productive: دَخَلَ (entered) → أَدْخَلَ (caused to enter); نَزَلَ (descended) → أَنْزَلَ (sent down). أَثْقَال is the broken plural of ثِقْل (burden/weight) on the أَفْعَال pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The earth is personified — it actively ejects its contents like a body expelling what it has swallowed. The word أَثْقَال (burdens) implies that what the earth has been holding — the dead, minerals, secrets — has been heavy. The possessive pronoun هَا ("its burdens") suggests these are not foreign objects but the earth's own responsibility, which it now discharges. The eschatological imagery is powerful: the earth, which silently buried everything throughout history, now reverses the process.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَقَالَ الْإِنسَانُ مَا لَهَا"
  transliteration="wa-qāla l-insānu mā lahā"
  translation="And man says, 'What is [the matter] with it?'"
  reference="Az-Zalzalah 99:3"
  highlight="مَا لَهَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | And |
| 2 | قَالَ | qāla | ق و ل | Verb - Form I, past, 3m.sg. | Past verb (mabni) | He said |
| 3 | الْإِنسَانُ | al-insānu | أ ن س | Noun - masculine, singular, definite | Subject (fā'il) - nominative (marfū') | The human/mankind |
| 4 | مَا | mā | - | Particle - interrogative | Not declinable (mabni) | What |
| 5 | لَهَا | lahā | - | Preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun in genitive place | To it/for it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="مَا لَهَا: The Idiom of Bewilderment">
مَا لَهَا literally translates as "What [is] to/for it?" but functions idiomatically as "What is the matter with it?" or "What is wrong with it?" This construction (مَا + لِ + pronoun) appears throughout Arabic to express shock or bewilderment. Compare: مَا لَكَ ("What's wrong with you?"), مَا لَهُمْ ("What's the matter with them?"). The interrogative مَا here is not seeking information — it is expressing existential terror. Mankind asks this question not because they expect an answer, but because the event exceeds all comprehension.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** قَالَ introduces direct speech — the quoted question مَا لَهَا. The subject الْإِنسَانُ is definite with الـ, indicating the generic human (mankind as a whole). The quoted speech مَا لَهَا is a nominal sentence: مَا is the subject (مُبْتَدَأ) and لَهَا is the predicate (خَبَر) — "What [is the matter] with it?"

**Sarf (Morphology):** قَالَ is a Form I hollow verb from root ق-و-ل, where the middle radical واو transforms in conjugation. الْإِنسَان is from root أ-ن-س on the إِفْعَال pattern, a noun denoting the human species generically.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Inserting the human reaction between the cosmic events (verses 1-2) and their explanation (verses 4-5) creates a dramatic pause. The question مَا لَهَا is deliberately simple and helpless — when faced with the ultimate earthquake, sophisticated language fails, and only the most basic question remains. The use of past tense قَالَ for a future event is a Quranic rhetorical device: describing the future in past tense to convey absolute certainty, as though it has already occurred.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا"
  transliteration="yawma'idhin tuḥaddithu akhbārahā"
  translation="That Day, it will report its news"
  reference="Az-Zalzalah 99:4"
  highlight="يَوْمَئِذٍ,تُحَدِّثُ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | يَوْمَئِذٍ | yawma'idhin | ي و م | Compound noun + particle | Adverb of time (ẓarf zamān) - accusative (manṣūb) | That Day |
| 2 | تُحَدِّثُ | tuḥaddithu | ح د ث | Verb - Form II, present, 3f.sg. | Present indicative (marfū'), jawāb al-sharṭ | It tells/reports |
| 3 | أَخْبَارَهَا | akhbārahā | خ ب ر | Noun - masculine, broken plural + pronoun | Direct object (maf'ūl bihi) - accusative (manṣūb) | Its news/reports |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="يَوْمَئِذٍ: Compound Temporal Adverb">
يَوْمَئِذٍ is a compound of three parts: يَوْم (day) + إِذْ (then/that time) + tanwīn (ٍ). يَوْم is in the accusative as an adverb of time (ظَرْف زَمَان). إِذْ is an indeclinable particle meaning "then/that time." The tanwīn at the end is a compensation (عِوَض) for a deleted clause — the full form would be يَوْمَ إِذْ يَكُونُ كَذَا (on the day when such-and-such happens), but the clause is omitted and replaced by tanwīn. This compound appears frequently in eschatological passages.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Delayed Answer: Four Verses of Suspense">
Verse 4 finally provides the answer (جَوَاب الشَّرْط) to the conditional إِذَا from verse 1. The full structure spanning four verses is: "When the earth is shaken (v.1) and brings forth its burdens (v.2) and man asks what is wrong (v.3) — [then] that Day it will report its news (v.4)." The three-verse delay between condition and answer is extraordinary — it forces the listener to hold the entire catastrophe in mind before learning the outcome. Form II تُحَدِّثُ (intensive of حَدَّثَ) means "to report in detail" — the earth won't just whisper but will narrate fully.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَوْمَئِذٍ functions as an adverb of time (ظَرْف زَمَان) in the accusative. تُحَدِّثُ is the answer to the conditional (جَوَاب الشَّرْط) begun in verse 1 with إِذَا. The present tense verb (مُضَارِع مَرْفُوع) is in the indicative, with its implied subject (هِيَ — the earth). أَخْبَارَهَا is the direct object (مَفْعُول بِهِ) in the accusative.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تُحَدِّثُ is Form II (فَعَّلَ pattern) from root ح-د-ث, characterized by the doubled middle radical (shadda on the dāl). Form II often adds intensity or transitivity: حَدَثَ (it happened) → حَدَّثَ (he narrated/reported in detail). أَخْبَار is the broken plural of خَبَر (news/report) on the أَفْعَال pattern.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The earth is personified as a witness (شَاهِد) who will testify on Judgment Day. The verb تُحَدِّثُ (to narrate/report) is chosen over simpler alternatives like تَقُول (to say) because it implies detailed, informed testimony — the earth has been recording events throughout history. The possessive أَخْبَارَهَا ("its news") reinforces that these are the earth's own observations, not hearsay. This is among the Quran's most vivid personifications: the silent, patient earth finally speaks.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا"
  transliteration="bi-anna rabbaka awḥā lahā"
  translation="Because your Lord has commanded it"
  reference="Az-Zalzalah 99:5"

| 2 | أَنَّ | anna | - | Particle - emphasis/assertion | Not declinable (mabni), governs accusative | That/indeed |
| 3 | رَبَّكَ | rabbaka | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine, singular + pronoun | Ism of anna - accusative (manṣūb) | Your Lord |
| 4 | أَوْحَىٰ | awḥā | و ح ي | Verb - Form IV, past, 3m.sg. | Khabar of anna - verbal sentence | He revealed/inspired/commanded |
| 5 | لَهَا | lahā | - | Preposition + attached pronoun | Preposition + pronoun in genitive place | To it |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="بِأَنَّ: Causal Clause Construction">
بِ here is a preposition of causation (سَبَبِيَّة), and أَنَّ is an assertion particle that governs the accusative. Together, بِأَنَّ means "because" or "due to the fact that." The entire clause بِأَنَّ رَبَّكَ أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا is a causal adjunct explaining *why* the earth will testify. The structure is: بِ (because) + أَنَّ (that indeed) + ism of anna (رَبَّكَ, accusative) + khabar of anna (أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا, verbal sentence). This causal بِأَنَّ pattern appears throughout the Quran to provide divine explanations.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The preposition بِ attaches to أَنَّ forming a causal clause. أَنَّ governs رَبَّكَ as its ism (subject) in the accusative, and the verbal sentence أَوْحَىٰ لَهَا functions as the khabar (predicate). The entire بِأَنَّ clause is connected to تُحَدِّثُ in verse 4 — providing the reason for the earth's testimony.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَوْحَىٰ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern) from the weak root و-ح-ي. Form IV adds causative meaning: وَحَى (rare Form I) → أَوْحَى (to reveal, inspire, command). This verb is reserved almost exclusively for Divine communication in Quranic usage. The alif maqṣūra (ىٰ) at the end indicates a defective verb with a weak final radical.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse answers an implied question: "How can the earth speak?" The answer is devastating in its simplicity: because Allah commanded it. The earth does not speak autonomously — it speaks by Divine authorization (وَحْي). Using رَبَّكَ (your Lord) with the second-person pronoun addresses the Prophet directly, maintaining the intimate tone. The brevity of the explanation — just five words — contrasts with the dramatic events described in verses 1-4, as though the cosmic upheaval needs only a simple divine command to be set in motion.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَئِذٍ يَصْدُرُ النَّاسُ أَشْتَاتًا لِّيُرَوْا أَعْمَالَهُمْ"
  transliteration="yawma'idhin yaṣduru n-nāsu ashtātan li-yuraw a'mālahum"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="لِ + Subjunctive: Purpose Clause Construction">
لِ here is the lām of purpose (لَام التَّعْلِيل), which causes the following verb to take the subjunctive mood (مَنْصُوب) via the implied أَنْ. يُرَوْا is passive Form IV subjunctive of رَأَى (to see) — literally "they be shown." The original active construction would be لِيُرِيَهُمُ اللهُ أَعْمَالَهُمْ (so that Allah shows them their deeds). In the passive, the original first object (them) becomes the subject, and the second object (أَعْمَالَهُمْ, their deeds) remains accusative. This double-object passive is a hallmark of Arabic grammar.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَوْمَئِذٍ is again an adverb of time (ظَرْف زَمَان). يَصْدُرُ is the present indicative verb with النَّاسُ as its subject (فَاعِل). أَشْتَاتًا is a ḥāl (حَال) — an accusative noun describing the state of the people as they depart: "in scattered groups." The لِ + يُرَوْا clause is a purpose construction (مَفْعُول لِأَجْلِهِ): "in order that they be shown."

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَصْدُرُ is Form I from root ص-د-ر (related to صَدْر, chest — "to emerge from"). أَشْتَات is the broken plural of شَتّ (scattered) on the أَفْعَال pattern. يُرَوْا is Form IV passive (أُرِيَ → يُرَى) from the hollow root ر-أ-ي; the subjunctive is marked by deletion of the final نُون (يُرَوْنَ → يُرَوْا).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verb يَصْدُرُ (to depart/emerge) is usually used for animals leaving a watering place — its use for humans on Judgment Day subtly suggests that people will move with the urgency and lack of individual control of a herd. أَشْتَاتًا (scattered groups) implies not random scattering but categorical separation: righteous from wicked, believers from disbelievers. The purpose clause لِّيُرَوْا ("to be shown") uses the passive deliberately — they don't choose to see their deeds; they are *made* to see them, whether they want to or not.

### Verse 7

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="مَنْ Conditional: Jussive in Both Condition and Answer">
مَنْ (whoever) functions as a conditional particle (أَدَاة شَرْط جَازِمَة) that governs two verbs in the jussive mood: the condition (فِعْل الشَّرْط) and its answer (جَوَاب الشَّرْط). Here: يَعْمَلْ (condition, jussive marked by sukūn) and يَرَهُ (answer, jussive — the original form يَرَاهُ loses its alif in the jussive: يَرَى → يَرَ). This is one of the clearest examples of the jussive conditional pattern in the Quran.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="تَمْيِيز: Specification with خَيْرًا">
خَيْرًا is a tamyīz (تَمْيِيز) — a specification noun in the accusative that clarifies the type or nature of a vague element. مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ ("atom's weight") tells us the *quantity*, but of what? The tamyīz خَيْرًا answers: "of good." Without it, the phrase would be incomplete — "Whoever does an atom's weight [of what?]." Tamyīz always appears as an indefinite accusative noun after the element it specifies.

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ introduces the consequence of the Day's events. مَنْ is a conditional pronoun governing the jussive in both clauses. يَعْمَلْ is the condition verb (فِعْل الشَّرْط, majzūm). مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ is the direct object — an iḍāfa (possessive) construction where مِثْقَال is the muḍāf (accusative) and ذَرَّة is the muḍāf ilayh (genitive). خَيْرًا is the tamyīz (specification, accusative). يَرَهُ is the answer verb (جَوَاب الشَّرْط, majzūm), with the attached pronoun هُ as the object (referring to the deed).

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَعْمَلْ is Form I present jussive from root ع-م-ل; the jussive is marked by sukūn. مِثْقَال is an instrument/quantity noun (مِفْعَال pattern) from root ث-ق-ل (heaviness). ذَرَّة is from root ذ-ر-ر on the فَعْلَة pattern — its original meaning is "ant" or "smallest particle." يَرَهُ is a defective verb (ر-أ-ي) in the jussive: يَرَى → يَرَ (the final alif drops in the jussive, marked by deletion of the weak letter).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This is one of the most quoted verses in the Quran, and its power comes from the extreme specificity of the measurement: مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ — the weight of the smallest conceivable particle. The message is absolute: no deed, however microscopic, escapes divine accounting. The verb يَرَهُ (he will *see* it) makes the encounter visceral — it is not merely recorded or mentioned but visually witnessed. The فَ connecting this to the preceding verses positions this as the ultimate purpose of all the cosmic events: the earthquake, the earth's testimony, the gathering of humanity — all lead to this moment of seeing one's deeds.

<Callout type="rule" title="Perfect Parallelism: Grammatical Mirror for Absolute Justice">
Verse 8 is an exact grammatical mirror of verse 7 — every word occupies the same syntactic position, every morphological form is identical, and only the tamyīz changes: خَيْرًا (good) → شَرًّا (evil). This is deliberate parallelism (مُوَازَاة) encoding a theological principle: good and evil receive precisely equal treatment in divine accounting. The conjunction وَ (and) replaces فَ (so) from verse 7, indicating that this is a complementary statement, not a consequence — both truths stand side by side with equal weight.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Grammatically identical to verse 7. وَ replaces فَ as the opening conjunction. مَنْ governs the jussive in يَعْمَلْ (condition) and يَرَهُ (answer). مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ is the iḍāfa direct object. شَرًّا is the tamyīz. The pronoun هُ in يَرَهُ refers to the atom's weight of evil done.

**Sarf (Morphology):** شَرّ is from the geminate root ش-ر-ر on the فَعْل pattern — the double final radical merges (شَرَر → شَرّ). It is the exact semantic opposite of خَيْر (good), and both follow the same فَعْل morphological pattern, making them a natural pair. All other words are morphologically identical to verse 7.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah closes with a sobering symmetry. By ending on شَرًّا (evil) rather than خَيْرًا (good), the final word the listener hears is a warning — the surah's last impression is accountability for wrongdoing. The two-verse couplet functions as a complete ethical system in fourteen words: every action, no matter how small, has consequences. The fact that this is among the most memorized passages in the Quran testifies to the power of grammatical parallelism as a rhetorical device — identical structures with one word changed communicate more effectively than any elaboration could.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="The conditional sentence beginning with إِذَا in verse 1 does not receive its answer (جَوَاب الشَّرْط) until verse 4. Identify the protasis (condition) and apodosis (answer), and explain why the three-verse delay creates rhetorical impact. What is the grammatical role of verses 2 and 3 within this structure?">

**The conditional structure:**
- **Protasis (condition):** إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا (verse 1) — "When the earth is shaken with its earthquake"
- **Apodosis (answer):** يَوْمَئِذٍ تُحَدِّثُ أَخْبَارَهَا (verse 4) — "That Day, it will report its news"

**Verses 2-3 within the structure:**
- Verse 2 (وَأَخْرَجَتِ الْأَرْضُ أَثْقَالَهَا) is coordinated with the condition by وَ — an additional clause within the protasis, expanding the scenario
- Verse 3 (وَقَالَ الْإِنسَانُ مَا لَهَا) is also coordinated with the protasis — another event within the "when" timeframe

**Rhetorical impact of delay:**
The three-verse gap between condition and answer creates dramatic tension (تَشْوِيق). The listener's mind is held in suspense: the earth shakes, it expels its contents, humanity panics — and the listener keeps waiting for the resolution. When the answer finally arrives in verse 4, it delivers not the expected physical consequence but something unexpected: the earth *speaks*. The delay ensures that the listener processes the full magnitude of the event before learning its purpose.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the passive verb in verse 1 (زُلْزِلَتِ) with the active verb in verse 2 (أَخْرَجَتِ). Explain the voice shift, identify each verb's form and root, and describe what role الْأَرْض plays in each verse grammatically. Why does this shift matter rhetorically?">

**Verse 1: زُلْزِلَتِ (passive)**
- **Root:** ز-ل-ز-ل (quadriliteral)
- **Form:** Passive of quadriliteral (فُعْلِلَت pattern)
- **الْأَرْض role:** Deputy subject (نَائِب الفَاعِل) — nominative, but receiving the action

**Verse 2: أَخْرَجَتِ (active)**
- **Root:** خ-ر-ج (triliteral)
- **Form:** Form IV active (أَفْعَلَت pattern)
- **الْأَرْض role:** Subject (فَاعِل) — nominative, performing the action

**The voice shift matters because:**
In verse 1, the earth is passive — it is *acted upon* by an unnamed agent (Allah). This concealment of the agent conveys divine majesty: the earthquake is so powerful that its cause is left unstated. In verse 2, the earth becomes active — it *brings forth* its own contents. The grammatical shift mirrors a physical reality: first the external force (earthquake) strikes the earth, then the earth responds with its own action (ejecting burdens). The earth transitions from patient to agent, from silent recipient to active participant in the divine plan.

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ construction in verses 7-8. Identify the iḍāfa relationship, explain the tamyīz (خَيْرًا/شَرًّا), and show how مَنْ creates the jussive mood in both the condition and answer verbs. Provide the full i'rāb of verse 7.">

**The iḍāfa (مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ):**
- مِثْقَالَ is the muḍāf (first term) — accusative because it is the maf'ūl bihi (direct object) of يَعْمَلْ
- ذَرَّةٍ is the muḍāf ilayh (second term) — genitive (majrūr) by the iḍāfa relationship
- Together: "the weight of an atom" — a measurement construction

**The tamyīz (خَيْرًا / شَرًّا):**
- تَمْيِيز is a specification noun that clarifies an ambiguous element
- مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ specifies *how much* but not *of what*
- خَيْرًا / شَرًّا answers "of what kind?" — "of good" / "of evil"
- Always indefinite and accusative

**Jussive from مَنْ:**
- مَنْ is a conditional particle (أَدَاة شَرْط جَازِمَة) that puts both verbs in the jussive (مَجْزُوم)
- يَعْمَلْ — jussive marked by sukūn on the final لْ (indicative would be يَعْمَلُ)
- يَرَهُ — jussive marked by deletion of the alif (يَرَى → يَرَ); the defective verb loses its final weak letter

**Full i'rāb of verse 7:**
- فَ — resultative conjunction (حَرْف عَطْف), mabni
- مَنْ — conditional pronoun (اسم شرط), mabni, in the place of rafa' (subject)
- يَعْمَلْ — present jussive (فعل مضارع مجزوم), condition verb, sign: sukūn
- مِثْقَالَ — maf'ūl bihi, manṣūb, sign: fatḥa, muḍāf
- ذَرَّةٍ — muḍāf ilayh, majrūr, sign: kasra
- خَيْرًا — tamyīz, manṣūb, sign: fatḥa with tanwīn
- يَرَ — present jussive (jawāb al-sharṭ), majzūm, sign: deletion of weak letter (حذف حرف العلة)
- ـهُ — attached pronoun, maf'ūl bihi, in the place of naṣb

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **إِذَا temporal conditional**: Introduces a certain future event ("when," not "if") — the protasis spans verses 1-3 with a delayed answer in verse 4
- **Quadriliteral root**: ز-ل-ز-ل is a four-letter root formed by reduplication of ز-ل, encoding repeated/intensive action
- **مَفْعُول مُطْلَق (cognate accusative)**: زِلْزَالَهَا — a noun from the same root as the verb, in the accusative, intensifying the action
- **Passive ↔ active voice shift**: زُلْزِلَتِ (passive, v.1) → أَخْرَجَتِ (active, v.2) — earth transitions from patient to agent
- **نَائِب الفَاعِل (deputy subject)**: In passive constructions, the original object becomes the subject — الْأَرْضُ after زُلْزِلَتِ
- **يَوْمَئِذٍ compound adverb**: يَوْم + إِذْ + tanwīn عِوَض (compensatory) — "on that day when..."
- **Form II intensive**: تُحَدِّثُ from حَدَّثَ — doubled middle radical adds intensity/detail to the base meaning
- **بِأَنَّ causal clause**: بِ (because) + أَنَّ (that indeed) + ism + khabar — explains the reason for the earth's testimony
- **حَال (state) construction**: أَشْتَاتًا — accusative noun describing the state of the subject during the action
- **لِ + subjunctive (purpose clause)**: لِيُرَوْا — lām of purpose with implied أَنْ governing the subjunctive mood
- **مَنْ conditional with jussive**: Governs both condition verb (يَعْمَلْ) and answer verb (يَرَهُ) in the jussive mood
- **مِثْقَالَ ذَرَّةٍ iḍāfa**: Measurement construction — the muḍāf specifies quantity, the muḍāf ilayh specifies the unit
- **تَمْيِيز (specification)**: خَيْرًا / شَرًّا — indefinite accusative nouns clarifying the type of deed measured
- **Perfect parallelism**: Verses 7-8 are structurally identical, differing only in the tamyīz — encoding equal divine treatment of good and evil
