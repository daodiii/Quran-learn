### Structural Overview

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ | Imperative + verbal | Imperative + present tense + بِ + idafah | I seek refuge in the Lord of Daybreak |
| 2 | مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ | Prepositional | مِن شَرِّ + relative clause with مَا | From the evil of what He created |
| 3 | وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ | Prepositional + conditional | Active participle + إِذَا temporal clause | From the evil of darkness when it settles |
| 4 | وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ | Prepositional | Intensive active participle (فَعَّالات) | From the evil of those who blow on knots |
| 5 | وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ | Prepositional + conditional | Active participle + إِذَا + cognate verb | From the evil of an envier when he envies |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Surah Matters for Grammar">
Al-Falaq is built on a single grammatical framework: أَعُوذُ بِـ...مِن شَرِّ ("I seek refuge in...from the evil of..."). This framework is then filled with four different grammatical structures to describe four types of evil: a relative clause (مَا خَلَقَ), an active participle with conditional (غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ), an intensive active participle (النَّفَّاثَاتِ), and another active participle with conditional (حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ). The repeated مِن شَرِّ creates a powerful anaphoric pattern, while the variation in what follows teaches multiple grammatical structures within one framework.

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ | qul | ق و ل | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person masculine singular | Command verb (fi'l amr) - mabni | Say |
| 2 | أَعُوذُ | a'ūdhu | ع و ذ | Verb - Form I, present tense, 1st person singular | Present tense verb (fi'l mudari') - indicative (marfu') | I seek refuge, I take refuge |
| 3 | بِرَبِّ | bi-rabbi | ر ب ب | Preposition + noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Preposition + noun (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | In the Lord, with the Lord |
| 4 | الْفَلَقِ | al-falaqi | ف ل ق | Noun - masculine singular, definite | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | The daybreak, the dawn |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The أَعُوذُ بِـ Construction">
أَعُوذُ (I seek refuge) always takes the preposition بِـ to indicate the one in whom refuge is sought: أَعُوذُ بِاللهِ ("I seek refuge in Allah"). The بِ here is called ba' al-isti'anah (the ba' of seeking help). This is followed by مِن to indicate what is being sought refuge FROM. This two-part framework (بِـ for the protector, مِن for the threat) structures the entire surah.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** قُلْ is an imperative (fi'l amr) with implied subject أَنتَ. أَعُوذُ is a present tense verb indicating continuous/habitual action — seeking refuge is not a one-time event. بِرَبِّ الْفَلَقِ is a prepositional phrase containing an idafah: رَبّ (mudaf) + الْفَلَق (mudaf ilayhi). The بِ governs رَبِّ into the genitive, and الْفَلَقِ is genitive because it's the mudaf ilayhi.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَعُوذُ from root ع-و-ذ is a hollow verb (weak middle radical و). The present tense retains the و as a long vowel ū. الْفَلَق from root ف-ل-ق on pattern فَعَل literally means "the splitting/cleaving" — referring to dawn when darkness splits open to reveal light.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Allah is described not just as رَبّ (Lord) but as رَبِّ الْفَلَقِ — the Lord who splits darkness with light. This specific divine attribute is chosen because the surah addresses fears associated with darkness and hidden evils. The one who breaks apart darkness is the perfect protector against all dark forces. The present tense أَعُوذُ makes this an ongoing, living supplication.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ"
  transliteration="min sharri mā khalaqa"
  translation="From the evil of what He created"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:2"
  highlight="مِن,شَرِّ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | مِن | min | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition (harf jarr) - mabni | From |
| 2 | شَرِّ | sharri | ش ر ر | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Object of preposition (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | Evil, harm |
| 3 | مَا | ma | - | Pronoun - relative | Relative pronoun (mawsul) - mabni, mudaf ilayhi in genitive position | What, that which |
| 4 | خَلَقَ | khalaqa | خ ل ق | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni, verb of the relative clause (silat al-mawsul) | He created |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="The General Before the Specific">
Verse 2 seeks refuge from evil in ALL creation (مَا خَلَقَ = "what He created"). Verses 3-5 then specify particular evils: darkness, sorcery, envy. This is a common Quranic pattern: state the general principle first, then enumerate specific instances. Grammatically, مَا خَلَقَ is the broadest possible relative clause — everything in existence — which is then narrowed by the following verses.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** مِن connects to أَعُوذُ in verse 1, specifying what refuge is sought from. شَرِّ مَا forms an idafah: شَرّ (mudaf) + مَا (mudaf ilayhi, in the position of genitive). مَا is a relative pronoun whose silah (relative clause) is خَلَقَ with a hidden subject (هُوَ, Allah) and a hidden return pronoun (عائد).

**Sarf (Morphology):** شَرّ from root ش-ر-ر on pattern فَعْل is a doubled root noun meaning "evil." خَلَقَ from root خ-ل-ق, Form I, is one of the most common Quranic verbs, always used for Allah's creative act. مَا here is ism mawsul (relative pronoun), not مَا al-nafiyah (negation) — context determines which function مَا serves.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Attributing creation to Allah (خَلَقَ) while seeking refuge from its evil creates a profound theological statement: Allah created everything, including the capacity for evil, yet He is the refuge from that evil. The indefiniteness implied by مَا (open-ended "whatever") makes this the most comprehensive possible plea for protection.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ"
  transliteration="wa-min sharri ghāsiqin idhā waqaba"
  translation="And from the evil of darkness when it settles"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:3"
  highlight="غَاسِقٍ,إِذَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَمِن | wa-min | - | Conjunction + preposition | Coordinating conjunction + preposition (harf jarr) - mabni | And from |
| 2 | شَرِّ | sharri | ش ر ر | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Object of preposition (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | Evil, harm |
| 3 | غَاسِقٍ | ghāsiqin | غ س ق | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, active participle | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | Darkness, dark night |
| 4 | إِذَا | idhā | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Conditional particle (dharf li-l-mustaqbal) - mabni | When |
| 5 | وَقَبَ | waqaba | و ق ب | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni, verb of the condition (fi'l al-shart) | It settled, it penetrated, it deepened |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Active Participle (Ism al-Fa'il) as a Noun">
غَاسِقٍ is an active participle (pattern فَاعِل) from root غ-س-ق. Active participles can function as **adjectives** ("darkening") or as **nouns** ("that which darkens" = darkness/night). Here it functions as a noun — the mudaf ilayhi in the idafah شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ ("the evil of a darkening [thing]"). Its indefiniteness (with tanwin) suggests any darkness, not a specific one.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَمِن is coordinated with the مِن in verse 2, adding a second category of evil. شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ is an idafah. إِذَا وَقَبَ is an adverbial (temporal) clause modifying غَاسِقٍ: "darkness WHEN it settles." إِذَا takes a past tense verb (وَقَبَ) but refers to a conditional/future meaning: "whenever it settles."

**Sarf (Morphology):** غَاسِق on pattern فَاعِل from root غ-س-ق is a rare word — it appears only in this surah and Surah al-Isra' (17:78). وَقَبَ from root و-ق-ب means "to enter deeply, to penetrate" — when night settles, it doesn't merely arrive, it penetrates and envelops everything.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The evil is not in darkness itself, but in darkness "when it settles" (إِذَا وَقَبَ) — at its deepest, most complete moment. The إِذَا clause restricts the meaning temporally: protection is sought specifically at the peak of darkness, when evil is at its strongest. The rare, evocative vocabulary (غَاسِق, وَقَبَ) creates an atmosphere of dread that matches the content.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ"
  transliteration="wa-min sharri n-naffāthāti fī l-'uqad"
  translation="And from the evil of those who blow on knots"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:4"
  highlight="النَّفَّاثَاتِ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَمِن | wa-min | - | Conjunction + preposition | Coordinating conjunction + preposition (harf jarr) - mabni | And from |
| 2 | شَرِّ | sharri | ش ر ر | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Object of preposition (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | Evil, harm |
| 3 | النَّفَّاثَاتِ | al-naffāthāti | ن ف ث | Noun - feminine plural, definite, intensive active participle | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | Those who blow (habitual blowers) |
| 4 | فِي | fī | - | Particle - preposition | Preposition (harf jarr) - mabni | In, on, into |
| 5 | الْعُقَدِ | al-'uqadi | ع ق د | Noun - feminine plural, definite | Object of preposition (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | The knots |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Intensive Active Participle: Pattern نَفَّاعات (فَعَّالات)">
النَّفَّاثَاتِ follows the pattern فَعَّالات — the **intensive active participle** in the feminine plural. Compare three levels of intensity from root ن-ف-ث:
- **نَافِثَة** (فَاعِلَة) — "one who blows" (simple active participle)
- **نَفَّاثَة** (فَعَّالَة) — "one who blows repeatedly/habitually" (intensive)
- **نَفَّاثَات** (فَعَّالَات) — the plural of the intensive form

The intensive pattern was also seen in حَمَّالَة (Al-Masad 111:4). The فَعَّال pattern indicates habitual, professional-level action — these are practitioners of sorcery, not people who blow incidentally.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Third مِن شَرِّ phrase, coordinated with the previous two. النَّفَّاثَاتِ is the mudaf ilayhi — its genitive case is shown by the kasra (sound feminine plural takes kasra in all three oblique cases: genitive AND accusative). فِي الْعُقَدِ is an adverbial phrase specifying where the blowing occurs. الْعُقَد is the broken plural of عُقْدَة (knot).

**Sarf (Morphology):** النَّفَّاثَات from root ن-ف-ث on pattern فَعَّالات. The root means "to blow lightly" (less forceful than نَفَخَ). The feminine plural ـَات could refer specifically to women or more broadly to "souls/selves" (أَنْفُس, which is grammatically feminine). الْعُقَد from root ع-ق-د on the broken plural pattern فُعَل — the singular عُقْدَة means a knot or tie.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse refers to the practice of sorcery: practitioners would tie knots in a cord while blowing incantations on each one. The definite article الـ on both النَّفَّاثَات and الْعُقَد makes them specific and known — "THE blowers on THE knots" — suggesting this was a recognized practice. The intensive form conveys that these aren't casual practitioners but dedicated, habitual sorcerers whose evil is severe enough to warrant divine protection.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ"
  transliteration="wa-min sharri hāsidin idhā hasada"
  translation="And from the evil of an envier when he envies"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:5"
  highlight="حَاسِدٍ,حَسَدَ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَمِن | wa-min | - | Conjunction + preposition | Coordinating conjunction + preposition (harf jarr) - mabni | And from |
| 2 | شَرِّ | sharri | ش ر ر | Noun - masculine singular, construct state (mudaf) | Object of preposition (majrur bi-l-harf) - genitive (majrur) | Evil, harm |
| 3 | حَاسِدٍ | hāsidin | ح س د | Noun - masculine singular, indefinite, active participle | Second part of construct (mudaf ilayhi) - genitive (majrur) | An envier, one who envies |
| 4 | إِذَا | idhā | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Conditional particle (dharf li-l-mustaqbal) - mabni | When |
| 5 | حَسَدَ | hasada | ح س د | Verb - Form I, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Past tense verb (fi'l madi) - mabni, verb of the condition (fi'l al-shart) | He envied |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Cognate Verb and Noun from the Same Root">
حَاسِدٍ (envier) and حَسَدَ (he envied) share the same root ح-س-د. When an active participle and its cognate verb appear together, it creates a powerful emphasis: the envier is defined by envy (active participle = identity), and the temporal clause specifies when envy becomes dangerous (verb = action). The evil isn't in the person's existence, but in the moment they ACT on their envy. Grammar distinguishes between the disposition and the deed.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Fourth and final مِن شَرِّ phrase. The structure exactly parallels verse 3: شَرِّ + active participle (حَاسِدٍ) + إِذَا + past tense verb (حَسَدَ). This parallel structure creates a grammatical bookend: v3 and v5 frame v4 with identical syntax (participle + إِذَا clause), while v4 stands alone with its unique intensive form.

**Sarf (Morphology):** حَاسِد on pattern فَاعِل from root ح-س-د is a standard active participle. حَسَدَ on pattern فَعَلَ is the Form I past tense from the same root. The morphological connection between the two forms is transparent: فَاعِل (the doer of the action) + فَعَلَ (the action itself).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The إِذَا clause is theologically precise: protection is sought not from the person who has envy in their heart (a private emotion), but from the envier "when he envies" — when that internal feeling manifests as active harm. The indefiniteness of حَاسِدٍ (with tanwin, no الـ) means "any envier" — the threat is universal and anonymous. The surah's progression from cosmic evil (what He created), to natural evil (darkness), to human evil (sorcery, envy) narrows from the broadest to the most personal threats.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="The phrase مِن شَرِّ appears four times in this surah (v2-5). In each case, identify what follows شَرِّ as the mudaf ilayhi and classify its grammatical form (relative clause, active participle, intensive participle, etc.).">

| Verse | مِن شَرِّ + ... | Grammatical Form | Analysis |
|-------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| v2 | مَا خَلَقَ | **Relative clause** (مَا + verb) | The broadest category — evil in ALL creation |
| v3 | غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ | **Active participle** (فَاعِل) + temporal clause | Natural evil — darkness at its peak |
| v4 | النَّفَّاثَاتِ فِي الْعُقَدِ | **Intensive active participle** (فَعَّالَات) + prepositional phrase | Human evil (deliberate) — habitual sorcerers |
| v5 | حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ | **Active participle** (فَاعِل) + temporal clause | Human evil (emotional) — envier when acting on envy |

**Pattern:** The surah moves from the most general (everything created) to the most specific (a single person's envy), grammatically reflected in the shift from an open-ended relative pronoun (مَا) to a single indefinite noun (حَاسِدٍ). The threats become increasingly personal and intimate as the surah progresses.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Compare غَاسِقٍ (v3, indefinite) with النَّفَّاثَاتِ (v4, definite). Why does the Quran make one indefinite and the other definite? What grammatical and rhetorical difference does this create?">

**غَاسِقٍ — Indefinite (with tanwin):**
- Grammatically: indefinite noun as mudaf ilayhi
- Meaning: "ANY darkness" — not a specific night, but any time darkness settles
- Rhetorical effect: universality — protection covers all instances of darkness
- Parallel: حَاسِدٍ (v5) is also indefinite — "any envier"

**النَّفَّاثَاتِ — Definite (with الـ):**
- Grammatically: definite noun as mudaf ilayhi
- Meaning: "THE blowers on knots" — a specific, known group/practice
- Rhetorical effect: specificity — refers to known practitioners of a recognized art
- The الـ is for عَهْد (prior knowledge) — the audience knows exactly who this refers to

**Why the difference?** Darkness and envy are universal, unpredictable threats (hence indefinite — they could come from anywhere). Sorcery is a specific, identifiable practice performed by known practitioners (hence definite — they can be pointed to). The grammar maps onto the nature of each threat: indefinite for the unknowable, definite for the identifiable.
