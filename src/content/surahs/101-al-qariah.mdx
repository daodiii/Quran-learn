</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="A Surah Built on Active Participles">
Al-Qari'ah is remarkable for its density of active participles (ism fa'il): ٱلْقَارِعَة (the Striker), رَاضِيَة (the pleasant/satisfying), هَاوِيَة (the falling/Abyss), and حَامِيَة (the scorching). Each of these participles on the فَاعِلَة pattern carries the feminine ta marbuta, creating a haunting phonetic unity across the surah. The progression is striking: the surah opens with al-Qari'ah (calamity), branches into radiyah (bliss) for the righteous and hawiyah (ruin) for the wicked, and closes with hamiyah (scorching heat). The grammar maps the entire narrative arc from event to outcome.

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | ٱلْقَارِعَةُ | al-qāri'atu | ق ر ع | Active participle - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') without khabar (for emphasis) - nominative (marfu') | The Striking Calamity |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Mubtada Without Khabar: Dramatic Incompletion">
Al-qāri'ah stands alone as a mubtada (subject) with no khabar (predicate). Normally, Arabic nominal sentences require both. By omitting the khabar, the Quran forces the listener to pause — what about the Striking Calamity? This deliberate incompletion creates suspense and elevates the subject to something so immense it needs no description. The one-word sentence is the grammatical equivalent of a dramatic announcement.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="The Root ق-ر-ع: To Strike, To Knock">
ٱلْقَارِعَةُ is an active participle (ism fa'il) from the root ق-ر-ع meaning "to strike" or "to knock." On the فَاعِلَة pattern, it denotes "the one that strikes" — personifying the Day of Judgment as a force that knocks violently on the door of existence. The definite article الـ marks it as a known, specific event, while the feminine form suggests it is a name/title for that Day.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence consisting only of a mubtada (subject) in the nominative case (marfu') with damma. The khabar (predicate) is intentionally omitted (mahdhuf) for rhetorical effect. The alif-lam (الـ) on ٱلْقَارِعَةُ is al-'ahd (for known reference), indicating a specific, already-anticipated event.

**Sarf (Morphology):** ٱلْقَارِعَةُ derives from root ق-ر-ع on the فَاعِلَة pattern — the feminine active participle of قَرَعَ (to strike, knock). The ta marbuta (ة) marks feminine gender. The hamza (ء) appears as part of the root's third radical (ع) — the word is fully regular.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening a surah with a single word — a name with no predicate — is extraordinarily powerful. It functions like a thunderclap: ٱلْقَارِعَةُ! The listener hears the name of the Day of Judgment and is left suspended, waiting. The absence of khabar implies that no predicate could adequately describe it. This opening mirrors the style of Surah 69 (ٱلْحَاقَّةُ) and Surah 56 (ٱلْوَاقِعَةُ), where eschatological events are introduced as standalone pronouncements.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ"
  transliteration="mā al-qāri'atu"
  translation="What is the Striking Calamity?"
  reference="Al-Qari'ah 101:2"
  highlight="مَا"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | مَا | mā | - | Particle - interrogative | Not declinable (mabni), question particle | What? |
| 2 | ٱلْقَارِعَةُ | al-qāri'atu | ق ر ع | Active participle - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the Striking Calamity |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Interrogative مَا for Rhetorical Magnification">
مَا here is an interrogative pronoun (ism istifham) used not to seek information but to magnify the subject. The question "What is the Striking Calamity?" does not expect an answer from the listener — it is rhetorical, designed to convey that the event is so overwhelming it defies easy description. In i'rab terms, مَا functions as the khabar (predicate) placed first, and ٱلْقَارِعَةُ is the mubtada' (subject), creating an inverted nominal sentence typical of interrogative constructions.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is a nominal sentence with مَا as an interrogative pronoun functioning as the khabar (placed first, as is typical when the khabar is an interrogative). ٱلْقَارِعَةُ is the mubtada' in the nominative case. The sentence structure is khabar + mubtada' (inverted order, wajib al-taqdim because the khabar is an interrogative word).

**Sarf (Morphology):** مَا is an indeclinable (mabni) particle. ٱلْقَارِعَةُ retains its nominative form from verse 1 — same root, same pattern, same morphological analysis.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Repeating ٱلْقَارِعَةُ immediately after verse 1 creates ta'zim (magnification). The question form transforms the bare announcement of verse 1 into an inquiry that challenges human comprehension. The listener who just heard the name now hears it questioned — as if the name alone is insufficient, demanding explanation. This two-verse buildup (statement then question) is a Quranic pattern that draws the listener deeper into contemplation before the full revelation.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ"
  transliteration="wa-mā adrāka mā al-qāri'atu"
  translation="And what can make you know what the Striking Calamity is?"

| 2 | مَآ | mā | - | Particle - interrogative | Not declinable (mabni), question particle | What? |
| 3 | أَدْرَىٰكَ | adrāka | د ر ي | Verb - Form IV, past tense, 3rd person masculine singular + attached pronoun | Verb - mabni 'ala fatha maqdurah, ka = direct object | made you know |
| 4 | مَا | mā | - | Particle - interrogative | Not declinable (mabni), introduces second object clause | what |
| 5 | ٱلْقَارِعَةُ | al-qāri'atu | ق ر ع | Active participle - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the Striking Calamity |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ Formula: Beyond Comprehension">
وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ مَا is a recurring Quranic formula (also in 104:5, 82:17-18, 83:8, 90:12) used to introduce something beyond human comprehension. It contains two interrogative مَا pronouns: the first asks "what could possibly inform you?" and the second asks "what is X?" The formula always signals that the answer will be extraordinary. أَدْرَاكَ is Form IV from root د-ر-ي: دَرَى = "he knew/perceived" leads to أَدْرَى = "he caused to know/made aware."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse contains two clauses. The first: مَا (interrogative, mubtada) + أَدْرَاكَ (verbal sentence as khabar). The second: مَا (interrogative, khabar) + ٱلْقَارِعَةُ (mubtada, nominative). The second مَا clause functions as the maf'ul bihi (direct object) of أَدْرَاكَ — "what made you know [what the Striking Calamity is]." The ـكَ suffix on أَدْرَاكَ addresses the Prophet Muhammad directly.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَدْرَاكَ follows the Form IV pattern أَفْعَلَ from root د-ر-ي (a defective root with ya as the third radical). The alif in أَدْرَى represents the weakened third radical. When the attached pronoun كَ is added, the alif becomes visible as alif maqsurah: أَدْرَىٰكَ. The كَ is the second person masculine singular attached object pronoun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This is the third mention of ٱلْقَارِعَةُ in three consecutive verses — a rhetorical tripling (tikrar) that drills the name into the listener's consciousness. The wa-mā adrāka formula escalates beyond the simple question of verse 2: it declares that not only is al-Qāri'ah beyond description, it is beyond the Prophet's own comprehension without divine revelation. This creates a three-step crescendo: announcement (v1) followed by question (v2) followed by incomprehensibility (v3), before the description finally begins in verse 4.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَ يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ"
  transliteration="yawma yakūnu an-nāsu ka-l-farāshi al-mabthūthi"
  translation="The Day when people will be like scattered moths"
  reference="Al-Qari'ah 101:4"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Simile Construction with كَ: The Comparison Particle">
كَ is a preposition of comparison (harf tashbih) that introduces the second element of a simile. The structure is: مُشَبَّه (thing compared) + كَ + مُشَبَّه بِه (thing compared to). Here ٱلنَّاسُ is the mushabbah (people) and ٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ is the mushabbah bihi (scattered moths). The كَ governs the genitive case on everything after it. In kana sentences, the simile with كَ typically occupies the khabar position.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Al-Mabthuth: Passive Participle from a Doubled Root">
ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ is a passive participle (ism maf'ul) from بَثَّ (root ب-ث-ث, a doubled/geminate root meaning "to scatter, spread"). The فَعَل pattern with identical second and third radicals produces a doubled consonant: بَثَّ. The passive participle مَبْثُوث follows the standard مَفْعُول pattern. The image of moths scattered erratically around a light captures the confusion and purposelessness of humanity on that Day.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَوْمَ is an adverb of time (zarf zaman) in the accusative, or alternatively a badal (appositive) to ٱلْقَارِعَةُ. It is also a mudaf, with the clause يَكُونُ... functioning as its mudaf ilayh. يَكُونُ ٱلنَّاسُ is a kana sentence: يَكُونُ is the verb (indicative, marfu'), ٱلنَّاسُ is the ism of kana (nominative), and the prepositional phrase كَٱلْفَرَاشِ ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ is the khabar of kana (in the genitive because of كَ).

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَكُونُ is a hollow verb (ajwaf) from root ك-و-ن — the waw appears in the past tense (كَانَ) but is preserved in the present. ٱلْفَرَاش follows the فَعَال pattern, a collective noun for moths/butterflies. ٱلْمَبْثُوث from root ب-ث-ث follows the مَفْعُول passive participle pattern; the doubled root causes the two tha's to merge.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The simile of people as scattered moths is devastatingly precise. Moths (فَرَاش) are drawn helplessly to light, fluttering without direction or purpose — exactly the state of humanity on that Day. The passive participle ٱلْمَبْثُوثِ (scattered) emphasizes that people are not choosing to scatter; they are being scattered by forces beyond their control. The transition from the three-verse buildup (vv. 1-3) to this vivid image finally begins to answer the question "What is al-Qari'ah?" — it is a day so terrifying that billions of humans become as insignificant as moths.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَتَكُونُ ٱلْجِبَالُ كَٱلْعِهْنِ ٱلْمَنفُوشِ"
  transliteration="wa-takūnu al-jibālu ka-l-'ihni al-manfūshi"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Parallel Structure: يَكُونُ / تَكُونُ">
Verses 4 and 5 form a grammatically parallel pair. Verse 4: يَكُونُ (masculine, for ٱلنَّاسُ) + simile. Verse 5: تَكُونُ (feminine, for ٱلْجِبَالُ) + simile. The verb changes gender to agree with its subject, but the sentence structure is identical: kana verb + ism kana + كَ + mushabbah bihi. This parallelism contrasts two extremes: the animate (people) and the inanimate (mountains) are both utterly transformed.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse mirrors verse 4 exactly in structure. تَكُونُ takes the feminine prefix تَ to agree with ٱلْجِبَالُ (feminine plural). ٱلْجِبَالُ is the ism of kana (nominative). The prepositional phrase كَٱلْعِهْنِ ٱلْمَنفُوشِ is the khabar of kana. ٱلْمَنفُوشِ is an adjective (na't) modifying ٱلْعِهْنِ, matching in case (genitive), gender (masculine), number (singular), and definiteness (definite).

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَكُونُ is the same hollow verb as يَكُونُ but with the feminine prefix تَ. ٱلْجِبَالُ is the broken plural of جَبَل on the فِعَال pattern. ٱلْعِهْنِ (wool) is from root ع-ه-ن on the فِعْل pattern. ٱلْمَنفُوشِ is a passive participle (مَفْعُول) from نَفَشَ (to card, fluff, tease out wool), root ن-ف-ش.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The progression from people to mountains escalates the imagery. If people — who are fragile — become like scattered moths, then mountains — the symbols of permanence and solidity — becoming like fluffed wool demonstrates absolute cosmic dissolution. The word ٱلْمَنفُوش (carded) specifically describes wool that has been pulled apart into loose, colorful fibers that float in the air. Mountains reduced to floating fibers is an image of utter obliteration. The two similes together (vv. 4-5) create a comprehensive picture: nothing survives al-Qari'ah intact.

### Verse 6

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The فَأَمَّا... فَـ Construction: Conditional Categorization">
فَأَمَّا introduces a conditional categorization — it separates people into groups and assigns each group a consequence. The structure requires a فَـ (fa) before the jawab (answer/consequence), which comes in verse 7. أَمَّا literally means "whatever the case may be regarding..." and مَن (relative pronoun) specifies "whoever." This construction is common in the Quran for delineating fates on the Day of Judgment (see also 69:19-25, 79:37-41).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is a conjunction introducing the result after the cosmic description of verses 4-5. أَمَّا is a conditional particle (harf shart wa-tafsil) that governs the structure: the topic (مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُ) comes between أَمَّا and the jawab (answer) introduced by فَ in verse 7. مَن is a relative pronoun functioning as the mubtada. ثَقُلَتْ is the verb of the relative clause, and مَوَٰزِينُهُ is its fa'il (subject, nominative).

**Sarf (Morphology):** ثَقُلَتْ is a Form I past tense verb from root ث-ق-ل on the فَعُلَ pattern (intransitive: "to be/become heavy"). The ta marbuta (تْ) at the end marks feminine gender to agree with مَوَازِين. مَوَٰزِين is the broken plural of مِيزَان (scale/balance) on the مَفَاعِيل pattern. The root و-ز-ن gives مِيزَان on the مِفْعَال pattern (with the waw becoming ya due to the mi- prefix).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The transition from cosmic imagery (vv. 4-5) to individual judgment (vv. 6-7) is dramatic. After showing the universe dissolving, the surah suddenly focuses on one person and their scales. فَأَمَّا creates anticipation — the listener knows a contrast is coming (confirmed in verse 8). The word مَوَٰزِين (scales, plural) may indicate multiple scales for different types of deeds, adding weight to the judgment imagery.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَهُوَ فِى عِيشَةٍۢ رَّاضِيَةٍۢ"
  transliteration="fa-huwa fī 'īshatin rādiyatin"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Radiyah: Active Participle with Passive Meaning">
رَاضِيَة is an active participle (ism fa'il) from root ر-ض-و on the فَاعِلَة pattern. Grammatically, it should mean "one that is pleased/satisfied" (the life itself being pleased). However, it is used with a passive/transitive sense: "a life that is pleasing/satisfying" (causing pleasure to the one living it). This is a known phenomenon in Arabic grammar where certain active participles carry passive meaning. Some scholars explain عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ as "a life of contentment" — the life itself is characterized by rida (satisfaction).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ introduces the jawab (answer) to the أَمَّا condition of verse 6. The sentence is nominal: هُوَ is the mubtada' (subject, indeclinable pronoun), and the prepositional phrase فِي عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ is the khabar (predicate). عِيشَةٍ is majrur (genitive) due to the preposition فِي. رَاضِيَةٍ is a na't (adjective) of عِيشَةٍ, matching it in case (genitive), gender (feminine), number (singular), and indefiniteness (tanwin).

**Sarf (Morphology):** عِيشَةٍ is a verbal noun (masdar) from root ع-ي-ش on the فِعْلَة pattern, indicating a manner or type of living. رَاضِيَةٍ is the feminine active participle from root ر-ض-و (a defective root with waw as the third radical). The base form is رَاضٍ (masculine), with the ya appearing in the feminine form رَاضِيَة.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The brevity of this verse — just five words describing Paradise — contrasts powerfully with the elaborate descriptions of cosmic destruction in verses 1-5. The understated simplicity implies that Paradise needs no elaboration: عِيشَة رَاضِيَة (a satisfying life) says everything. The indefinite tanwin on both words (عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ) suggests boundlessness — not just "a" pleasant life but a life whose pleasantness is beyond definition or limitation.

<Callout type="rule" title="Doubled Root: خَفَّتْ from خ-ف-ف">
خَفَّتْ is from root خ-ف-ف, a doubled (geminate) root where the second and third radicals are identical. In the past tense, the two identical letters merge with a shadda: خَفَّ. The ta marbuta (تْ) marks feminine gender agreement with مَوَازِين. This verb is the antonym of ثَقُلَتْ from verse 6, creating a precise lexical contrast within an identical syntactic frame.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse exactly mirrors verse 6 in structure: وَأَمَّا (with و for conjunction) + مَنْ (relative pronoun, mubtada) + verbal relative clause (خَفَّتْ مَوَٰزِينُهُ). The parallel construction creates a binary classification: heavy scales (v6) vs. light scales (v8). The jawab (answer) for this second أَمَّا comes in verse 9.

**Sarf (Morphology):** خَفَّتْ is a Form I verb from the geminate root خ-ف-ف on the فَعَّ pattern (with identical second and third radicals merging). The intransitive meaning "to be/become light" matches the intransitive ثَقُلَتْ "to be/become heavy." مَوَٰزِينُهُ is morphologically identical to its occurrence in verse 6.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The perfect parallelism between verses 6 and 8 is deliberate and devastating. By using the same structure with only one word changed (ثَقُلَتْ to خَفَّتْ), the Quran emphasizes that the difference between Paradise and Hell hinges on a single variable: the weight of one's deeds. The simplicity of the contrast — heavy vs. light — makes the message universally accessible while the identical grammar underscores the equal certainty of both outcomes.

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأُمُّهُۥ هَاوِيَةٌۭ"
  transliteration="fa-ummuhu hāwiyatun"
  translation="Then his refuge will be the Abyss"
  reference="Al-Qari'ah 101:9"
  highlight="أُمُّهُۥ,هَاوِيَةٌۭ"
/>

| 3 | هَاوِيَةٌۭ | hāwiyatun | ه و ي | Active participle - feminine, singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfu') | the Abyss/falling place |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Metaphorical Use of أُمّ: Mother as Refuge">
أُمُّهُ literally means "his mother." In Arabic, أُمّ carries the connotation of origin, shelter, and refuge — the place one returns to for safety. The metaphor is layered: (1) a person who falls returns to the earth, their "mother" (origin); (2) a helpless person runs to their mother for comfort; (3) here, instead of a comforting mother, this person's "refuge" is the bottomless Abyss. The irony is devastating: the word that should evoke safety and warmth instead names the most terrifying destination.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Hawiyah: Active Participle as Proper Noun">
هَاوِيَة is an active participle from root ه-و-ي (to fall, plunge, collapse) on the فَاعِلَة pattern. It literally means "the one that falls" or "the bottomless." It functions simultaneously as a descriptive adjective (a place of falling) and as a proper noun (a name for a level of Hell). The tanwin on هَاوِيَةٌ indicates it is used here in its descriptive/indefinite sense, emphasizing the quality of endlessness.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ introduces the jawab to the second أَمَّا condition (verse 8). The sentence is nominal: أُمُّهُ is the mubtada' (nominative, definite through the possessive pronoun) and هَاوِيَةٌ is the khabar (nominative, indefinite with tanwin). The indefinite khabar for a definite mubtada is standard in Arabic nominal sentences.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أُمُّ is from root ء-م-م on the فُعْل pattern. The doubled final radical (م-م) merges into a shadda. When the possessive pronoun هُ is added, the idafa is formed: أُمُّهُ. هَاوِيَةٌ derives from root ه-و-ي (a defective root with ya as third radical). The active participle فَاعِلَة pattern yields هَاوِيَة (with the weak ya preserved before the ta marbuta).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This is the most rhetorically charged verse in the surah. The stark contrast with verse 7 is shocking: instead of عِيشَة رَاضِيَة (a pleasant life), the person's أُمّ (mother/refuge) is هَاوِيَة (the Abyss). The metaphor transforms the tender image of a mother into a symbol of horror. Furthermore, the four active participles on the فَاعِلَة pattern across the surah — ٱلْقَارِعَة (v1), رَاضِيَة (v7), هَاوِيَة (v9), حَامِيَة (v11) — create a phonetic thread that binds the surah's narrative: the Day strikes, the righteous find pleasant life, and the wicked find the Abyss of scorching fire.

### Verse 10

  arabic="وَمَآ أَدْرَىٰكَ مَا هِىَۡ"
  transliteration="wa-mā adrāka mā hiya"
  translation="And what can make you know what it is?"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Double وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ: Structural Symmetry">
This is the second occurrence of the وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ formula in this surah (the first was verse 3). In verse 3 it magnified ٱلْقَارِعَةُ (the event); here in verse 10 it magnifies هَاوِيَة (the punishment). The repetition creates a structural frame: the surah opens and nearly closes with the same formula, amplifying both the cause (the Day of Judgment) and the consequence (Hellfire) as equally beyond human comprehension.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Identical structure to verse 3: مَا (interrogative, mubtada) + أَدْرَاكَ (khabar, verbal sentence) + مَا هِيَ (object clause). The difference is the second clause: verse 3 has مَا ٱلْقَارِعَةُ (what is the Calamity?) while verse 10 has مَا هِيَ (what is it?). The pronoun هِيَ refers back to هَاوِيَة from verse 9.

**Sarf (Morphology):** All words are morphologically identical to their occurrences in verse 3. هِيَ is the detached (munfasil) third person feminine singular pronoun, indeclinable (mabni 'ala l-fath).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition of the formula creates a ring composition within the surah. The listener recognizes the pattern from verse 3 and anticipates a revelatory answer. By using the pronoun هِيَ instead of repeating هَاوِيَة, the verse creates a moment of suspense — "what is *it*?" — forcing the listener to recall the terrifying name from verse 9 before the answer arrives in verse 11. The structural parallelism (vv. 3-4 answered the question about al-Qari'ah with imagery; vv. 10-11 answer the question about Hawiyah with a direct statement) shows different Quranic answering techniques.

### Verse 11

<ArabicExample
  arabic="نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌۢ"
  transliteration="nārun hāmiyatun"
  translation="A scorching Fire"
  reference="Al-Qari'ah 101:11"
  highlight="حَامِيَةٌۢ"
/>

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Implied Mubtada: هِيَ نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ">
This verse functions as the answer to the question in verse 10. The mubtada is implied (مُقَدَّر): هِيَ (it is). نَارٌ is the khabar (predicate, nominative with tanwin damma). Omitting the mubtada creates immediacy — the answer strikes without preamble, mirroring the striking nature of al-Qari'ah itself. The tanwin (indefinite) on both نَارٌ and حَامِيَةٌ intensifies the description: not "the Fire" but "a Fire" — emphasizing its quality rather than its identity.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The implied sentence is هِيَ نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ. هِيَ is the implied mubtada (referring to هَاوِيَة). نَارٌ is the khabar (nominative with tanwin). حَامِيَةٌ is a na't (adjective) of نَارٌ, agreeing in case (nominative), gender (feminine), number (singular), and indefiniteness (tanwin).

**Sarf (Morphology):** نَارٌ is from root ن-و-ر (a hollow root with waw as the middle radical). The original form is *nawr, but the waw drops in this noun pattern. حَامِيَة is an active participle from root ح-م-ي (a defective root with ya as the third radical) on the فَاعِلَة pattern. The base verb حَمِيَ means "to be intensely hot, to glow with heat." The ya is preserved in the feminine form: حَامِيَة.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends with devastating simplicity. After eleven verses of buildup — naming, questioning, describing cosmic dissolution, dividing humanity, and naming the Abyss — the final answer is just two words: نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ (a scorching Fire). This brevity is itself a rhetorical device: after all the suspense, the answer needs no elaboration. The indefinite forms (tanwin on both words) suggest boundless, immeasurable heat. The final word حَامِيَة echoes the surah's opening ٱلْقَارِعَة in its فَاعِلَة pattern, creating phonetic closure: the surah that began with "the Striking" ends with "the Scorching."

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="This surah contains four active participles on the فَاعِلَة pattern: ٱلْقَارِعَة, رَاضِيَة, هَاوِيَة, and حَامِيَة. For each, identify the root, the base verb meaning, and explain how the active participle transforms the verb into a descriptive noun. Then explain the narrative role each plays in the surah's structure.">

**1. ٱلْقَارِعَة (al-qāri'ah)**
- **Root:** ق-ر-ع | **Base verb:** قَرَعَ = "to strike, knock"
- **Active participle meaning:** "The one that strikes" — transforms the action of striking into a personified entity, a name for the Day of Judgment
- **Narrative role:** Opens the surah (vv. 1-3), setting the scene

**2. رَاضِيَة (rādiyah)**
- **Root:** ر-ض-و | **Base verb:** رَضِيَ = "to be pleased, satisfied"
- **Active participle meaning:** "The one that is pleasing/satisfying" — transforms the state of satisfaction into a quality of life in Paradise
- **Narrative role:** Describes the positive outcome (v. 7) for those with heavy scales

**3. هَاوِيَة (hāwiyah)**
- **Root:** ه-و-ي | **Base verb:** هَوَى = "to fall, plunge"
- **Active participle meaning:** "The one that falls/is bottomless" — transforms the action of falling into a proper noun for a level of Hell
- **Narrative role:** Names the negative outcome (v. 9) for those with light scales

**4. حَامِيَة (hāmiyah)**
- **Root:** ح-م-ي | **Base verb:** حَمِيَ = "to be intensely hot"
- **Active participle meaning:** "The one that is scorching" — transforms the state of extreme heat into a defining quality of the Fire
- **Narrative role:** Closes the surah (v. 11), answering the final question

**Structural pattern:** The four participles map the surah's narrative arc: event (قَارِعَة) leads to judgment, which leads to either bliss (رَاضِيَة) or ruin (هَاوِيَة/حَامِيَة). The shared فَاعِلَة pattern unifies the surah phonetically while the meanings diverge thematically.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the two parallel conditional constructions in verses 6-7 and 8-9. Identify: (a) the shared grammatical structure, (b) the contrasting vocabulary, and (c) how the answer (jawab) in each pair differs in style and impact.">

**(a) Shared grammatical structure:**
Both pairs follow the identical pattern:
- [فَ/وَ] + أَمَّا + مَن + verb + مَوَازِينُهُ → فَ + jawab sentence
- Verse 6: فَأَمَّا مَن ثَقُلَتْ مَوَازِينُهُ → verse 7: فَهُوَ فِي عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ
- Verse 8: وَأَمَّا مَنْ خَفَّتْ مَوَازِينُهُ → verse 9: فَأُمُّهُ هَاوِيَةٌ
- Same particles (أَمَّا, مَن, فَ), same noun (مَوَازِينُهُ), same sentence type (nominal jawab)

**(b) Contrasting vocabulary:**
| Element | Verses 6-7 (positive) | Verses 8-9 (negative) |
|---------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Verb | ثَقُلَتْ (were heavy) | خَفَّتْ (were light) |
| Subject of jawab | هُوَ (he, personal pronoun) | أُمُّهُ (his mother/refuge, metaphor) |
| Destination | عِيشَة رَاضِيَة (pleasant life) | هَاوِيَة (the Abyss) |

**(c) Difference in jawab style and impact:**
- **Verse 7 (positive jawab):** Uses a straightforward nominal sentence: هُوَ + prepositional phrase (فِي عِيشَةٍ رَاضِيَةٍ). Direct, clear, comforting — "he is in a pleasant life."
- **Verse 9 (negative jawab):** Uses a metaphorical nominal sentence: أُمُّهُ + هَاوِيَةٌ. Instead of directly stating "he is in Hell," it uses the devastating metaphor of "his mother" being the Abyss. This is far more emotionally charged — the word "mother" (أُمّ) evokes safety and tenderness, but here it leads to the bottomless pit.
- The asymmetry in style (literal vs. metaphorical) makes the negative outcome more memorable and more terrifying, even though the grammar is equally simple.

## Grammar Summary

<Callout type="note" title="Key Grammar Concepts in This Surah">
- **Mubtada without khabar:** Verse 1 uses ٱلْقَارِعَةُ as a subject with no predicate, creating dramatic suspense through grammatical incompletion
- **Interrogative مَا constructions:** Verses 2, 3, 10 use مَا for rhetorical questions that magnify rather than seek information
- **وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ formula:** Verses 3 and 10 employ this standard Quranic formula (Form IV causative from د-ر-ي) to signal incomprehensible magnitude
- **كَانَ sentences with similes:** Verses 4-5 use يَكُونُ/تَكُونُ + كَ to construct vivid similes comparing people to moths and mountains to wool
- **Passive participles as adjectives:** ٱلْمَبْثُوث (scattered, from ب-ث-ث) and ٱلْمَنفُوش (carded, from ن-ف-ش) describe states of dissolution
- **فَأَمَّا...فَـ conditional construction:** Verses 6-7 and 8-9 use this pattern to categorize outcomes on the Day of Judgment
- **Relative pronoun مَن:** Introduces the subject in both conditional constructions (whoever's scales are heavy/light)
- **Active participles on فَاعِلَة pattern:** Four key words — ٱلْقَارِعَة, رَاضِيَة, هَاوِيَة, حَامِيَة — creating phonetic unity across the surah
- **Metaphorical أُمّ:** Verse 9 uses "his mother" metaphorically for "his refuge/dwelling," inverting the comforting connotation
- **Implied mubtada:** Verse 11 omits the subject (هِيَ) for immediate impact in answering the rhetorical question
- **Parallel structures:** Verses 4-5 (people/mountains) and verses 6-9 (heavy scales/light scales) create symmetrical contrasts
- **Emphasis through repetition:** ٱلْقَارِعَة appears three times in three verses (1-3), building a rhetorical crescendo
- **Indefinite tanwin for intensification:** نَارٌ حَامِيَةٌ uses indefinite forms to suggest boundless, immeasurable fire
- **Ring composition:** The وَمَا أَدْرَاكَ formula in verses 3 and 10 creates a structural frame around the central content

This surah is a masterclass in how Arabic grammar creates narrative tension: incomplete sentences build suspense (v1), rhetorical questions magnify importance (vv. 2-3), parallel constructions contrast fates (vv. 6-9), and stark brevity delivers the final answer (v11).
