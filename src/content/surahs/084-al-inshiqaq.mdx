</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Unique Grammatical Architecture of Al-Inshiqaq">
Al-Inshiqaq showcases several advanced grammatical structures that make it exceptional for Arabic study. First, the extended إِذَا conditional chain (vv. 1-5) builds dramatic tension across five verses before delivering its delayed jawab (answer) in verse 6 -- one of the longest protasis-apodosis gaps in the Quran. Second, the أَمَّا...فَ parallel structure (vv. 7-9 vs. 10-12) creates a perfect grammatical mirror contrasting the righteous (book in right hand) with the wicked (book behind the back). Third, the oath formula فَلَا أُقْسِمُ (v. 16) uses the particle لَا not for negation but for emphatic intensification of the oath. Fourth, the energetic mood verb تَرْكَبُنَّ (v. 19) with its nun of emphasis (nun thaqilah) is a rare and powerful form. Finally, the ironic use of بَشِّرْ ("give good news") in verse 24 for announcing punishment is a masterpiece of Quranic balagha, subverting the word's positive meaning into devastating sarcasm.

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ"
  transliteration="idha s-sama'u nshaqqat"
  translation="When the sky splits open"
  reference="Al-Inshiqaq 84:1"
  highlight="انشَقَّتْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | إِذَا | idha | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Not declinable (mabni), introduces protasis | when |
| 2 | السَّمَاءُ | as-sama'u | س م و | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the sky |
| 3 | انشَقَّتْ | inshaqqat | ش ق ق | Verb - Form VII, past, 3rd person feminine singular | Predicate (khabar) | split open |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form VII Reflexive: The Sky Splits Itself">
Form VII (infa'ala) indicates reflexive action -- the sky splits itself open by divine command. The pattern انشَقَّتْ (inshaqqat) from root ش-ق-ق shows the Form VII prefix اِنـ added to a doubled root, resulting in the geminated (mushaddad) قّ. This begins a conditional sequence paralleling Surah 81 (At-Takwir), where a series of إِذَا clauses build eschatological tension before the delayed jawab.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The إِذَا clause opens the protasis of a conditional sentence whose apodosis (jawab) is delayed until verse 6. السَّمَاءُ is nominative (marfu') as the subject (mubtada'), and انشَقَّتْ functions as the predicate (khabar). The clause إِذَا السَّمَاءُ انشَقَّتْ is a nominal sentence embedded within the temporal framework of إِذَا.

**Sarf (Morphology):** انشَقَّتْ is Form VII (infa'ala) from root ش-ق-ق. The pattern is اِنْفَعَلَ, but since the second and third radicals are identical (ق-ق), they merge into a geminate: اِنْشَقَّ. The ta' marbuta suffix marks feminine agreement with السَّمَاءُ.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Opening with إِذَا rather than إِنْ signals certainty -- this event WILL happen, not merely might happen. The reflexive Form VII suggests the sky acts upon itself, personifying creation as responsive to divine will. The dramatic opening immediately establishes the apocalyptic register of the surah.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ"
  transliteration="wa-adhinat li-rabbiha wa-huqqat"
  translation="And has responded to its Lord as it rightly should"
  reference="Al-Inshiqaq 84:2"
  highlight="أَذِنَتْ,حُقَّتْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | and |
| 2 | أَذِنَتْ | adhinat | أ ذ ن | Verb - Form I, past, 3rd person feminine singular | Main verb | listened/responded |
| 3 | لِ | li | - | Particle - preposition | Not declinable (mabni) | to/for |
| 4 | رَبِّهَا | rabbiha | ر ب ب | Noun - masculine, singular, definite + pronoun | Object of preposition li - genitive (majrur) | its Lord |
| 5 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | and |
| 6 | حُقَّتْ | huqqat | ح ق ق | Verb - Form I, past passive, 3rd person feminine singular | Coordinated verb - passive | was fitting/due |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice for Divine Decree: حُقَّتْ">
The verb حُقَّتْ (huqqat) is a passive form meaning "it was made right/due" -- the sky was MADE to obey, and this obedience was its rightful obligation. The passive construction removes the explicit agent (Allah), focusing instead on the inevitability and rightness of the action. Combined with أَذِنَتْ (listened/obeyed), this creates a vivid personification: creation hears its Lord's command and submits, as it was always destined to do.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Two coordinated verbal sentences joined by وَ. The verb أَذِنَتْ governs the prepositional phrase لِرَبِّهَا (with لِ indicating the one listened to). حُقَّتْ is a passive verb whose implied agent is Allah. The hidden subject of both verbs is السَّمَاءُ from verse 1.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَذِنَتْ is Form I from root أ-ذ-ن (to listen, to permit), conjugated with the feminine ta' suffix. حُقَّتْ is Form I passive from doubled root ح-ق-ق, where the damma on the first radical and fatha on the second mark the passive pattern (fu'ilat). The doubling (tashdid) on the ق reflects the merged identical radicals.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The personification of the sky "listening" to its Lord (أَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا) is a powerful rhetorical device (isti'arah makniyyah). The sky is metaphorically given the faculty of hearing and obedience. The addition of وَحُقَّتْ ("and it was fitting") serves as an emphatic affirmation -- not only does the sky obey, but this obedience is its inherent duty and nature.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ"
  transliteration="wa-idha l-ardu muddat"
  translation="And when the earth is stretched out"
  reference="Al-Inshiqaq 84:3"
  highlight="مُدَّتْ"
/>

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

<GrammarTable>
| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَ | wa | - | Particle - conjunction | Not declinable (mabni) | and |
| 2 | إِذَا | idha | - | Particle - conditional/temporal | Not declinable (mabni) | when |
| 3 | الْأَرْضُ | al-ardu | أ ر ض | Noun - feminine, singular, definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfu') | the earth |
| 4 | مُدَّتْ | muddat | م د د | Verb - Form I, past passive, 3rd person feminine singular | Predicate (khabar) - passive | was stretched |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice: Divine Agency Without Naming the Agent">
مُدَّتْ (muddat) is passive voice from root م-د-د -- the earth "is stretched/flattened" by divine power. The agent (Allah) is deliberately omitted, a pattern throughout these opening verses. This passive construction (majhul) emphasizes the ACTION happening to creation rather than the actor, creating an atmosphere where cosmic events unfold by an overwhelming, unnamed force -- which amplifies the sense of awe and inevitability.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This is the second إِذَا clause in the protasis chain. الْأَرْضُ is the mubtada' (nominative) and مُدَّتْ is the khabar (predicate). The conjunction وَ links this clause to verse 1, expanding the scope from heaven to earth.

**Sarf (Morphology):** مُدَّتْ is Form I passive from doubled root م-د-د. The passive pattern fu'ilat applied to a doubled root yields مُدَّتْ (with the identical second and third radicals merged under tashdid). The root م-د-د means "to extend, stretch, spread."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the sky splits (vertical drama), the earth stretches (horizontal expansion) -- the two dimensions of the cosmos are transformed. The shift from active-reflexive (انشَقَّتْ, Form VII) in verse 1 to passive (مُدَّتْ) in verse 3 subtly varies the rhetorical texture while maintaining the theme of creation yielding to divine command.

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ"
  transliteration="wa-alqat ma fiha wa-takhallat"
  translation="And casts out what is within it and empties itself"

  highlight="أَلْقَتْ,تَخَلَّتْ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Form IV and Form V: Two Types of Action">
This verse pairs two derived forms with distinct meanings. أَلْقَتْ (Form IV, af'ala) is causative/transitive -- the earth CAUSES what is within it to be thrown out. تَخَلَّتْ (Form V, tafa''ala) is reflexive -- the earth empties ITSELF. The progression from transitive to reflexive mirrors the complete process: first the earth ejects its contents (active, outward), then it abandons itself entirely (reflexive, inward).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Two coordinated verbal sentences. أَلْقَتْ governs the relative clause مَا فِيهَا as its object (maf'ul bihi). مَا is a relative pronoun in the accusative position, and فِيهَا is the prepositional phrase completing the relative clause (silat al-mawsul). تَخَلَّتْ is intransitive (no object needed -- the earth empties itself).

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَلْقَتْ is Form IV (af'ala) from root ل-ق-ي, with the characteristic hamza prefix alif. The Form IV pattern makes transitive what is intransitive in Form I. تَخَلَّتْ is Form V (tafa''ala) from root خ-ل-و (a defective root with و as third radical), giving the reflexive meaning of "making oneself empty/free."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The vivid imagery of earth throwing out its contents (dead bodies, treasures, minerals) and then emptying itself completely creates a scene of total cosmic upheaval. The personification continues from verses 1-3: the earth is not merely acted upon but actively participates in the Day of Judgment, yielding everything it has held back.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ"
  transliteration="wa-adhinat li-rabbiha wa-huqqat"
  translation="And has responded to its Lord as it rightly should"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Rhetorical Repetition (Takrar) for Emphasis">
This verse is an exact repetition of verse 2, now applied to the earth instead of the sky. This deliberate repetition (takrar) serves multiple purposes: it creates structural symmetry (sky section: vv. 1-2, earth section: vv. 3-5), emphasizes that ALL creation obeys its Lord, and creates a refrain-like pattern (muqabalah) that reinforces the universal theme. The identical wording underscores that heaven and earth share the same relationship of obedience to their Creator.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** Identical syntactic structure to verse 2. The hidden subject now refers to الْأَرْضُ (the earth) from verse 3, whereas in verse 2 it referred to السَّمَاءُ (the sky). This syntactic identity despite different referents demonstrates the universality of creation's obedience.

**Sarf (Morphology):** Same morphological forms as verse 2: أَذِنَتْ (Form I active, feminine) and حُقَّتْ (Form I passive, doubled root, feminine). No morphological variation from the earlier occurrence.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The repetition creates a powerful rhetorical parallelism (muqabalah). By framing both the sky section (vv. 1-2) and the earth section (vv. 3-5) with the identical refrain, the Quran establishes that the entire cosmos -- from the heavens above to the earth below -- responds obediently to its Lord. This sets up the devastating contrast with humanity in verse 6, who, unlike the obedient cosmos, labors heedlessly.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنسَانُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَدْحًا فَمُلَاقِيهِ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Delayed Jawab: Five Verses of Suspense">
Verse 6 is the apodosis (jawab) of the إِذَا conditional chain spanning verses 1-5. The protasis ("When the sky splits... and the earth stretches...") builds across five verses before finally delivering the answer: "O mankind, you are laboring toward your Lord." This is one of the longest delayed jawab structures in the Quran. The vocative يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنسَانُ marks a dramatic shift from cosmic events to direct human address, making the contrast between obedient creation and heedless humanity even more striking.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="Maf'ul Mutlaq: Emphasis Through Cognate Accusative">
The construction كَادِحٌ...كَدْحًا uses the active participle followed by its own masdar (verbal noun) as a maf'ul mutlaq (absolute/cognate accusative). This intensifies the meaning: not just "laboring" but "laboring with great labor." The masdar كَدْحًا is in the accusative (mansub) and shares the same root as the participle كَادِحٌ, creating an emphatic echo effect.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The verse contains multiple syntactic layers. يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنسَانُ is a formal vocative construction. إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ is an inna clause with the pronoun كَ as ism inna (accusative) and كَادِحٌ as khabar inna (nominative). The prepositional phrase إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ modifies كَادِحٌ. كَدْحًا is maf'ul mutlaq (accusative). فَمُلَاقِيهِ introduces the result clause with فَ, where مُلَاقِيهِ is a second predicate (khabar) with the pronoun هِ referring back to رَبِّكَ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** كَادِحٌ is an active participle (ism fa'il) on pattern فَاعِل from root ك-د-ح. كَدْحًا is the masdar on pattern فَعْل. مُلَاقِيهِ is an active participle of Form III (mufa'il) from root ل-ق-ي, with the attached pronoun هِ (genitive). The Form III pattern (مُفَاعِل) indicates reciprocal or directed action -- "one who meets/encounters."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The shift from cosmic imagery (vv. 1-5) to direct human address creates maximum rhetorical impact. The active participle كَادِحٌ (present, ongoing) conveys that the laboring is continuous and inescapable. The fa' in فَمُلَاقِيهِ is fa' al-'atf with a consequential nuance: your laboring inevitably LEADS TO meeting Him. The ambiguity of the pronoun هِ (does it refer to رَبّ or كَدْح -- "meeting Him" or "meeting [the result of] your labor"?) enriches the meaning, as both readings are valid and complementary.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The أَمَّا...فَ Construction: Conditional Distribution">
The particle أَمَّا introduces a topicalization/conditional structure that ALWAYS requires فَ in its apodosis (the result clause, which comes in verse 8). The structure is: أَمَّا + subject/condition + فَ + result. This is one of the most recognizable grammatical patterns in Quranic Arabic, used to distribute cases and create parallel contrasts. Here it begins the first case (righteous), with the second case (wicked) introduced by وَأَمَّا in verse 10.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is conjunctive, linking to the preceding context. أَمَّا is a conditional/topicalizing particle. مَنْ is a relative pronoun functioning as mubtada' (nominative). أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ is the relative clause (silat al-mawsul): أُوتِيَ is a passive verb, and كِتَابَهُ is the na'ib fa'il (deputy subject, nominative). بِيَمِينِهِ is an adverbial prepositional phrase indicating manner/location.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أُوتِيَ is the passive of Form IV (أَعْطَى/آتَى) from root أ-ت-ي. The passive pattern for Form IV is أُفْعِلَ, giving أُوتِيَ. كِتَابَهُ follows pattern فِعَال from root ك-ت-ب, with the attached possessive pronoun هُ. يَمِينِهِ from root ي-م-ن originally means "right side" and by extension "oath, blessing."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** Receiving the book in the right hand (بِيَمِينِهِ) symbolizes honor and salvation in Arabic culture, where the right hand represents blessing and the left/behind represents disgrace. The passive أُوتِيَ (was given) emphasizes that the book is bestowed by divine decree, not earned by human effort alone. The أَمَّا structure creates anticipation -- the listener knows a contrasting case must follow.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Maf'ul Mutlaq with Adjective: Qualifying the Type of Action">
حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا is a maf'ul mutlaq (cognate accusative) modified by an adjective. The maf'ul mutlaq here does not merely intensify (as in كَدْحًا in v. 6) but specifies the TYPE of action: not just "accounting" but "easy accounting." The adjective يَسِيرًا agrees with the masdar in case (accusative), gender (masculine), and number (singular).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ marks the apodosis (jawab) of the أَمَّا conditional from verse 7. سَوْفَ is a future particle governing the present tense verb يُحَاسَبُ. حِسَابًا is maf'ul mutlaq (accusative), and يَسِيرًا is its adjective (also accusative). The passive construction يُحَاسَبُ has an implied agent (Allah) and the hidden na'ib fa'il is the person mentioned in verse 7.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُحَاسَبُ is Form III passive (yufa'alu) from root ح-س-ب. Form III (فَاعَلَ) often indicates mutual action or directed engagement -- حَاسَبَ means "to hold to account, to reckon with." The passive يُحَاسَبُ means "he is held to account." حِسَابًا is the masdar on pattern فِعَال, and يَسِيرًا is on pattern فَعِيل meaning "easy."

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The juxtaposition of سَوْفَ (indicating future certainty) with the passive voice creates a sense of gentle inevitability for the righteous. The "easy accounting" contrasts with the implied difficult accounting of the wicked. The word يَسِيرًا shares the root ي-س-ر with the concept of ease and blessing, adding semantic depth.

### Verse 9

  arabic="وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُورًا"
  transliteration="wa-yanqalibu ila ahlihi masruran"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Hal (Circumstantial Accusative): Describing State During Action">
مَسْرُورًا is a hal (circumstantial expression) in the accusative case, describing the state of the subject WHILE performing the action. It answers the question "In what state does he return?" -- he returns WHILE BEING delighted. The hal construction requires the accusative case and typically modifies an indefinite adjective/participle describing a definite subject. Here مَسْرُورًا (indefinite, accusative) describes the implied هُوَ (definite, nominative).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَنقَلِبُ is coordinated with the preceding clause via وَ. The prepositional phrase إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ specifies the destination. مَسْرُورًا is in the accusative as a hal (circumstantial state), modifying the subject of يَنقَلِبُ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَنقَلِبُ is Form VII (yanfa'ilu) from root ق-ل-ب. The Form VII اِنْفَعَلَ pattern gives reflexive meaning: "to turn oneself, to return." مَسْرُورًا is a passive participle (maf'ul) from doubled root س-ر-ر on pattern مَفْعُول, meaning "one who has been made joyful" -- the joy is bestowed upon him.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The word مَسْرُورًا will appear again in verse 13 in a devastating ironic contrast. Here it describes the eternal joy of the righteous returning to their family in Paradise. In verse 13, the same word describes the wicked person's fleeting worldly joy that led to his downfall. This deliberate repetition with reversed meaning is a powerful rhetorical device (muqabalah).

### Verse 10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ"
  transliteration="wa-amma man utiya kitabahu wara'a zahrihi"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Parallel أَمَّا Structure: Structural Mirror">
This verse mirrors verse 7 precisely in its grammatical structure: أَمَّا + مَنْ + أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ + location. The only difference is the location: بِيَمِينِهِ (in his right hand) vs. وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ (behind his back). This perfect syntactic parallelism forces the listener to compare the two cases directly. The وَ before أَمَّا adds a contrastive nuance ("but as for..."), setting up the contrast.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** The structure mirrors verse 7: أَمَّا + مَنْ (mubtada') + relative clause (أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ). The key difference is the adverbial of place: وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ is a zarf makan (accusative) in an idafah construction: وَرَاءَ (mudaf, accusative) + ظَهْرِ (mudaf ilayhi, genitive) + هِ (possessive pronoun). The jawab of this أَمَّا comes in verse 11.

**Sarf (Morphology):** وَرَاءَ is a non-declinable adverb of place (zarf makan ghayr mutasarrif), always in the accusative. ظَهْرِهِ from root ظ-ه-ر on pattern فَعْل means "back." The combination "behind his back" is a compound locative expression.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** While Surah Al-Haqqah (69:25) describes the wicked receiving the book in the left hand (بِشِمَالِهِ), here the expression is even more humiliating -- behind the back (وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ). Some scholars explain that the wicked person's right hand is chained to his neck and his left is twisted behind his back, forcing the book to be given from behind. The spatial imagery (right hand = honor; behind the back = shame) is immediately understood across cultures.

### Verse 11

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا"
  transliteration="fa-sawfa yad'u thuburan"
  translation="He will cry out for destruction"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Structural Contrast: Verse 8 vs. Verse 11">
The apodosis of the first أَمَّا (v. 8) was فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا (easy reckoning). The apodosis of the second أَمَّا (v. 11) is فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا (crying for destruction). Both begin with فَسَوْفَ, creating rhythmic parallelism, but the content is starkly opposite: peaceful accounting vs. desperate wailing. The grammatical mirror amplifies the moral contrast.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ marks the jawab (apodosis) of the أَمَّا in verse 10. سَوْفَ is a future particle. يَدْعُو is Form I present indicative (marfu') from root د-ع-و. ثُبُورًا is the maf'ul bihi (direct object) in the accusative. The expression يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا literally means "he calls for destruction" -- invoking his own ruin.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَدْعُو from root د-ع-و is a defective verb (the third radical و appears in the present form). ثُبُورًا from root ث-ب-ر on pattern فُعُول is a masdar meaning "destruction, ruin, perdition." The pattern فُعُول often indicates intensity or completeness of the verbal meaning.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The contrast between مَسْرُورًا (delighted, v. 9) and ثُبُورًا (destruction, v. 11) is devastating. Where the righteous person returns joyfully, the wicked person calls out for his own annihilation. The verb يَدْعُو (he calls) implies active desperation -- not merely experiencing destruction but begging for it as a release from an even worse fate.

### Verse 12

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَيَصْلَىٰ سَعِيرًا"
  transliteration="wa-yasla sa'iran"
  translation="And he will burn in a Blaze"
  reference="Al-Inshiqaq 84:12"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="يَصْلَىٰ: Entering and Enduring Fire">
The verb يَصْلَىٰ (yasla) from root ص-ل-ي means not merely to burn but to ENTER INTO and ENDURE fire. It implies sustained exposure and suffering, not a momentary contact. سَعِيرًا can function as either a direct object (maf'ul bihi: "he enters a blaze") or as an adverbial accusative of place (zarf: "he burns in a blaze"). Both readings convey the same terrifying meaning. This completes the wicked person's fate: despair (v. 11) followed by eternal punishment (v. 12).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** يَصْلَىٰ is coordinated with يَدْعُو (v. 11) via وَ. سَعِيرًا is in the accusative, analyzable as either maf'ul bihi (direct object) or zarf (adverbial of place). The concise two-word sentence (plus conjunction) mirrors the finality of the punishment.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يَصْلَىٰ is Form I from the defective root ص-ل-ي (third radical ي). The present tense follows the pattern يَفْعَلُ. سَعِيرًا from root س-ع-ر on pattern فَعِيل carries the intensive/descriptive meaning of "blazing, fiercely burning." The فَعِيل pattern often functions as both adjective and noun.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The progression from verse 9 (returning to family in joy) to verse 12 (burning in a blaze) creates the starkest possible contrast in just four verses. The wicked person's journey: receiving the book in shame (v. 10) leads to despair (v. 11) leads to eternal fire (v. 12). Each step escalates the horror. The brevity of verse 12 (three words) mirrors the finality and inescapability of the punishment.

### Verse 13

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Ironic Repetition: مَسْرُورًا in Two Contexts">
The word مَسْرُورًا appeared in verse 9 describing the righteous person's eternal joy in Paradise. Here the SAME word describes the wicked person's temporary worldly joy among his people. The grammatical roles differ: in verse 9, مَسْرُورًا is a hal (circumstantial accusative), describing the state during return. In verse 13, it is the khabar of كَانَ (predicate of the incomplete verb), describing his habitual past state. The same word, the same meaning, but two radically different contexts -- one leads to salvation, the other to damnation.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِنَّ governs the pronoun هُ as its ism (accusative). كَانَ is an incomplete verb (fi'l naqis) whose khabar is مَسْرُورًا (accusative, as required by kana). فِي أَهْلِهِ is a prepositional phrase functioning as a secondary predicate or adverbial modifier within the kana clause.

**Sarf (Morphology):** كَانَ is Form I from hollow root ك-و-ن. مَسْرُورًا is a passive participle (ism maf'ul) from doubled root س-ر-ر on pattern مَفْعُول. The passive participle form indicates that the joy was "caused upon him" -- it was bestowed (by worldly pleasures) rather than earned through righteousness.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse provides the backstory explaining WHY the wicked person receives punishment. The causal link (إِنَّهُ = "indeed he...") reveals that his worldly joy was heedless and ungrateful. The ironic contrast with verse 9 is devastating: the righteous person's مَسْرُورًا is eternal and earned; the wicked person's مَسْرُورًا was temporary and led to ruin. The choice of فِي أَهْلِهِ (among his people) parallels إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ (to his people) in verse 9 -- both mention family, but in opposite trajectories.

### Verse 14

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ أَن لَّن يَحُورَ"
  transliteration="innahu zanna an lan yahura"
  translation="Indeed, he thought he would never return [to Allah]"

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Masdar Mu'awwal: The Interpreted Infinitive">
The construction أَن لَّن يَحُورَ is a masdar mu'awwal (interpreted infinitive/infinitival clause). The particle أَنْ combines with the negated subjunctive verb لَن يَحُورَ to form a clause that functions as the object of ظَنَّ. Since ظَنَّ is a "verb of the heart" (af'al al-qulub) that governs two objects, the masdar mu'awwal fills the role of both objects in a compressed form: "He thought [his non-return]" = "He thought he would never return."
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِنَّهُ ظَنَّ follows the same pattern as verse 13 (inna + khabar clause). ظَنَّ is a verb of the heart (fi'l qalbi) that can govern two objects. Here its two objects are compressed into the masdar mu'awwal أَنْ لَن يَحُورَ. The particle لَن governs يَحُورَ into the subjunctive (mansub), marked by the fatha ending.

**Sarf (Morphology):** ظَنَّ is Form I from doubled root ظ-ن-ن (the two identical radicals merge under tashdid). يَحُورَ is Form I from hollow root ح-و-ر, following the pattern يَفْعُلُ. The root ح-و-ر means "to return, to come back" and is relatively rare in the Quran, making its use here distinctive.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The root ح-و-ر (to return) echoes the broader theme of returning to Allah established in verse 6 (مُلَاقِيهِ -- meeting Him). The wicked person's fundamental error was not a specific sin but a metaphysical denial: he thought he would never return to face his Creator. The emphatic لَن (never) reveals the absoluteness of his denial, and the double emphasis of إِنَّهُ... أَن underscores the certainty of his delusion.

### Verse 15

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="بَلَىٰ: The Particle That Contradicts Negation">
بَلَىٰ is a unique Arabic particle used specifically to AFFIRM what was negated. Unlike نَعَمْ (yes, confirming a statement), بَلَىٰ contradicts a preceding negation. Here it responds to the wicked person's assumption أَن لَن يَحُورَ ("he would never return"): "On the contrary -- he WILL return!" The triple emphasis that follows (بَلَىٰ + إِنَّ + كَانَ) creates one of the most emphatic affirmations possible in Arabic: contrary to his assumption, his Lord was ALWAYS watching.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** بَلَىٰ contradicts the negation in verse 14. إِنَّ governs رَبَّهُ as its ism (accusative). كَانَ is the khabar of إِنَّ, introducing a nested predicate structure: the khabar of كَانَ is بَصِيرًا (accusative). بِهِ is a prepositional phrase modifying بَصِيرًا, specifying what Allah sees.

**Sarf (Morphology):** بَصِيرًا is on pattern فَعِيل from root ب-ص-ر, an intensive adjective form meaning "All-Seeing, Ever-Perceiving." The فَعِيل pattern in divine attributes carries a superlative/intensive force beyond the basic active participle بَاصِر.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse delivers a devastating rebuttal. The wicked person thought he was invisible to divine oversight (لَن يَحُورَ -- no return, no accountability). بَلَىٰ shatters this illusion. The choice of بَصِيرًا (All-Seeing) is pointed: his deeds were not merely known but SEEN. The past tense كَانَ indicates that Allah was ALWAYS seeing him -- before, during, and after his heedless joy. The triple emphasis (بَلَىٰ + إِنَّ + كَانَ + بَصِيرًا as intensive adjective) is among the strongest affirmative structures in Quranic Arabic.

### Verse 16

<Callout type="rule" title="فَلَا أُقْسِمُ: Emphatic Oath, Not Negation">
The formula فَلَا أُقْسِمُ ("I do not swear" or "nay, I swear") is a distinctive Quranic oath construction. Despite containing لَا (typically negative), this is NOT a negation of the oath. Classical grammarians explain لَا here as either: (1) a redundant/emphatic particle (la za'idah) that intensifies rather than negates, or (2) a rhetorical device meaning "the matter is so obvious it needs no oath, but I swear anyway." This formula appears also in Surah Al-Qiyamah (75:1) and Al-Waqi'ah (56:75). It begins a triple oath sequence (vv. 16-18) leading to the sworn statement in verse 19.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is conjunctive, transitioning to a new section. لَا is an emphatic/redundant particle (not negation). أُقْسِمُ is Form IV present indicative (1st person singular). بِالشَّفَقِ is the prepositional phrase indicating the object of the oath (muqsam bihi), with الشَّفَقِ in the genitive (majrur).

**Sarf (Morphology):** أُقْسِمُ is Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) from root ق-س-م, with the characteristic damma on the prefix and kasra on the second radical in the present tense. الشَّفَقِ from root ش-ف-ق on pattern فَعَل refers to the red/golden glow remaining on the horizon after sunset.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The choice of الشَّفَقِ (twilight) as the first object of oath is deeply connected to the surah's themes. Twilight is the moment of transition between day and night -- paralleling the surah's theme of transition between life and death, and between this world and the next. It is also a phenomenon of beauty tinged with melancholy, mirroring the mixed fates described in the preceding verses.

**Nahw (Syntax):** وَاللَّيْلِ is the second oath object, with وَ functioning as the oath conjunction (wa al-qasam) and اللَّيْلِ in the genitive. وَمَا وَسَقَ adds a third oath element: مَا is a relative pronoun (ism mawsul) with وَسَقَ as its relative clause (silat al-mawsul). The hidden return pronoun ('a'id) in وَسَقَ refers back to اللَّيْلِ.

**Sarf (Morphology):** اللَّيْلِ from root ل-ي-ل on pattern فَعْل. وَسَقَ is Form I from root و-س-ق, a sound verb following the standard past tense conjugation. The root carries meanings of gathering, loading (as in loading a camel), and encompassing.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The oath progresses from twilight (الشَّفَقِ, v. 16) to night (اللَّيْلِ, v. 17) to the full moon (الْقَمَرِ, v. 18) -- a temporal sequence tracking the evening sky. This progression mirrors the surah's own movement from the drama of Judgment Day to the peaceful certainty of divine truth. Night "enveloping" its creatures is a tender image that contrasts with the apocalyptic violence of the opening verses.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form VIII Reflexive from the Same Root as Verse 17">
اتَّسَقَ (ittasaqa) is Form VIII (ifta'ala) from the same root و-س-ق that appeared in verse 17 (وَسَقَ). Form VIII adds reflexive/intensive meaning: while وَسَقَ means "it gathered (others)," اتَّسَقَ means "it gathered/completed ITSELF" -- the moon perfecting its own form into fullness. Note the assimilation: the original Form VIII pattern would be اِوْتَسَقَ, but the weak initial و assimilates with the infixed تَ, producing اتَّسَقَ with tashdid on the ta'.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** الْقَمَرِ is the fourth and final oath object (genitive). إِذَا اتَّسَقَ is a temporal/conditional clause modifying الْقَمَرِ, specifying the condition under which the oath applies: "the moon WHEN it becomes full." The jawab (response) of all four oaths comes in verse 19.

**Sarf (Morphology):** اتَّسَقَ is Form VIII from root و-س-ق. The initial weak radical و undergoes assimilation with the Form VIII infix تَ: اِوْتَسَقَ becomes اِتَّسَقَ (with tashdid). This is a standard morphophonemic rule for Form VIII with initial و roots. The Form VIII pattern adds reflexive meaning: the moon gathers/completes itself.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The moon becoming full (اتَّسَقَ) symbolizes completion and perfection -- a fitting climax to the oath sequence that began with twilight and moved through night. The full moon represents the culmination of a process, just as the Day of Judgment is the culmination of human existence. The triple oath (twilight, night, full moon) forms a complete temporal arc of the evening sky, each element more luminous than the last, building toward the emphatic sworn statement.

<Callout type="rule" title="The Energetic Mood (Nun al-Tawkid al-Thaqilah)">
تَرْكَبُنَّ features the energetic mood (al-mudari' al-mu'akkad), formed by attaching the heavy nun of emphasis (nun al-tawkid al-thaqilah, نَّ) to the present tense verb. This mood appears specifically in the jawab al-qasam (oath response) context after the lam of the oath (لَـ). The combination لَـ...ـنَّ creates maximum emphasis: "you will SURELY, CERTAINLY ride." The energetic mood is one of the rarest verb forms in Arabic, making this verse grammatically significant.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** This verse is the jawab al-qasam (response to the oath) for the triple oath in verses 16-18. لَـ is the lam of the oath response (lam al-qasam). تَرْكَبُنَّ is in the energetic mood, which is triggered by the oath context. طَبَقًا عَن طَبَقٍ is an adverbial expression meaning "stage after stage," with طَبَقًا in the accusative (as adverbial/object) and عَن طَبَقٍ as a prepositional phrase.

**Sarf (Morphology):** تَرْكَبُنَّ is Form I from root ر-ك-ب. The base form is تَرْكَبُونَ (2nd person masculine plural, indicative). When the heavy nun of emphasis (نَّ) is added, the وَ of the plural marker and the نَ of the original ending drop, leaving تَرْكَبُنَّ. This morphological process: تَرْكَبُونَ → تَرْكَبُو + نَّ → تَرْكَبُنَّ (with the waw deleted before the nun).

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The expression طَبَقًا عَن طَبَقٍ ("state after state") is deliberately ambiguous, encompassing multiple interpretations: from this world to the next, from ease to hardship, from life to death to resurrection. This open-endedness is itself a rhetorical device -- the listener can apply it to any transition in the human experience. The rare energetic mood verb form adds a sense of divine certainty and urgency that matches the eschatological content.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="Rhetorical Question: Expressing Astonishment and Rebuke">
فَمَا لَهُمْ لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ is a rhetorical question (istifham inkari) that does not seek an answer but expresses astonishment and rebuke. The interrogative مَا combined with the prepositional phrase لَهُمْ literally means "what is with/for them" -- implying "what is wrong with them." The negative clause لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ functions as a hal (circumstantial clause) explaining the bewildering situation: they persist in disbelief despite all the evidence presented.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** مَا is an interrogative pronoun (ism istifham). لَهُمْ is a prepositional phrase functioning as khabar muqaddam (fronted predicate). The implied mubtada' mu'akhkhar (delayed subject) is understood from context. لَا يُؤْمِنُونَ is a negative verbal clause functioning as a hal (circumstantial expression) in the accusative position.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُؤْمِنُونَ is Form IV (يُفْعِلُونَ) from root أ-م-ن. The Form IV pattern (أَفْعَلَ) here conveys the meaning "to believe, to have faith" -- the causative sense is "to make oneself secure (in faith)." The present tense indicates ongoing, persistent disbelief.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** After the cosmic oaths and the sworn statement about human progression, the rhetorical question creates a sudden shift to direct confrontation. The question implies that disbelief is irrational given the overwhelming evidence of divine power (cosmic events, oaths by nature, inevitable human progression). The shift from second person (تَرْكَبُنَّ, v. 19) to third person (لَهُمْ) creates distance -- the disbelievers are now spoken ABOUT rather than TO, a form of rhetorical dismissal.

### Verse 21

<Callout type="rule" title="Passive Voice: الْقُرْآنُ as Na'ib al-Fa'il">
قُرِئَ is passive voice (مبني للمجهول), turning الْقُرْآنُ from a direct object into a na'ib al-fa'il (deputy subject) in the nominative. The original active sentence would be: قَرَأَ [القارئُ] الْقُرْآنَ عَلَيْهِمْ. The passive removes the reciter, focusing entirely on the Quran itself and the disbelievers' response to it. This verse contains a sajda mark (۩), indicating a point of prostration during recitation (sajdat al-tilawah).
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِذَا introduces a temporal/conditional clause with قُرِئَ as its verb (passive). الْقُرْآنُ is the na'ib fa'il (deputy subject, nominative). عَلَيْهِمُ is a prepositional phrase indicating the recipients. The jawab of إِذَا is لَا يَسْجُدُونَ (a negative verbal sentence).

**Sarf (Morphology):** قُرِئَ is the passive of Form I from root ق-ر-أ. The passive pattern changes the vowels from قَرَأَ (fatha-fatha-fatha) to قُرِئَ (damma-kasra-fatha). يَسْجُدُونَ is Form I from root س-ج-د on pattern يَفْعُلُونَ.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The verse builds on the rhetorical question of verse 20 by adding a specific charge: not only do they not believe, but when the Quran itself is recited to them, they refuse even the physical act of prostration. The inclusion of the sajda mark (۩) creates an immediate test for the listener: will YOU prostrate when hearing this verse, or will you be like those described? The passive construction elevates the Quran above any individual reciter, making the refusal a rejection of the divine word itself.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="tip" title="بَلِ: Corrective Escalation">
بَلِ (bal) is a corrective particle that dismisses the preceding statement and introduces something stronger. After asking "why don't they believe?" (v. 20) and "why don't they prostrate?" (v. 21), بَلِ escalates: "No -- the problem is deeper. They actively DENY (يُكَذِّبُونَ)." The Form II intensive يُكَذِّبُونَ (from كَذَّبَ, not just كَذَبَ) indicates deliberate, persistent, emphatic denial -- not mere disbelief but active rejection and accusation of falsehood.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** بَلِ is an idrab particle (corrective/escalatory). الَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا is a relative clause functioning as the mubtada' (subject). يُكَذِّبُونَ is the khabar (predicate). The sentence is a nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah) with a verbal predicate.

**Sarf (Morphology):** يُكَذِّبُونَ is Form II (يُفَعِّلُونَ) from root ك-ذ-ب. Form II (فَعَّلَ) often adds intensity to Form I. While كَذَبَ means "to lie," كَذَّبَ means "to declare something false, to reject as a lie, to deny emphatically." The Form II intensification turns passive disbelief into active denial.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The rhetorical escalation across three verses (20-22) mirrors the escalation of the disbelievers' culpability: first, they don't believe (passive failure); then, they don't prostrate (active refusal); finally, they actively deny (aggressive rejection). بَلِ marks each escalation. The use of the present tense يُكَذِّبُونَ (ongoing) rather than past tense emphasizes that their denial is persistent and continuing.

<Callout type="rule" title="Ism al-Tafdil (Elative/Superlative): أَعْلَمُ">
أَعْلَمُ is an ism al-tafdil (elative form) on pattern أَفْعَل from root ع-ل-م. When applied to Allah, the elative form does not mean "more knowing than others" (comparative) but "most knowing absolutely" (superlative). The structure أَعْلَمُ بِـ ("most knowing of") uses بِ to indicate the object of knowledge. This nominal sentence (اللَّهُ أَعْلَمُ) is a powerful declaration: no matter what they conceal, Allah's knowledge encompasses it completely.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** A nominal sentence: اللَّهُ is mubtada' (nominative) and أَعْلَمُ is khabar (nominative). بِمَا يُوعُونَ is a prepositional phrase with a relative clause: بِ + مَا (relative pronoun) + يُوعُونَ (silat al-mawsul). The ism al-tafdil أَعْلَمُ is diptote (mamnu' min al-sarf) -- it does not take tanwin.

**Sarf (Morphology):** أَعْلَمُ follows the أَفْعَل pattern of the elative from root ع-ل-م. يُوعُونَ is Form I (يَفْعُلُونَ variant يُفْعِلُونَ) from root و-ع-ي, meaning "to keep, retain, preserve, conceal." The root carries the sense of containing something within oneself -- their hidden motives and secrets.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** This verse serves as a divine response to the disbelievers' denial (v. 22). They may deny outwardly, but Allah knows what they conceal inwardly. The juxtaposition of their denial (يُكَذِّبُونَ) with Allah's omniscience (أَعْلَمُ بِمَا يُوعُونَ) implies that their denial is futile. The verb يُوعُونَ suggests a deliberate concealment -- they know the truth but choose to hide it and deny it publicly.

</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="rule" title="Ironic بَشِّرْ: 'Good News' of Punishment">
بَشِّرْ is a Form II imperative from root ب-ش-ر, which normally means "to give GOOD news, to deliver glad tidings." Using it here for announcing punishment (بِعَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ) is a devastating example of irony (ta'rid/tahakkum). The listener expects بَشِّرْ to precede something positive (as in بَشِّرْهُم بِجَنَّاتٍ -- "give them glad tidings of gardens"). Instead, the "good news" is painful punishment. This rhetorical device (using a positive word in a negative context) intensifies the mockery and finality of the judgment.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** فَ is resultative, connecting the command to the preceding context (their denial + Allah's knowledge = their punishment). بَشِّرْ is a Form II imperative (fi'l amr) with the attached pronoun هُم as direct object. بِعَذَابٍ is a prepositional phrase indicating the content of the "tidings." أَلِيمٍ is an adjective in the genitive, agreeing with عَذَابٍ in case, gender, number, and indefiniteness.

**Sarf (Morphology):** بَشِّرْ is Form II imperative from root ب-ش-ر. The Form II pattern (فَعَّلَ) adds transitivity and intensity: بَشَرَ (Form I) means "to be happy," while بَشَّرَ (Form II) means "to make someone happy / give good news." The imperative form drops the prefix تَـ and takes sukun: بَشِّرْ. عَذَابٍ from root ع-ذ-ب on pattern فَعَال, and أَلِيمٍ on pattern فَعِيل (intensive adjective meaning "very painful").

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The irony of بَشِّرْ is one of the most memorable rhetorical devices in this surah. It is a form of tahakkum (sarcasm) and ta'rid (indirect expression). The command is addressed to the Prophet Muhammad, making it a formal divine decree delivered through prophetic authority. The indefiniteness of عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ (without الـ) suggests an unspecified, perhaps unimaginable, type of painful punishment -- leaving its nature open to dread.

### Verse 25

<Callout type="rule" title="Inverted Nominal Sentence: لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ">
The normal Arabic word order would be أَجْرٌ لَهُمْ ("a reward is for them"). The verse inverts this to لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ (khabar muqaddam + mubtada' mu'akhkhar) -- "FOR THEM is a reward." This taqdim (fronting) of the predicate serves emphasis: the focus is on the RECIPIENTS (them, the believers), stressing that this reward is exclusively theirs. The inverted nominal sentence is a common emphatic device in Quranic Arabic.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip" title="غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ: A Reward Without Strings">
غَيْرُ مَمْنُونٍ has two complementary meanings. First, from the root م-ن-ن meaning "to cut off," it means "uninterrupted" -- a reward that never ceases. Second, from the same root meaning "to remind of a favor," it means "without reproach" -- a reward given freely without being reminded of it as a debt. Both meanings apply simultaneously: the believers' reward is eternal AND given graciously, without any diminishment or guilt.
</Callout>

#### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (Syntax):** إِلَّا introduces an exception (istithna') from the general punishment in verse 24. الَّذِينَ is the mustathna (excepted party) in the accusative. The relative clause آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ qualifies the exception. لَهُمْ أَجْرٌ is an inverted nominal sentence: لَهُمْ is khabar muqaddam (prepositional phrase serving as predicate), and أَجْرٌ is mubtada' mu'akhkhar (delayed subject, nominative). غَيْرُ is an adjective in an idafah with مَمْنُونٍ (mudaf ilayhi, genitive).

**Sarf (Morphology):** آمَنُوا is Form IV past from root أ-م-ن. عَمِلُوا is Form I past from root ع-م-ل. الصَّالِحَاتِ is the feminine sound plural of صَالِحَة (active participle from ص-ل-ح), in the accusative (marked by kasra for sound feminine plurals). مَمْنُونٍ is a passive participle (maf'ul) from root م-ن-ن on pattern مَفْعُول.

**Balagha (Rhetoric):** The surah ends with mercy after severity -- a common Quranic pattern. After describing punishment for deniers (v. 24), the exception (إِلَّا) offers hope for believers. The standard Quranic formula آمَنُوا وَعَمِلُوا الصَّالِحَاتِ pairs faith with action, emphasizing that belief alone is insufficient without righteous deeds. The final word مَمْنُونٍ ("interrupted/diminished") is negated by غَيْرُ, ending the surah on a note of eternal, unconditional divine generosity -- the perfect contrast to the عَذَابٍ أَلِيمٍ of the previous verse.

3. وَإِذَا الْأَرْضُ مُدَّتْ -- "And when the earth is stretched out" (v. 3)
4. وَأَلْقَتْ مَا فِيهَا وَتَخَلَّتْ -- "And casts out what is within it and empties itself" (v. 4)
5. وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ -- "And has responded to its Lord as it rightly should" (v. 5)

**Apodosis (Jawab, v. 6):**
يَا أَيُّهَا الْإِنسَانُ إِنَّكَ كَادِحٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ كَدْحًا فَمُلَاقِيهِ -- "O mankind, indeed you are laboring toward your Lord with great labor, and you will meet Him"

**Thematic Connection:**
The protasis describes how the ENTIRE cosmos (heaven and earth) obeys Allah's command without hesitation -- the sky splits, the earth stretches and empties, and both "respond to their Lord as they rightly should" (وَأَذِنَتْ لِرَبِّهَا وَحُقَّتْ). This cosmic obedience sets up a powerful implicit question: if even the inanimate cosmos submits to Allah, what about you, O human? The jawab then addresses mankind directly, reminding them that they too are on a journey toward Allah (كَادِحٌ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ) and will inevitably meet Him (فَمُلَاقِيهِ). The contrast is between creation that obeys willingly and humans who may resist -- yet the outcome (meeting Allah) is inescapable for both.

<ExerciseBox question="Compare the two أَمَّا...فَ structures in verses 7-9 and 10-12. For each structure, identify: (a) the أَمَّا clause, (b) the فَ apodosis, (c) the key vocabulary differences, and (d) the grammatical parallels that highlight the moral contrast.">

**First أَمَّا Structure (The Righteous, vv. 7-9):**
- **(a) أَمَّا clause (v. 7):** فَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ بِيَمِينِهِ -- "As for whoever is given his record in his right hand"
- **(b) فَ apodosis (vv. 8-9):** فَسَوْفَ يُحَاسَبُ حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا / وَيَنقَلِبُ إِلَىٰ أَهْلِهِ مَسْرُورًا -- "He will be judged with an easy accounting / And will return to his people in happiness"

**Second أَمَّا Structure (The Wicked, vv. 10-12):**
- **(a) أَمَّا clause (v. 10):** وَأَمَّا مَنْ أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ -- "But as for whoever is given his record behind his back"
- **(b) فَ apodosis (vv. 11-12):** فَسَوْفَ يَدْعُو ثُبُورًا / وَيَصْلَىٰ سَعِيرًا -- "He will cry out for destruction / And will burn in a Blaze"

**Key Vocabulary Differences:**
| Element | Righteous (vv. 7-9) | Wicked (vv. 10-12) |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Location of book | بِيَمِينِهِ (right hand) | وَرَاءَ ظَهْرِهِ (behind his back) |
| Outcome verb | يُحَاسَبُ (passive: judged) | يَدْعُو (active: cries out) |
| Outcome object | حِسَابًا يَسِيرًا (easy accounting) | ثُبُورًا (destruction) |
| Final state | مَسْرُورًا (delighted) | سَعِيرًا (a blaze) |

**Grammatical Parallels:**
Both structures use identical syntax: أَمَّا + مَنْ + أُوتِيَ كِتَابَهُ + [location] / فَسَوْفَ + [verb] + [accusative noun] / وَ + [verb] + [accusative noun]. This perfect parallelism forces the listener to compare each element directly. The فَسَوْفَ opening in both apodoses creates rhythmic symmetry, while the contrasting content (ease vs. destruction, joy vs. fire) creates maximum moral contrast through identical grammatical frames.

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the passive voice constructions in this surah. List every passive verb, identify its form, and explain the theological significance of using passive voice in each case (i.e., why is the agent omitted?).">

**Passive Verbs in Al-Inshiqaq:**

1. **حُقَّتْ** (huqqat, vv. 2, 5) -- Form I passive from ح-ق-ق
   - Meaning: "it was made fitting/due"
   - Agent omitted: Allah made obedience fitting for creation. The passive emphasizes the INEVITABILITY of the decree rather than the decreer.

2. **مُدَّتْ** (muddat, v. 3) -- Form I passive from م-د-د
   - Meaning: "it was stretched out"
   - Agent omitted: Allah stretches the earth. The passive focuses on the TRANSFORMATION of the earth, creating an impersonal sense of cosmic events unfolding.

3. **أُوتِيَ** (utiya, vv. 7, 10) -- Form IV passive from أ-ت-ي
   - Meaning: "he was given"
   - Agent omitted: The angels give the records. The passive emphasizes that the person RECEIVES the book -- they have no control over which hand receives it.

4. **يُحَاسَبُ** (yuhasabu, v. 8) -- Form III passive from ح-س-ب
   - Meaning: "he will be held to account"
   - Agent omitted: Allah holds to account. The passive makes the accounting feel like an INEVITABLE process rather than a personal confrontation.

5. **قُرِئَ** (quri'a, v. 21) -- Form I passive from ق-ر-أ
   - Meaning: "it was recited"
   - Agent omitted: The reciter (Prophet or others) is removed. The passive elevates the QURAN ITSELF as the focus -- the disbelievers reject the divine word regardless of who delivers it.

**Theological Significance:**
The consistent use of passive voice across these verses creates a theological pattern: divine agency is present but unnamed. This serves three purposes: (1) it emphasizes the EVENTS and their inevitability over the actor; (2) it creates awe by presenting cosmic transformations as simply happening, without visible cause; (3) it reinforces tawhid subtly -- the reader understands that only Allah could be the unnamed agent of these vast actions, making explicit naming unnecessary and the implication even more powerful.
