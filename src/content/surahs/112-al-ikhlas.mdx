# Al-Ikhlas (The Sincerity)

## Overview

- **Revelation:** Meccan
- **Verses:** 4
- **Theme:** Pure monotheism (tawhid), declaring the absolute oneness and unique nature of Allah, negating any partnership, comparison, or genealogy.
- **Grammar Focus:** Imperative verbs (قُلْ), nominal sentences (jumlah ismiyyah), negation with لَمْ, active participles, demonstrative pronouns, emphasis with هُوَ

## Verse-by-Verse Analysis

### Verse 1

**Arabic:** قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ

**Translation:** "Say: He is Allah, [the] One"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | قُلْ | qul | ق و ل | Verb - Form I, imperative, 2nd person masculine singular | Command verb (fi'l amr) - mabni | Say |
| 2 | هُوَ | huwa | - | Pronoun - detached, 3rd person masculine singular | Subject (mubtada') or pronoun of separation (ḍamīr al-faṣl) - nominative (marfū') | He |
| 3 | اللَّهُ | Allāhu | - | Proper noun - definite | Subject (mubtada') or predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfū') | Allah |
| 4 | أَحَدٌ | aḥadun | - | Noun/adjective - masculine singular, indefinite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfū') | One, unique |

#### Grammar Notes
- قُلْ is the imperative form commanding the Prophet (and by extension, believers) to proclaim.
- This can be analyzed as a nominal sentence in two ways:
  1. هُوَ (subject) + اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ (compound predicate)
  2. اللَّهُ (subject) + أَحَدٌ (predicate), with هُوَ as pronoun of separation (ḍamīr al-faṣl) for emphasis
- أَحَدٌ emphasizes absolute, indivisible oneness (different from وَاحِد which can mean "one of many").
- The entire verse is a declarative statement of pure monotheism.

### Verse 2

**Arabic:** اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ

**Translation:** "Allah, the Eternal Refuge"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | اللَّهُ | Allāhu | - | Proper noun - definite | Subject (mubtada') - nominative (marfū') | Allah |
| 2 | الصَّمَدُ | al-ṣamadu | ص م د | Noun/adjective - masculine singular, definite | Predicate (khabar) - nominative (marfū') | The Eternal, The Absolute, The Self-Sufficient, The Refuge |

#### Grammar Notes
- This is a simple nominal sentence: subject + predicate.
- الصَّمَدُ is a unique attribute of Allah with rich meanings: the one who is eternal, self-sufficient, upon whom all depend, who needs nothing.
- The definite article الـ emphasizes the exclusivity of this attribute to Allah alone.
- The verse continues and amplifies the description begun in verse 1.

### Verse 3

**Arabic:** لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ

**Translation:** "He neither begets nor is born"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | لَمْ | lam | - | Particle - negation and jussive | Negative particle (ḥarf nafy wa-jazm) - mabni | Not, did not |
| 2 | يَلِدْ | yalid | و ل د | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Present tense verb in jussive mood (fi'l muḍāri' majzūm) due to لَمْ | He begets |
| 3 | وَلَمْ | wa-lam | - | Conjunction + particle - negation and jussive | Coordinating conjunction + negative particle - mabni | And not, and did not |
| 4 | يُولَدْ | yūlad | و ل د | Verb - Form I passive, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular | Present tense passive verb in jussive mood (fi'l muḍāri' majzūm mabni li-l-majhūl) due to لَمْ | He is born |

#### Grammar Notes
- لَمْ is the negation particle for present tense that places the verb in the jussive mood (majzūm).
- يَلِدْ is in the jussive mood, indicated by the sukūn (absence of final vowel).
- The first verb is active voice: "He does not beget" (negating offspring).
- يُولَدْ is the passive voice of the same root: "He is not born/begotten" (negating being born).
- Together they negate both directions of genealogy, affirming Allah's eternal existence independent of origin or progeny.
- The parallel structure (لَمْ... وَلَمْ) creates balance and emphasis.

### Verse 4

**Arabic:** وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ

**Translation:** "And there is none comparable to Him"

#### Word-by-Word Breakdown

| # | Arabic | Transliteration | Root | Morphology | I'rab | Meaning |
|---|--------|----------------|------|------------|-------|---------|
| 1 | وَلَمْ | wa-lam | - | Conjunction + particle - negation and jussive | Coordinating conjunction + negative particle - mabni | And not |
| 2 | يَكُن | yakun | ك و ن | Verb - Form I, present tense, 3rd person masculine singular (defective verb) | Defective verb in jussive mood (kāna majzūm) - mabni | There is, there was |
| 3 | لَّهُ | lahu | - | Preposition + attached pronoun 3rd person masculine singular | Preposition + pronoun acting as predicate (khabar kāna muqaddam) - mabni | For Him, to Him |
| 4 | كُفُوًا | kufuwan | ك ف و | Noun/adjective - masculine singular, indefinite | Circumstantial description (ḥāl) - accusative (manṣūb) | Equivalent, equal, comparable |
| 5 | أَحَدٌ | aḥadun | - | Noun/pronoun - indefinite | Subject of kāna (ism kāna mu'akhkhar) - nominative (marfū') | Anyone, none |

#### Grammar Notes
- لَمْ negates يَكُن, placing it in the jussive mood.
- يَكُن is a defective verb (kāna wa-akhawātuhā) that requires a subject (ism kāna) and predicate (khabar kāna).
- The word order is inverted: predicate (لَّهُ) comes before subject (أَحَدٌ).
- أَحَدٌ is the subject of كَانَ, so it's in the nominative case despite the negation.
- لَّهُ is the predicate of كَانَ in the form of a prepositional phrase.
- كُفُوًا is in the accusative as a ḥāl (circumstantial state), describing the condition ("as an equivalent").
- The verse completes the negation: no offspring, no origin, and no equal or partner.
