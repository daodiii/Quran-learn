## Introduction

Surah Al-Ikhlas is described in hadith as "equal to a third of the Quran" in meaning. Four verses — just 15 words — contain the complete statement of tawhid (monotheism). Every grammatical choice amplifies this theological message.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ﴿١﴾ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ ﴿٢﴾ لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ ﴿٣﴾ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ ﴿٤﴾"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun · allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu · lam yalid wa-lam yūlad · wa-lam yakun lahu kufuwan aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, [the] One. Allah, the Eternal Refuge. He neither begets nor is born, nor is there to Him any equivalent."
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1-4"
  highlight="أَحَدٌ"
/>

Al-Ikhlas was previously used for examples in Level 1 and Level 2 lessons. Now you will analyze the ENTIRE surah, seeing how individual grammatical features you learned earlier work together to create a unified theological statement.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Apply the 5-step full i'rab analysis method to all 4 verses of Al-Ikhlas
- Analyze how grammatical structures express tawhid theology
- Recognize negation patterns and their theological precision
- Understand word order inversion (taqdim) and ring composition
- Synthesize nahw, sarf, and balagha levels in complete surah analysis

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L5.01 Full I'rab Analysis](/learn/level-5/01-full-irab-analysis), you learned the 5-step method for complete verse analysis. In [L5.02 Al-Fatiha Analysis](/learn/level-5/02-surah-al-fatiha), you applied this method to a longer surah (7 verses). Now apply it to Al-Ikhlas — shorter in length but deeper in theological concentration.

<Callout type="insight" title="From Examples to Complete Analysis">
You've seen individual verses from Al-Ikhlas in [L2.01 Nominal Sentences](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence) and other lessons. Those were isolated examples. This lesson reveals how all four verses form an integrated grammatical and theological whole.
</Callout>

## Surah Overview

Surah Al-Ikhlas consists of 4 verses, 15 words, and presents a pure theological statement of Allah's absolute uniqueness. The surah divides into two structural halves:

- **Verses 1-2:** Affirmation — who Allah IS
- **Verses 3-4:** Negation — who Allah is NOT

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Sentence Type | Key Grammar | Theological Message |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|
| 1 | قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ | Imperative + Nominal | Pronoun debate, أَحَدٌ vs وَاحِدٌ | Absolute oneness |
| 2 | ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ | Nominal (equation) | Both definite | Self-sufficiency |
| 3 | لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ | Verbal (negative) | Jussive, active/passive | No lineage |
| 4 | وَلَمْ يَكُنْْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ | Verbal (negative) | Kaana, taqdim | No equal |
</GrammarTable>

This overview gives you the structural map. Now we'll analyze each verse in detail.

## Verse 1: قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, [the] One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
/>

### Word-by-Word I'rab

**قُلْ** (qul)
- **Function:** Imperative verb
- **Root:** ق-و-ل (q-w-l), "to say"
- **Form:** Form I imperative, 2nd person masculine singular
- **Analysis:** Hollow verb (second radical is و), shortened in imperative to قُلْ
- **Context:** Command addressed to the Prophet (peace be upon him)

**هُوَ** (huwa)
- **Function:** Subject (mubtadaʾ) OR pronoun of affair (ḍamīr al-sha'n)
- **Case:** Nominative (maḥall rafʿ) — pronouns have inherent case placement
- **Analysis:** 3rd person masculine singular pronoun
- **Scholarly debate:** Is this a standard subject, or is it ḍamīr al-sha'n (a pronoun introducing a significant statement)?

<Callout type="advanced" title="Scholarly Debate: Ḍamīr al-Sha'n">
Classical grammarians debate the exact function of هُوَ:

**View 1:** Standard mubtadaʾ, with ٱللَّهُ as first khabar and أَحَدٌ as second khabar (multiple predicates).

**View 2:** Ḍamīr al-sha'n (pronoun of affair), where the entire clause ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ functions as khabar. This reading emphasizes the momentousness of the statement: "The matter is: Allah is One."

Both readings are grammatically valid. The ḍamīr al-sha'n reading adds rhetorical weight, which many scholars prefer given the surah's theological significance.
</Callout>

**ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu)
- **Function:** Predicate (khabar) OR second subject (mubtadaʾ thānī)
- **Case:** Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
- **Analysis:** The proper name of Allah, definite by nature
- **Pattern:** No pattern — proper noun

**أَحَدٌ** (aḥadun)
- **Function:** Second predicate (khabar)
- **Case:** Nominative (rafʿ), marked by tanwin damm
- **Root:** أ-ح-د (ʾ-ḥ-d), "one, unique"
- **Pattern:** فَعَلٌ (faʿalun)
- **Analysis:** Indefinite — crucial for theological meaning

### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (syntax):** The clause هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ is a nominal sentence embedded within the imperative command. All three nouns/pronouns take nominative case.

**Sarf (morphology):** The imperative قُلْ demonstrates hollow verb behavior (و drops in imperative). The word أَحَدٌ is indefinite, contrasting with the definite ٱللَّهُ.

**Balagha (rhetoric):** Why أَحَدٌ (aḥad) instead of وَاحِدٌ (wāḥid)?
- **أَحَدٌ** emphasizes absolute uniqueness, unrepeatable singularity
- **وَاحِدٌ** means numerical one (one of a kind, but kind exists)
- The choice of أَحَدٌ asserts that Allah is not just "one god among potential gods" but uniquely ONE in a category of His own

The indefiniteness also serves emphasis: it's not about identifying WHICH one (definite), but asserting the CONCEPT of absolute oneness (indefinite for amplification).

## Verse 2: ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="Allah, the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="ٱلصَّمَدُ"
/>

### Word-by-Word I'rab

**ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu)
- **Function:** Subject (mubtadaʾ)
- **Case:** Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
- **Analysis:** Proper name, definite by nature
- **Context:** Second occurrence in the surah — repetition for emphasis

**ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu)
- **Function:** Predicate (khabar)
- **Case:** Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
- **Root:** ص-م-د (ṣ-m-d), "to be solid, to be eternal, to be the goal"
- **Pattern:** فَعَلُ (faʿalu) — intensive/exaggerated quality pattern
- **Meaning:** The Eternal Refuge, the One upon whom all depend, who depends on none
- **Definite:** Marked by ال (al-) — identification, not description

### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (syntax):** This is an equation sentence (jumlah muʿādilah) — both mubtadaʾ and khabar are definite. Structure: "Allah = The Eternal Refuge." This is not description but identification.

**Sarf (morphology):** The root ص-م-د carries meanings of solidity, permanence, and being the ultimate recourse. The pattern فَعَلُ often indicates intensive qualities.

**Balagha (rhetoric):** Both words are definite (ال on both). This creates an equation: Allah IS the Eternal Refuge (not just "an eternal refuge"). The definiteness asserts exclusivity — there is no other ṣamad but Allah.

The conciseness is striking: a complete theological concept in just two words, each definite, each essential.

## Verse 3: لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ"
  transliteration="lam yalid wa-lam yūlad"
  translation="He neither begets nor is born"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:3"
  highlight="لَمْ"
/>

### Word-by-Word I'rab

**لَمْ** (lam)
- **Function:** Negation particle for past tense
- **Effect:** Causes jussive mood (jazm) on following verb
- **Meaning:** Past negation using present form verb

**يَلِدْ** (yalid)
- **Function:** Verb in jussive mood
- **Root:** و-ل-د (w-l-d), "to give birth, to beget"
- **Form:** Form I present tense, jussive (majzūm)
- **Person:** 3rd person masculine singular
- **Mood marker:** Sukun on final radical (يَلِدْ) indicating jazm
- **Voice:** Active
- **Subject:** Hidden pronoun (huwa) referring to Allah

**وَ** (wa-)
- **Function:** Coordinating conjunction
- **Meaning:** "and"
- **Context:** Joins two parallel negative statements

**لَمْ** (lam)
- **Function:** Second negation particle (repeated structure)
- **Effect:** Causes jussive mood on following verb

**يُولَدْ** (yūlad)
- **Function:** Verb in jussive mood
- **Root:** و-ل-د (w-l-d), same root as يَلِدْ
- **Form:** Form I present tense, jussive (majzūm)
- **Person:** 3rd person masculine singular
- **Mood marker:** Sukun on final radical (يُولَدْ) indicating jazm
- **Voice:** PASSIVE (contrast with active يَلِدْ)
- **Pattern:** يُفْعَلُ passive pattern
- **Subject (deputy):** Hidden pronoun (huwa) referring to Allah

### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (syntax):** Two parallel negative verbal sentences joined by وَ. Both verbs take jussive mood (jazm) due to لَمْ. The parallelism (لَمْ... وَلَمْ...) creates rhythmic balance.

**Sarf (morphology):** Same root و-ل-د used in active voice (يَلِدْ) then passive voice (يُولَدْ). This morphological contrast (active/passive) negates the concept from BOTH directions.

**Balagha (rhetoric):** Why use لَمْ with present-form verbs for past meaning instead of simple past negation مَا وَلَدَ?

The choice of لَمْ + present form gives ETERNAL past negation — not just "He didn't beget at some point" but "He has never and will never beget." The present form with past meaning indicates timeless negation.

The active-then-passive sequence is deliberate:
1. **لَمْ يَلِدْ** — He is not a father (active: no offspring from Him)
2. **لَمْ يُولَدْ** — He is not a son (passive: no parent produced Him)

Together, these negate lineage completely: no generation forward, no generation backward.

<Callout type="insight" title="Connection to L4.10 Negation">
In [L4.10 Negation Particles](/learn/level-4/10-negation-particles), you learned that لَمْ is unique among negation particles — it uses PRESENT verb form with PAST meaning. Here you see this principle in action: لَمْ يَلِدْ uses present form يَلِدْ to express eternal past negation.
</Callout>

## Verse 4: وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="wa-lam yakun lahu kufuwan aḥadun"
  translation="Nor is there to Him any equivalent"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:4"
  highlight="كُفُوًا"
/>

### Word-by-Word I'rab

**وَ** (wa-)
- **Function:** Coordinating conjunction
- **Meaning:** "and, nor"
- **Context:** Continues the negation sequence from verse 3

**لَمْ** (lam)
- **Function:** Negation particle causing jussive mood
- **Context:** Third occurrence of لَمْ in the surah (structural pattern)

**يَكُنْ** (yakun)
- **Function:** Verb in jussive mood, "to be"
- **Root:** ك-و-ن (k-w-n)
- **Form:** Form I present tense, jussive (majzūm)
- **Full form:** يَكُونُ (yakūnu) in indicative mood
- **Jussive form:** يَكُنْْ (yakun) — hollow verb shortens by dropping long vowel
- **Category:** Kaana and her sisters (incomplete/defective verb - نَاقِصَةٌ)
- **Effect:** Takes a subject (ism) in nominative and predicate (khabar) in accusative

**لَّهُ** (lahu)
- **Function:** Predicate of kaana (khabar kaana), FRONTED for emphasis
- **Form:** لِ (preposition) + هُ (pronoun suffix)
- **Case location:** Jarr wa-majrur (prepositional phrase) in maḥall naṣb (accusative position as khabar)
- **Meaning:** "to Him, for Him"

**كُفُوًا** (kufuwan)
- **Function:** Second predicate OR ḥāl (circumstantial descriptor) OR tamyīz (specification)
- **Case:** Accusative (naṣb), marked by tanwin fatḥ
- **Root:** ك-ف-ء (k-f-ʾ), "to be equal, equivalent"
- **Pattern:** فُعُلٌ (fuʿulun) or فَعُولٌ (faʿūlun)
- **Meaning:** "equal, equivalent, match"

**أَحَدٌ** (aḥadun)
- **Function:** Subject of kaana (ism kaana), DELAYED
- **Case:** Nominative (rafʿ), marked by tanwin damm
- **Root:** أ-ح-د (ʾ-ḥ-d), "one, anyone"
- **Analysis:** Indefinite — "anyone at all"
- **Echo:** Same word that closed Verse 1 — ring composition

### Nahw-Sarf-Balagha Synthesis

**Nahw (syntax):** This sentence features kaana (كَانَ), one of the incomplete verbs you learned in [L2.10 Kaana and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters). The normal word order would be:

- **Standard order:** لَمْ يَكُنْْ أَحَدٌ كُفُوًا لَهُ
  - يَكُنْْ (verb) + أَحَدٌ (subject/ism) + كُفُوًا (predicate) + لَهُ (to Him)

But the actual verse inverts this to:

- **Actual order:** وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ
  - يَكُنْْ (verb) + لَهُ (fronted predicate) + كُفُوًا (circumstantial) + أَحَدٌ (delayed subject)

This is **taqdīm wa-ta'khīr** (advancement and delay) — word order inversion for rhetorical effect.

**Sarf (morphology):** The verb يَكُنْ shows hollow verb behavior in jussive — the long vowel ū drops, shortening يَكُونُ to يَكُنْْ. The word كُفُوًا is accusative, functioning as part of the predicate structure.

**Balagha (rhetoric):** The word order inversion (taqdīm) serves multiple rhetorical purposes:

1. **لَهُ fronted** — Emphasizes "to HIM" (exclusivity: we're talking specifically about Allah, no other)
2. **أَحَدٌ delayed** — Creates suspense and finality. The listener hears "There is not to Him equivalent..." and waits for WHO/WHAT, then the answer comes: "anyone" (أَحَدٌ) — absolute negation
3. **Ring composition** — The word أَحَدٌ appears at the END of Verse 1 and END of Verse 4, creating a ring structure that bookends the surah's core message

The delayed subject أَحَدٌ echoes the delayed أَحَدٌ in Verse 1, reinforcing the message: He is absolutely One, and there is absolutely no one equivalent to Him.

<Callout type="insight" title="Taqdim as Theological Tool">
The fronting of لَهُ (to Him) before the predicate isn't just stylistic — it's theological. By placing "to Him" first, the verse establishes the exclusive focus on Allah before even stating what is being negated. The structure itself mirrors the tawhid message: ALLAH first, then everything else.
</Callout>

## Surah-Level Synthesis

Now that we've analyzed each verse individually, let's examine how they work together as a unified whole.

### Ring Composition: أَحَدٌ Bookends

The surah opens and closes with the word أَحَدٌ:
- **Verse 1:** ...ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ("Allah is One")
- **Verse 4:** ...كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ ("any equivalent")

This creates a ring composition (inclusio) that frames the entire surah within the concept of absolute oneness. Everything between these two occurrences explains and reinforces this central truth.

### Affirmation-Negation Structure

<GrammarTable>
| Section | Verses | Approach | Grammar | Message |
|---------|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Affirmation** | 1-2 | Positive statements | Nominal sentences | Who Allah IS |
| **Negation** | 3-4 | Negative statements | Verbal sentences with لَمْ | Who Allah is NOT |
</GrammarTable>

The surah first establishes positive identity (أَحَدٌ, ٱلصَّمَدُ), then negates false conceptions (not begetting, not begotten, no equal). This two-part structure is both grammatically and logically complete.

### Grammar Serving Tawhid

Every grammatical choice amplifies the theological message:

1. **أَحَدٌ not وَاحِدٌ** (Verse 1) — absolute uniqueness, not numerical oneness
2. **Both definite** (Verse 2) — equation, not description (Allah = The Eternal Refuge)
3. **لَمْ with present form** (Verses 3-4) — eternal negation, not historical
4. **Active then passive** (Verse 3) — negation from both directions
5. **Taqdīm** (Verse 4) — "to HIM" emphasized before stating "no equivalent"
6. **Ring composition** — أَحَدٌ frames the entire message

### Comparison with Al-Fatiha

In [L5.02 Al-Fatiha Analysis](/learn/level-5/02-surah-al-fatiha), you analyzed a longer surah with varied sentence types. Al-Ikhlas provides a different model:

- **Al-Fatiha:** 7 verses, multiple sentence types, progressive structure (praise → guidance → supplication)
- **Al-Ikhlas:** 4 verses, binary structure (affirmation → negation), theological concentration

Both demonstrate complete i'rab analysis, but Al-Ikhlas shows how BREVITY can be as powerful as EXPANSION when every grammatical element is precisely calibrated.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 1: Verb Analysis (Guided)">

**Task:** Analyze the two jussive verbs in Verse 3: **يَلِدْ** and **يُولَدْ**.

For each verb, identify:
1. Root (three letters)
2. Form number
3. Voice (active or passive)
4. Mood and mood marker
5. Why the voice changes between these two verbs

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**يَلِدْ (yalid):**
1. Root: و-ل-د (w-l-d)
2. Form: Form I
3. Voice: Active
4. Mood: Jussive (majzūm), marked by sukun on the final letter (يَلِدْ)
5. Meaning: "He begets/gives birth" (active — the subject performs the action)

**يُولَدْ (yūlad):**
1. Root: و-ل-د (w-l-d) — same root
2. Form: Form I passive
3. Voice: Passive
4. Mood: Jussive (majzūm), marked by sukun on the final letter (يُولَدْ)
5. Meaning: "He is born" (passive — the subject receives the action)

**Why voice changes:**
The verse negates lineage from BOTH directions:
- Active voice (يَلِدْ) negates forward lineage: Allah has no offspring
- Passive voice (يُولَدْ) negates backward lineage: Allah has no parent

Using both voices in parallel creates complete negation — no generation in either direction.

</details>
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 2: Taqdim Analysis (Intermediate)">

**Task:** Verse 4 uses word order inversion (taqdīm wa-ta'khīr).

1. Write out the standard (uninverted) word order
2. Write out the actual word order in the verse
3. Identify what was fronted (muqaddam) and what was delayed (mu'akhkhar)
4. Explain the rhetorical effect of this inversion

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**1. Standard word order:**
لَمْ يَكُنْْ أَحَدٌ كُفُوًا لَهُ

- لَمْ (negation) + يَكُنْْ (verb) + أَحَدٌ (subject/ism) + كُفُوًا (predicate) + لَهُ (to Him)

**2. Actual word order:**
وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ

- وَ (conjunction) + لَمْ (negation) + يَكُنْْ (verb) + لَهُ (fronted) + كُفُوًا (predicate) + أَحَدٌ (delayed subject)

**3. What moved:**
- **Fronted (muqaddam):** لَهُ (to Him) — moved from end to immediately after the verb
- **Delayed (mu'akhkhar):** أَحَدٌ (anyone) — moved from immediately after verb to end of sentence

**4. Rhetorical effect:**
- **Emphasis on exclusivity:** By fronting لَهُ (to Him), the verse emphasizes that we're talking specifically about ALLAH — establishing the exclusive focus before stating what is negated
- **Suspense and finality:** Delaying the subject أَحَدٌ creates anticipation. The listener hears "There is not to Him equivalent..." and waits for the answer, which comes with emphatic finality: "anyone/no one" (أَحَدٌ)
- **Ring composition:** Placing أَحَدٌ at the end of Verse 4 echoes its position at the end of Verse 1, framing the surah's message of absolute oneness

The inversion transforms a simple negation into a powerful theological statement.

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 3: Definiteness Patterns (Intermediate)">

**Task:** Track definiteness across all 4 verses of Al-Ikhlas.

1. Identify which nouns are definite and which are indefinite
2. Explain why أَحَدٌ is indefinite in Verse 1 but ٱلصَّمَدُ is definite in Verse 2
3. What rhetorical purpose does each definiteness pattern serve?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**1. Definiteness tracking:**

**Verse 1:** قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
- هُوَ: definite (pronoun)
- ٱللَّهُ: definite (proper name)
- أَحَدٌ: **indefinite** (no ال, has tanwin)

**Verse 2:** ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ
- ٱللَّهُ: definite (proper name)
- ٱلصَّمَدُ: **definite** (has ال)

**Verse 3:** لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ
- No nouns (only verbs)

**Verse 4:** وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ
- لَهُ: definite (pronoun)
- كُفُوًا: **indefinite** (tanwin)
- أَحَدٌ: **indefinite** (tanwin)

**2. Why indefinite vs. definite:**

**أَحَدٌ (indefinite in V1):**
- Emphasizes the CONCEPT of oneness, not the IDENTITY of a specific one
- Indefiniteness here serves amplification — absolute, unrepeatable uniqueness
- Not "Allah is THE one" (implying "the one among many") but "Allah is ONE" (in an absolute, incomparable sense)

**ٱلصَّمَدُ (definite in V2):**
- Both subject and predicate are definite — creates equation sentence
- "Allah = THE Eternal Refuge" (identification, not description)
- Definiteness asserts exclusivity — there is no other ṣamad but Allah
- This is not "Allah is an eternal refuge" but "Allah IS the Eternal Refuge"

**3. Rhetorical purposes:**

- **Indefinite أَحَدٌ:** Emphasizes concept over identity, absolute uniqueness over numerical counting
- **Definite ٱلصَّمَدُ:** Creates exclusive equation, asserts that only Allah has this attribute
- **Indefinite كُفُوًا and أَحَدٌ (V4):** Universal negation — "not anyone, not anything" (indefiniteness = generality)

Each definiteness choice reinforces the tawhid message through grammatical precision.

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 4: Complete Analysis (Advanced)">

**Task:** Perform a full 5-step i'rab analysis of Verse 2 using the method from [L5.01](/learn/level-5/01-full-irab-analysis).

**Verse 2:** ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ

Include:
- Step 1: Word-by-word function and case
- Step 2: Sarf analysis (roots, patterns)
- Step 3: Sentence type and structure
- Step 4: Balagha (rhetorical features)
- Step 5: Context and theological significance

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Step 1: Word-by-word nahw (syntax)**

**ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu)
- Function: Subject (mubtadaʾ)
- Case: Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
- Analysis: Proper name, definite by nature
- Subject of the nominal sentence

**ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu)
- Function: Predicate (khabar)
- Case: Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
- Analysis: Noun, definite (marked by ال)
- Predicate of the nominal sentence

**Step 2: Sarf (morphology)**

**ٱللَّهُ:**
- Not derived from a trilateral root — proper name of Allah
- Some linguists suggest connection to أَلَهَ (to worship), but this is debated
- Unique form, no pattern application

**ٱلصَّمَدُ:**
- Root: ص-م-د (ṣ-m-d)
- Pattern: فَعَلُ (faʿalu)
- Meaning: solid, eternal, the one to whom all turn in need, self-sufficient
- Form: Noun of exaggerated quality or intensive attribute

**Step 3: Sentence type and structure**

- **Type:** Nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah)
- **Structure:** Mubtadaʾ + khabar
- **Both definite:** This creates an equation sentence (jumlah muʿādilah)
- **Meaning of equation:** "Allah = The Eternal Refuge" (identification, not mere description)

**Step 4: Balagha (rhetorical features)**

1. **Equation through double definiteness:** Both ٱللَّهُ and ٱلصَّمَدُ are definite, creating a statement of identification rather than description. This is not "Allah has the quality of being eternal" but rather "Allah IS the Eternal Refuge" — absolute equation.

2. **Exclusivity:** The definiteness of ٱلصَّمَدُ (with ال) indicates that there is only ONE who is truly ṣamad — Allah. No one else can claim this attribute.

3. **Brevity and density:** Two words convey a complete theological concept. The conciseness itself is rhetorical — no elaboration needed, the truth is self-evident.

4. **Rhythm and sound:** The verse is just two words, both ending in u-sound (allāhu, aṣ-ṣamadu), creating phonetic unity and completeness.

**Step 5: Context and theological significance**

- **Position in surah:** Verse 2 is the second affirmative statement, following "Allah is One" with "Allah is the Eternal Refuge."
- **Theological meaning of ṣamad:** Self-sufficient, needing nothing, upon whom all depend, solid (no internal parts or composition)
- **Connection to tawhid:** After asserting oneness (أَحَدٌ), the verse explains the nature of that oneness — not just numerical unity but absolute self-sufficiency and completeness
- **Prepares for negations:** The concept of ṣamad (needing nothing, self-complete) prepares for Verses 3-4, which negate any need for lineage or equivalents

**Synthesis:** This verse encapsulates the positive aspect of tawhid — Allah's absolute self-sufficiency. The grammatical equation (both nouns definite) mirrors the theological truth: there is complete identification between Allah and eternal self-sufficiency.
