## Introduction

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ"
  transliteration="fa-bi-ayyi ālāʾi rabbikumā tukadhdhibān"
  translation="So which of the favors of your Lord would you two deny?"
  reference="Ar-Rahman 55:13"
  highlight="فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ"
/>

This verse appears **31 times** in Surah Ar-Rahman. Not 2 times. Not 5 times. THIRTY-ONE times. Why would the Quran repeat an identical verse so many times? Because repetition in the Quran is never redundancy — it's EMPHASIS. And that emphasis is built on precise grammatical structures.

You've analyzed individual verse grammar and cross-surah patterns. Now examine a rhetorical superpower: **parallel structures** (تَوَازٍ / tawāzin). When the Quran repeats a grammatical pattern — whether within a single verse or across an entire surah — the grammar serves a specific rhetorical purpose.

**In this lesson, you will:**
1. Identify parallel grammatical structures as rhetorical emphasis devices
2. Analyze Surah Ar-Rahman's refrain as a parallelism case study
3. Classify three types of repetition and their grammatical functions
4. Compare refrain patterns across multiple surahs

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.16 Introduction to Balagha](/learn/level-4/intro-balagha) and [L4.17 Figures of Speech](/learn/level-4/figures-of-speech), you learned that Arabic rhetoric uses grammar strategically. In [L5.06](/learn/level-5/juz-amma-patterns), you identified patterns across surahs. This lesson begins the applied rhetoric section (L5.12-14), where you'll see how grammar choices CREATE emphasis, not just describe it.

<Callout type="tip" title="Three Types of Parallelism">

The Quran uses three distinct parallelism types, each with different grammatical structures:
1. **Structural parallelism** — Same grammatical pattern, different content
2. **Refrain repetition** — Identical verse repeated at intervals
3. **Antithetical parallelism** — Parallel structures expressing opposites

Recognizing which type you're reading helps you understand WHY it's being used.

</Callout>

## Type 1: Structural Parallelism (Grammatical Mirroring)

Structural parallelism occurs when the same grammatical pattern is applied to different content — like a template filled with different words.

### Example: Ar-Rahman 55:1-4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ ﴿١﴾ عَلَّمَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ ﴿٢﴾ خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ ﴿٣﴾ عَلَّمَهُ ٱلْبَيَانَ ﴿٤﴾"
  translation="The Most Merciful (1) Taught the Quran (2) Created humankind (3) Taught him eloquence (4)"
  reference="Ar-Rahman 55:1-4"
  highlight="عَلَّمَ"
/>

**Parallel structure analysis:**

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Arabic | Structure | Subject | Verb | Object |
|-------|--------|-----------|---------|------|--------|
| V1 | ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ | Nominal (mubtada) | ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ | — | — |
| V2 | عَلَّمَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ | Verbal (khabar) | (implied) | عَلَّمَ (Form II) | ٱلْقُرْآنَ |
| V3 | خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ | Verbal (parallel) | (implied) | خَلَقَ (Form I) | ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ |
| V4 | عَلَّمَهُ ٱلْبَيَانَ | Verbal (parallel) | (implied) | عَلَّمَهُ (Form II) | ٱلْبَيَانَ |
</GrammarTable>

**What makes this parallel:**
- Verses 2-4 share the same structure: **Past tense verb + Accusative object**
- The implied subject for ALL three verbs is ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ (V1)
- The pattern connects ALL actions to a single agent — Allah's mercy encompasses teaching, creating, and giving speech

**Rhetorical effect:** By using the same verb+object pattern three times, the grammar creates a LIST effect. Each item is grammatically equal, suggesting these divine actions are equally important. The parallelism makes the reader expect MORE items — building anticipation.

### Example: Al-Balad 90:8-10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَلَمْ نَجْعَل لَّهُ عَيْنَيْنِ ﴿٨﴾ وَلِسَانًا وَشَفَتَيْنِ ﴿٩﴾ وَهَدَيْنَاهُ ٱلنَّجْدَيْنِ ﴿١٠﴾"
  translation="Did We not make for him two eyes (8) And a tongue and two lips (9) And guided him to the two ways (10)"
  reference="Al-Balad 90:8-10"
/>

**Parallel structure:** أَلَمْ نَجْعَل (rhetorical question + first-person plural + jussive) governs all three verses. The conjunction وَ chains parallel objects in accusative case: عَيْنَيْنِ (dual), لِسَانًا (singular), شَفَتَيْنِ (dual). Each is a divine gift — the parallel grammar creates equivalence.

## Type 2: Refrain Repetition (تَكْرَار)

A refrain (تَكْرَارٌ / takrār) is an identical verse repeated at intervals, creating a structural rhythm across the surah.

### Focused Study: Surah Ar-Rahman's Refrain

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ"
  translation="So which of the favors of your Lord would you two deny?"
  reference="Ar-Rahman 55:13"
/>

**Complete word-by-word i'rab:**

**فَ** (fa):
- Function: Connective particle (فَاءُ ٱلْعَطْفِ or فَاءُ ٱلٱسْتِئْنَافِيَّةُ — resumptive fa)
- Effect: Links this verse to the preceding blessing — "given THAT blessing, which favors do you deny?"

**بِ** (bi):
- Function: [Preposition](/resources/glossary#harf-jarr) (حَرْفُ جَرٍّ)
- Governs: The following noun takes genitive case

**أَيِّ** (ayyi):
- Function: Interrogative adjective (اِسْمُ ٱسْتِفْهَامٍ / ism al-istifhām — "which?")
- Case: Genitive (مَجْرُورٌ) — governed by the preposition بِ
- This is NOT a genuine question but a rhetorical question (اِسْتِفْهَامٌ إِنْكَارِيٌّ — denial/rebuke type). See [L5.13 Rhetorical Questions](/learn/level-5/rhetorical-questions)

**آلَاءِ** (ālāʾi):
- Function: [Muḍāf ilayh](/resources/glossary#mudaf-ilayh) (مُضَافٌ إِلَيْهِ) to أَيِّ — "which OF THE favors"
- Case: Genitive (مَجْرُورٌ) — second term of idafah is always genitive
- Root: أ-ل-و (or أ-ل-ي). Plural of أَلَاءٌ meaning "blessing, favor, bounty"
- Note: This plural form is rare and archaic — its unfamiliarity adds rhetorical weight

**رَبِّكُمَا** (rabbikumā):
- Function: Muḍāf ilayh to آلَاءِ — "favors OF YOUR LORD"
- Case: Genitive (chain continues from آلَاءِ)
- Structure: رَبِّ (muḍāf — Lord) + كُمَا (attached **dual** pronoun — "your," addressing TWO groups)
- **Critical grammar point:** The dual pronoun كُمَا addresses both **jinn and humans** simultaneously — the entire surah's audience

**تُكَذِّبَانِ** (tukadhdhibāni):
- Function: Main verb of the sentence
- Form: **Form II** (فَعَّلَ / faʿʿala) — intensive/emphatic pattern. Root: ك-ذ-ب
- Tense: Present tense, indicative mood (مَرْفُوعٌ)
- Person: Second-person **dual** (تُفَعِّلَانِ pattern)
- **Why Form II?** Form I كَذَبَ means "to lie." Form II كَذَّبَ intensifies: "to persistently deny, to call something a lie, to reject emphatically." The Form II pattern emphasizes the SEVERITY of denial
- **Why dual?** The نِ ending marks dual number — addressing TWO groups (jinn and humans) as a pair. This is grammatically consistent with كُمَا above

<Callout type="rule">
**The Grammar of 31 Repetitions:**

Why repeat this verse 31 times? Each repetition follows a SPECIFIC blessing:
- After natural blessings (sun, moon, stars) — Verses 14-16
- After human blessings (creation, speech) — Verses 17-18
- After cosmic blessings (seas, ships) — Verses 19-25
- After eschatological descriptions (judgment, paradise, hellfire) — Verses 26-78

The grammar makes each repetition contextually different even though the WORDS are identical. The فَ (so/then) links each instance to the PRECEDING content, making the meaning "Given THIS specific blessing, which favors do you deny?" The answer each time is: none — you cannot deny any of them.
</Callout>

### How the Refrain Connects to Context

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلشَّمْسُ وَٱلْقَمَرُ بِحُسْبَانٍ ﴿٥﴾ وَٱلنَّجْمُ وَٱلشَّجَرُ يَسْجُدَانِ ﴿٦﴾"
  translation="The sun and the moon by precise calculation (5) And the stars and the trees prostrate (6)"
  reference="Ar-Rahman 55:5-6"
/>

After describing cosmic order (V5-12), the refrain asks: given THESE blessings — celestial precision, vegetation, balanced creation — which do you deny? The refrain's grammar (فَ conjunction) creates a logical chain: blessing → challenge → next blessing → challenge.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن صَلْصَالٍ كَٱلْفَخَّارِ ﴿١٤﴾ وَخَلَقَ ٱلْجَانَّ مِن مَّارِجٍ مِّن نَّارٍ ﴿١٥﴾"
  translation="He created humankind from clay like pottery (14) And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire (15)"
  reference="Ar-Rahman 55:14-15"
/>

After V14-15 (creating humans and jinn), the refrain addresses BOTH created groups — the dual pronoun كُمَا now has explicit antecedents. The grammar links creation to accountability: He created you BOTH → which of His favors do you BOTH deny?

## Type 3: Antithetical Parallelism (Contrasting Pairs)

Antithetical parallelism uses the SAME grammatical structure to express OPPOSITE ideas — creating emphasis through contrast.

### Example: Al-Layl 92:5-10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ وَٱتَّقَىٰ ﴿٥﴾ وَصَدَّقَ بِٱلْحُسْنَىٰ ﴿٦﴾ فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ ﴿٧﴾"
  translation="As for he who gives and fears Allah (5) And believes in the best [reward] (6) We will ease him toward ease (7)"
  reference="Al-Layl 92:5-7"
  highlight="فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ"
/>

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ وَٱسْتَغْنَىٰ ﴿٨﴾ وَكَذَّبَ بِٱلْحُسْنَىٰ ﴿٩﴾ فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ ﴿١٠﴾"
  translation="But as for he who withholds and considers himself free of need (8) And denies the best [reward] (9) We will ease him toward difficulty (10)"
  reference="Al-Layl 92:8-10"
  highlight="وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ"
/>

**Parallel grammar, opposite content:**

<GrammarTable>
| Element | Positive (V5-7) | Negative (V8-10) | Grammar |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|---------|
| Condition | فَأَمَّا مَنْ | وَأَمَّا مَنْ | Identical conditional particle + relative pronoun |
| Action 1 | أَعْطَىٰ (gave) | بَخِلَ (withheld) | Antonyms in same position |
| Action 2 | ٱتَّقَىٰ (feared Allah) | ٱسْتَغْنَىٰ (felt self-sufficient) | Antonyms in same position |
| Belief | صَدَّقَ (believed, Form II) | كَذَّبَ (denied, Form II) | Same verb form, opposite meaning |
| Result | فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْيُسْرَىٰ | فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ لِلْعُسْرَىٰ | Identical structure, one word different |
</GrammarTable>

**Rhetorical power of antithetical parallelism:**
- The grammatical IDENTITY makes the content DIFFERENCE stark
- Same structure, opposite words → the contrast is impossible to miss
- The result clause is almost identical — فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ (We will ease him) — but the destination differs: لِلْيُسْرَىٰ (toward ease) vs. لِلْعُسْرَىٰ (toward difficulty). A single letter changes the meaning entirely

<Callout type="tip">
**Grammar serving theology:** In V7 and V10, the verb يُيَسِّرُ (Form II, root ي-س-ر — to make easy) is used for BOTH outcomes. Even the path to difficulty is described as being "eased" toward it — suggesting that persistent wrong choices make the wrong path feel natural. The grammar creates a disturbing symmetry: ease toward ease AND ease toward hardship.
</Callout>

## Additional Refrain Examples

### Al-Qamar 54: "Ease of Remembrance"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ فَهَلْ مِن مُّدَّكِرٍ"
  translation="And We have certainly made the Quran easy for remembrance, so is there anyone who will remember?"
  reference="Al-Qamar 54:17"
/>

This verse appears **4 times** in Surah Al-Qamar (V17, V22, V32, V40). Each follows the destruction of a disobedient nation (people of Nuh, 'Ad, Thamud, people of Lut).

**Grammar:** وَلَقَدْ (emphatic combination: وَ + لَ + قَدْ) + يَسَّرْنَا (Form II past, majestic plural — "We made easy") + فَهَلْ (result + interrogative — "so is there?") + مِن (partitive) + مُّدَّكِرٍ (Form VIII active participle, root ذ-ك-ر — one who takes heed, genitive after مِن)

**Refrain function:** After each destruction narrative, the refrain asks: given THIS warning, will anyone take heed? Same question, four different contexts.

### Al-Mursilat 77: "Woe to the Deniers"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ"
  translation="Woe, that Day, to the deniers"
  reference="Al-Mursilat 77:15"
/>

This verse appears **10 times** in Surah Al-Mursilat. Each follows a different description of divine power or eschatological event.

**Grammar:** وَيْلٌ (nominative — exclamatory noun, mubtada) + يَوْمَئِذٍ (adverb of time, accusative — "on that day") + لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ (prepositional phrase — لِ + ٱلْمُكَذِّبِينَ, Form II active participle, genitive plural). The khabar is the prepositional phrase لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ.

### Cross-Surah Refrain Comparison

<GrammarTable>
| Surah | Refrain | Repetitions | Grammar Structure | Function |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------------|----------|
| Ar-Rahman (55) | فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ | 31 | Rhetorical question (dual) | Challenges denial after each blessing |
| Al-Qamar (54) | وَلَقَدْ يَسَّرْنَا ٱلْقُرْآنَ لِلذِّكْرِ | 4 | Emphatic declaration + question | Offers remembrance after each destruction |
| Al-Mursilat (77) | وَيْلٌ يَوْمَئِذٍ لِلْمُكَذِّبِينَ | 10 | Exclamatory nominal sentence | Warns after each divine sign |
| Ash-Shu'ara (26) | وَإِنَّ رَبَّكَ لَهُوَ ٱلْعَزِيزُ ٱلرَّحِيمُ | 8 | إِنَّ + emphatic لَ + nominal | Affirms divine nature after each prophet story |
</GrammarTable>

**Shared features:**
1. Every refrain is a grammatically complete sentence
2. Every refrain connects to its surrounding context via فَ or وَ
3. The grammatical form matches the rhetorical function (questions challenge, declarations affirm, exclamations warn)

## Practice

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 1: Refrain Analysis (Guided)">

Parse فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ completely:

1. Identify each word's grammatical function and case
2. Explain the grammatical reason for the dual form (not just "two groups" — explain the morphological markers)
3. Why is كَذَّبَ Form II instead of Form I? What meaning does intensification add?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Word-by-word:**
1. **فَ**: Connective/resumptive particle — links to preceding content
2. **بِ**: Preposition (حَرْفُ جَرٍّ) — governs genitive on following word
3. **أَيِّ**: Interrogative adjective (اِسْمُ اسْتِفْهَامٍ), genitive (مَجْرُورٌ بِالْبَاءِ) — governed by بِ. Functions as muḍāf (first term of idafah)
4. **آلَاءِ**: Muḍāf ilayh, genitive. Plural of أَلَاءٌ (favors/blessings). Itself also muḍāf to رَبِّكُمَا
5. **رَبِّكُمَا**: Muḍāf ilayh to آلَاءِ, genitive. رَبِّ = muḍāf + كُمَا = dual attached pronoun (muḍāf ilayh), genitive
6. **تُكَذِّبَانِ**: Present tense, Form II (تُفَعِّلَانِ pattern), indicative mood (مَرْفُوعٌ بِثُبُوتِ ٱلنُّونِ — raised by retention of نُون), second-person dual

**Dual morphological markers:**
- كُمَا: Attached dual pronoun — ك (second person) + مَا (dual marker, distinct from مَا interrogative/negation)
- تُكَذِّبَانِ: تُ (second-person prefix) + كَذِّبْ (Form II stem) + انِ (dual suffix replacing standard indicative ضَمَّة). The indicative dual is marked by the نُون at the end (نُون ٱلرَّفْعِ)

**Form II vs Form I:**
- Form I كَذَبَ = "to lie, to say something untrue" — a single act of dishonesty
- Form II كَذَّبَ = "to persistently deny, to reject as lies, to call something false" — intensive, repeated action. The doubled middle letter (shadda on ذ) intensifies the meaning
- In context: Form II emphasizes that denying Allah's favors is not a simple mistake but an active, persistent rejection. The intensification makes the rhetorical question MORE challenging — you're not just lying once, you're systematically denying

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 2: Parallelism Type Classification (Intermediate)">

Classify each example as structural, refrain, or antithetical parallelism. Explain your reasoning based on the GRAMMAR (not just content):

(a) Ar-Rahman's 31 repetitions of فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ
(b) Al-Layl's فَأَمَّا مَنْ أَعْطَىٰ / وَأَمَّا مَن بَخِلَ contrasts
(c) Ar-Rahman 55:2-4's عَلَّمَ ٱلْقُرْآنَ / خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ / عَلَّمَهُ ٱلْبَيَانَ

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**(a) Refrain repetition (تَكْرَار):**
- Classification: Refrain — the EXACT same verse repeated 31 times
- Grammar evidence: Identical words, identical parsing, identical sentence structure each time. The فَ connector is the only grammatically variable element (connecting to different preceding content)
- NOT structural parallelism: because the words don't change, only the context does

**(b) Antithetical parallelism:**
- Classification: Antithetical — parallel grammar, opposite content
- Grammar evidence: Identical sentence structure (فَأَمَّا / وَأَمَّا + مَنْ + past tense verb series + فَسَنُيَسِّرُهُ + لِ + superlative). The grammatical TEMPLATE is identical. The content fills opposite slots: أَعْطَىٰ vs. بَخِلَ, صَدَّقَ vs. كَذَّبَ, يُسْرَىٰ vs. عُسْرَىٰ
- NOT refrain: because the words CHANGE. NOT structural: because the content is deliberately CONTRASTING (not just different)

**(c) Structural parallelism:**
- Classification: Structural — same grammatical pattern, different (but non-contrasting) content
- Grammar evidence: All three verses share the pattern: past tense verb + accusative object. The subject (ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ) governs all three. The pattern is: Verb + Object, Verb + Object, Verb + Object
- NOT refrain: because the verses are all different. NOT antithetical: because the three actions (teaching, creating, teaching speech) are complementary, not opposing

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 3: Context Analysis (Intermediate)">

Read Ar-Rahman 55:10-16. What blessings are listed between each refrain occurrence?

For each refrain, explain:
1. What specific blessing PRECEDES this instance of فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ?
2. How does the فَ grammatically connect the refrain to the preceding content?
3. Why is the refrain's meaning DIFFERENT each time despite identical words?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Ar-Rahman 55:10-16 structure:**
- V10: وَٱلْأَرْضَ وَضَعَهَا لِلْأَنَامِ (He laid the earth for creatures)
- V11: فِيهَا فَاكِهَةٌ (in it fruit)
- V12: وَٱلْحَبُّ ذُو ٱلْعَصْفِ وَٱلرَّيْحَانُ (and grain with husks, and scented plants)
- **V13: فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ** (Refrain #1 in this section)
- V14: خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مِن صَلْصَالٍ كَٱلْفَخَّارِ (created humankind from clay)
- V15: وَخَلَقَ ٱلْجَانَّ مِن مَّارِجٍ مِّن نَّارٍ (created jinn from fire)
- **V16: فَبِأَيِّ آلَاءِ رَبِّكُمَا تُكَذِّبَانِ** (Refrain #2 in this section)

**Analysis:**
1. V13 follows agricultural/earthly blessings (earth, fruit, grain, plants). V16 follows the creation of both humans and jinn.
2. The فَ functions as فَاءُ ٱلتَّفْرِيعِ (consequential fa) — "given THAT..." It creates a logical consequence: blessings listed → challenge follows. The fa makes the refrain a RESPONSE to the preceding content, not a standalone statement.
3. V13 means: "Given THESE earthly blessings (fruit, grain, plants), which favors do you deny?" V16 means: "Given YOUR VERY CREATION (from clay and fire), which favors do you deny?" The identical words carry different weight because the فَ links each to different antecedents. V16's challenge is MORE fundamental — denying creation itself is harder than denying agriculture.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 4: Cross-Surah Comparison (Advanced)">

Compare the refrains in Ar-Rahman (55), Al-Qamar (54), and Al-Mursilat (77):

1. What grammatical structures do they share? (Identify at least 3 common features)
2. How do they differ grammatically? (Identify at least 3 differences)
3. How does each refrain's grammar serve its specific rhetorical function?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Shared grammatical features:**
1. All three are grammatically complete sentences that can stand alone
2. All three use connective particles (فَ or وَ) to link to preceding content
3. All three appear after BLOCKS of content (not after every verse) — creating structural rhythm
4. All three address an audience: dual (Ar-Rahman), singular implied (Al-Qamar), plural (Al-Mursilat)

**Grammatical differences:**
1. **Sentence type:** Ar-Rahman = rhetorical question; Al-Qamar = declaration + genuine-style question; Al-Mursilat = exclamatory nominal sentence
2. **Verb form:** Ar-Rahman = present tense indicative (تُكَذِّبَانِ); Al-Qamar = past tense emphatic (يَسَّرْنَا) + present participle (مُّدَّكِر); Al-Mursilat = no main verb (nominal sentence with وَيْلٌ)
3. **Person/number:** Ar-Rahman = second-person dual (you two); Al-Qamar = first-person plural divine (We) + third-person indefinite (anyone); Al-Mursilat = third-person plural (the deniers)

**Grammar-function alignment:**
- **Ar-Rahman:** Rhetorical question (dual) CHALLENGES both jinn and humans directly. The question form demands response, the dual form includes all creation. Function: confrontation with gratitude
- **Al-Qamar:** Declaration + question OFFERS remembrance after punishment. The emphatic past tense (وَلَقَدْ) asserts certainty, the question (فَهَلْ) opens possibility. Function: mercy after warning
- **Al-Mursilat:** Exclamatory sentence PRONOUNCES judgment. The nominal structure (no verb) makes the warning TIMELESS — not tied to any tense. Function: eschatological threat
