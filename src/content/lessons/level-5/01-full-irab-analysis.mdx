You've spent four levels learning individual grammar tools — cases, verbs, particles, sentence structures, morphological patterns, rhetorical devices. Now it's time to put them ALL together and analyze complete verses systematically.

This four-word phrase contains idafah constructions, adjective agreement, ellipsis, definiteness rules, and multiple rhetorical devices working simultaneously. How do you untangle all these layers? You need a METHOD.

**In this lesson, you will:**
1. Apply a systematic 5-step analysis method to any Quranic verse
2. Integrate nahw (syntax), sarf (morphology), and balagha (rhetoric) in unified analysis
3. Synthesize all concepts from Levels 1-4 simultaneously

**Connection to previous learning:** In [Level 2](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/), you mastered case endings and sentence structures. In [Level 3](/learn/level-3/01-root-system/), you explored morphology and word patterns. In [Level 4](/learn/level-4/01-hal-clauses/), you studied advanced constructions and rhetoric. Now you'll apply ALL of these tools to every word in a verse at the same time.

<Callout type="tip">
Level 5 teaches NO new grammar concepts. Instead, you learn to APPLY everything simultaneously. Think of it as learning to play a complete song after mastering individual notes and scales. The notes themselves haven't changed — but now you're making music.

## The Systematic I'rab Method (5 Steps)

Classical scholars developed a systematic approach to analyzing Quranic verses that ensures no grammatical, morphological, or rhetorical element is overlooked. This method is called **i'rab** (iʿrāb / إِعْرَابٌ) — comprehensive grammatical analysis.

The 5-step method provides a framework for dissecting ANY verse, from the simplest to the most complex:

### Step 1: Segment the Verse (التَّقْطِيعُ — at-taqṭīʿu)

Before analyzing anything, you must identify the BOUNDARIES of grammatical units.

**What to do:**
- Break the verse into individual words
- Identify multi-word phrases that function as single units (jarr wa-majrur, idafah pairs, adjective-noun pairs)
- Mark where one grammatical phrase ends and another begins

**Why it matters:** You can't analyze relationships until you know what the units ARE. Is "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ" two separate words or a single idafah construction? Segmentation answers this first.

**Example:**
- Text: بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ
- Segmentation: [بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ] | [ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ] | [ٱلرَّحِيمِ]
- Three units: one idafah construction + two adjectives

### Step 2: Identify Sentence Type (تَحْدِيدُ نَوْعِ ٱلْجُمْلَةِ — taḥdīdu nawʿi l-jumlati)

Every Quranic statement is either a nominal sentence or a verbal sentence. Identifying which type is foundational to all further analysis.

**What to ask:**
1. Does the sentence begin with a noun? → Nominal sentence ([jumlah ismiyyah](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah))
2. Does the sentence begin with a verb? → Verbal sentence ([jumlah fi'liyyah](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-filiyyah))
3. Is an expected element missing? → Check for ellipsis ([hadhf](/resources/glossary/#hadhf))

**Why it matters:** Sentence type determines the grammatical functions available. Nominal sentences have mubtada and khabar. Verbal sentences have fa'il and potentially maf'ul. Different structures, different analysis paths.

**Common patterns:**
- Nominal with explicit mubtada: "ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ" (Al-hamd is mubtada, lillah is khabar)
- Verbal with fa'il: "قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" (qul is verb + implied fa'il)
- Nominal with hadhf: "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ" (verb أَبْدَأُ is omitted)

<Callout type="tip">
If you can't immediately identify whether a sentence is nominal or verbal, look for the FIRST grammatical element (ignoring particles). If it's a noun, start with nominal analysis. If it's a verb, start with verbal analysis. Then check if anything expected is missing.
</Callout>

### Step 3: Analyze Each Word — Three-Level Analysis

This is the CORE of i'rab. For EVERY word in the verse, you perform THREE types of analysis simultaneously:

#### Level 1: Syntactic Analysis (Nahw — النَّحْوُ)

**What to determine:**
1. **Function:** What role does this word play in the sentence?
   - Subject (mubtada, fa'il, na'ib al-fa'il)
   - Predicate (khabar)
   - Object (maf'ul bihi, maf'ul mutlaq, maf'ul li-ajlih, maf'ul ma'ah)
   - Modifiers (na't, hal, tamyiz)
   - Idafah components (mudaf, mudaf ilayh)
   - Jarr wa-majrur constructions
   - Other specialized functions ([badal](/resources/glossary/#badal), [tawkid](/resources/glossary/#tawkid), etc.)

2. **Case/Mood:** What is the i'rab marking?
   - Nominative (raf' / رَفْعٌ)
   - Accusative (nasb / نَصْبٌ)
   - Genitive (jarr / جَرٌّ)
   - Jussive (jazm / جَزْمٌ — for verbs)

3. **Case Marker:** HOW is the case shown?
   - Damma (ـُ), fatha (ـَ), kasra (ـِ), sukun (ـْ)
   - Special markers for dual/sound plural (alif, ya, nun)
   - No visible marker (diptotes, indeclinable words)

4. **Reason:** WHY does this word have this case?
   - Subject of nominal sentence (mubtada in raf')
   - Object of verb (maf'ul bihi in nasb)
   - Object of preposition (ism majrur in jarr)
   - Adjective agreement (na't follows modified noun)
   - And so on...

**Connection to prior learning:** All of [Level 2, Lessons 4-6](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/) covered case theory. Step 3 applies those rules to every word.

#### Level 2: Morphological Analysis (Sarf — ٱلصَّرْفُ)

**What to determine:**
1. **Root:** What is the three-letter (sometimes four-letter) root?
   - Example: كَتَبَ from root ك-ت-ب (semantic field: writing)

2. **Pattern (wazn):** What morphological pattern does this word follow?
   - Example: كِتَابٌ follows فِعَالٌ pattern
   - Pattern determines word type (verbal noun, active participle, intensive adjective, etc.)

3. **Form (for verbs):** Which of the 10 verb forms (I-X)?
   - Form I: simple action (كَتَبَ — he wrote)
   - Form II: intensive/causative (كَتَّبَ — he made write repeatedly)
   - Form IV: causative (أَكْتَبَ — he caused to write)
   - Form VIII: reflexive (اِكْتَتَبَ — he wrote for himself)

4. **Definiteness:** How is this word made definite or indefinite?
   - Definite article (ٱلْ)
   - Idafah (second term of possession construction)
   - Proper noun (inherently definite)
   - Indefinite (tanwin)

**Connection to prior learning:** All of [Level 3](/learn/level-3/01-root-system/) covered morphology. Step 3 applies sarf analysis to every word alongside nahw.

#### Level 3: Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha — ٱلْبَلَاغَةُ)

**What to determine:**
1. **Deviation from standard:** Does this word's position, form, or presence deviate from normal Arabic expression?
   - Standard: verb-subject-object
   - Deviation: object-verb-subject (as in "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ")

2. **Rhetorical device:** What figure of speech is being employed?
   - [Taqdim](/resources/glossary/#taqdim) (fronting for emphasis)
   - [Hadhf](/resources/glossary/#hadhf) (ellipsis for conciseness)
   - [Tashbih](/resources/glossary/#tashbih) (simile)
   - [Isti'arah](/resources/glossary/#istiarah) (metaphor)
   - [Mubalagha](/resources/glossary/#mubalagha) (hyperbole/intensification)
   - And many others (see [L4.16-17](/learn/level-4/16-intro-balagha/))

3. **Purpose:** WHY was this rhetorical choice made?
   - Emphasis or exclusivity
   - Conciseness or eloquence
   - Emotional impact
   - Highlighting a particular meaning
   - Creating rhythm or rhyme (saj')

**Connection to prior learning:** [L4.16 Introduction to Balagha](/learn/level-4/16-intro-balagha/) and [L4.17 Figures of Speech](/learn/level-4/17-figures-of-speech/) introduced these concepts. Now you apply them systematically to every verse.

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't get overwhelmed!** You don't need to identify EVERY morphological detail or EVERY rhetorical device for EVERY word. Focus on:
1. MAJOR syntactic structures first (sentence type, main subject/verb, objects)
2. Then add morphological insights for KEY words (unusual patterns, special forms)
3. Finally look for PROMINENT rhetorical features (obvious deviations, well-known devices)

Completeness comes with practice. Understanding comes with prioritization.
</Callout>

### Step 4: Map Relationships (رَسْمُ ٱلْعَلَاقَاتِ — rasmu l-ʿalāqāti)

After analyzing individual words, you must understand how they CONNECT.

**What to map:**
1. **Subject-predicate relationships:**
   - Which noun is the subject? Which is its predicate?
   - Example: ٱلْحَمْدُ (subject) لِلَّهِ (predicate)

2. **Verb-object relationships:**
   - Which verb governs which object?
   - Example: نَعْبُدُ (verb) إِيَّاكَ (object)

3. **Modifier-modified relationships:**
   - Which adjective modifies which noun?
   - Which hal describes which subject/object?
   - Example: ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ modifies ٱللَّهِ

4. **Idafah chains:**
   - What is possessed? Who possesses it?
   - Example: بِسْمِ (possessed) ٱللَّهِ (possessor)

5. **Jarr wa-majrur attachment:**
   - Which preposition phrase attaches to which verb or noun?
   - Example: لِلَّهِ attaches to ٱلْحَمْدُ

6. **Conjunctions:**
   - What does وَ connect? Is it connecting words, phrases, or entire sentences?

**Why it matters:** Grammar is about RELATIONSHIPS, not just isolated words. Mapping connections reveals the sentence's structural logic.

**Technique:** Draw arrows (mentally or on paper) showing which words depend on which. This creates a visual "parse tree" of the sentence.

### Step 5: Rhetorical Analysis (ٱلتَّحْلِيلُ ٱلْبَلَاغِيُّ — at-taḥlīlu l-balāghiyyu)

After completing syntactic and morphological analysis, step back and ask: what is the OVERALL rhetorical effect?

**What to ask:**
1. **Why THIS sentence structure?** Why did the Quran use nominal instead of verbal? Why this word order instead of the standard order?

2. **What rhetorical devices work TOGETHER?** Often multiple balagha techniques combine in a single verse (hadhf + taqdim + saj').

3. **How does grammar serve meaning?** What theological, emotional, or logical point is emphasized by these grammatical choices?

4. **What alternative phrasing could have been used?** Classical scholars often compare the Quranic choice with hypothetical alternatives to highlight the superior eloquence.

**Why it matters:** I'rab is not just about DESCRIBING grammar. It's about understanding WHY the Quran is inimitable ([i'jaz](/resources/glossary/#ijaz)). Step 5 reveals how grammatical choices create meaning beyond literal translation.

<Callout type="rule">
**The Systematic I'rab Method:** (1) Segment the verse into grammatical units. (2) Identify sentence type (nominal/verbal) and check for ellipsis. (3) Analyze each word at three levels: syntax (function + case), morphology (root + pattern), and rhetoric (devices + purpose). (4) Map relationships between words. (5) Analyze overall rhetorical effect. Apply this method to EVERY verse you study in Level 5.

## Guided Example: Complete Bismillah Analysis

Let's apply all 5 steps to the most recited verse in the Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="bismi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi"
  translation="In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "بِسْمِ", tr: "bismi", en: "In the name (of)" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ", tr: "r-raḥmāni", en: "the Most Gracious" },
    { ar: "ٱلرَّحِيمِ", tr: "r-raḥīmi", en: "the Most Merciful" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 1: Segment the Verse

Breaking into units:
1. **بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ** — jarr wa-majrur + idafah construction (one unit with two words)
2. **ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ** — adjective (separate unit)
3. **ٱلرَّحِيمِ** — adjective (separate unit)

Total: 4 words forming 3 grammatical units (one compound, two simple).

### Step 2: Identify Sentence Type

**Initial observation:** The verse begins with a preposition (بِـ), not a noun or verb. Where's the sentence structure?

**Answer:** This is a **nominal sentence with ellipsis (hadhf)**. The verb is omitted for conciseness.

**Reconstructed full sentence:** "أَبْدَأُ بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
- Verb: أَبْدَأُ (abda'u — I begin)
- Fa'il: (anā, first person singular pronoun, implied in verb conjugation)
- Jarr wa-majrur: بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ (with the name of Allah)

**Why ellipsis?** Classical scholars explain that omitting the verb achieves multiple rhetorical purposes:
1. **Generality:** The omitted verb can be "I begin," "I recite," "I do," "I seek help" — the listener supplies the appropriate verb for their context
2. **Conciseness:** Four words instead of six
3. **Focus:** Shifts emphasis to the NAME (al-ism) rather than the action

### Step 3: Analyze Each Word (Three Levels)

#### Word 1: بِسْمِ

**Syntactic Analysis (Nahw):**
- **Function:** Part of a jarr wa-majrur construction (preposition + noun); the entire phrase acts as an adverbial adjunct (relating to the omitted verb)
- **Case:** Genitive (jarr)
- **Case Marker:** Kasra on ـِ (بِسْمِ)
- **Reason:** Follows the preposition بِـ; all nouns after prepositions take jarr case ([L2.04](/learn/level-2/04-nominative-case/))

**Morphological Analysis (Sarf):**
- **Root:** س-م-و (s-m-w) — semantic field: "height, elevation, naming"
- **Pattern:** اِسْمٌ (ism) — basic noun pattern فِعْلٌ
- **Form:** Simple noun (not derived from verb)
- **Definiteness:** Made definite through **idafah** (possession construction) — بِسْمِ is the mudaf (first term), ٱللَّهِ is the mudaf ilayh (second term). The second term's definiteness makes the entire construction definite ([L2.10](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/))

**Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha):**
- **Device:** [Hadhf](/resources/glossary/#hadhf) (ellipsis of verb) + [Taqdim](/resources/glossary/#taqdim) (fronting of jarr wa-majrur)
- **Purpose:** By placing the NAME first (before the omitted verb), the verse emphasizes beginning WITH Allah's name rather than emphasizing the act itself. It's not "I begin (and by the way, it's with Allah's name)" — it's "Allah's name (is how I begin everything)."

#### Word 2: ٱللَّهِ

**Syntactic Analysis (Nahw):**
- **Function:** Mudaf ilayh (second term of idafah) — the possessor in the construction "name of Allah"
- **Case:** Genitive (jarr)
- **Case Marker:** Kasra on ـِ (ٱللَّهِ)
- **Reason:** All mudaf ilayh (second terms of idafah) take jarr case ([L2.10](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/))

**Morphological Analysis (Sarf):**
- **Root:** Proper noun (Allah) — scholars debate whether it's derived from أَلِهَ (to worship) or is an unanalyzable proper name
- **Pattern:** Not from standard patterns — this is the personal name of God
- **Form:** Proper noun
- **Definiteness:** Inherently definite (proper nouns are always definite) + reinforced by the definite article ٱلْـ

**Note on spelling:** The word ٱللَّهِ is written with a shadda (ـّ) on the lam (لّ) to indicate gemination (doubling). This comes from assimilation: original "al-ilah" → "allah" (the l of the article merges with the l of ilah).

**Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha):**
- **Device:** Use of the proper name ٱللَّهُ instead of a pronoun or generic term like "الرَّبُّ" (the Lord)
- **Purpose:** Specificity and reverence. Using the proper name invokes the full majesty and attributes of Allah, not just a functional description.

#### Word 3: ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ

**Syntactic Analysis (Nahw):**
- **Function:** Na't (adjective / صِفَةٌ) modifying ٱللَّهِ
- **Case:** Genitive (jarr)
- **Case Marker:** Kasra on ـِ (ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ)
- **Reason:** Adjectives must agree with the noun they modify in case, number, gender, and definiteness ([L2.11](/learn/level-2/09-adjective-agreement/)). Since ٱللَّهِ is genitive, definite, singular, masculine, so is ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ.

**Morphological Analysis (Sarf):**
- **Root:** ر-ح-م (r-ḥ-m) — semantic field: "mercy, compassion, gentleness"
- **Pattern:** فَعْلَانُ (faʿlān) — intensive adjective pattern indicating EXTREME or ALL-ENCOMPASSING quality
- **Form:** Intensive adjective (implies "The Most Gracious" or "The All-Merciful" — mercy as an inherent, unlimited attribute)
- **Definiteness:** Definite by ٱلْـ article

**Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha):**
- **Device:** [Mubalagha](/resources/glossary/#mubalagha) (intensification through morphological pattern)
- **Purpose:** The فَعْلَانُ pattern doesn't just mean "merciful" — it means mercy is VAST, UNLIMITED, UNIVERSAL. Ar-Rahman describes mercy extending to all creation (believers and disbelievers, in this world).

#### Word 4: ٱلرَّحِيمِ

**Syntactic Analysis (Nahw):**
- **Function:** Na't (adjective) modifying ٱللَّهِ (second adjective in a chain)
- **Case:** Genitive (jarr)
- **Case Marker:** Kasra on ـِ (ٱلرَّحِيمِ)
- **Reason:** Same as ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ — adjective agreement with ٱللَّهِ

**Morphological Analysis (Sarf):**
- **Root:** ر-ح-م (r-ḥ-m) — same root as ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ
- **Pattern:** فَعِيلٌ (faʿīl) — intensive adjective pattern, but with different connotation than فَعْلَانُ
- **Form:** Intensive adjective (implies "The Most Merciful" — mercy as a SPECIFIC, ACTIVE expression toward the believers)
- **Definiteness:** Definite by ٱلْـ article

**Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha):**
- **Device:** [Mubalagha](/resources/glossary/#mubalagha) (intensification) + semantic pairing (two mercy attributes with distinct nuances)
- **Purpose:** Why TWO mercy words? Classical exegesis (tafsir) distinguishes:
  - **Ar-Rahman (ٱلرَّحْمَٰنُ):** Universal mercy in THIS world — encompasses all creation (sun, rain, sustenance for all)
  - **Ar-Rahim (ٱلرَّحِيمُ):** Specific mercy for BELIEVERS in the HEREAFTER — the mercy of salvation, forgiveness, Paradise

Together, they express COMPREHENSIVE mercy: general + specific, worldly + eternal.

### Step 4: Map Relationships

**Idafah chain:**
- بِسْمِ (mudaf) ← ٱللَّهِ (mudaf ilayh)
- Relationship: "name OF Allah" (possession)

**Adjective chain:**
- ٱللَّهِ (modified noun) ← ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (first adjective) ← ٱلرَّحِيمِ (second adjective)
- Relationship: Both adjectives modify ٱللَّهِ

**Jarr wa-majrur attachment:**
- بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ (preposition phrase) → attaches to the omitted verb أَبْدَأُ
- Relationship: adverbial adjunct answering "with what?" (I begin WITH the name of Allah)

**Ellipsis connection:**
- Visible: بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ
- Implied: (أَبْدَأُ) بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ
- The jarr wa-majrur's function depends on the omitted verb

**Visual structure:**
```
[أَبْدَأُ] ← omitted verb (I begin)
    ↓
بِسْمِ ← preposition + noun (with/by name)
    ↓
ٱللَّهِ ← mudaf ilayh (of Allah)
    ↓ modifies
ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ← first adjective (the Most Gracious)
    ↓ modifies
ٱلرَّحِيمِ ← second adjective (the Most Merciful)
```

### Step 5: Verse-Level Rhetorical Analysis

**Overall rhetorical strategies working together:**

1. **Hadhf (ellipsis):** Omitting the verb creates generality and conciseness. Every Muslim reciter supplies their own verb contextually.

2. **Taqdim (fronting):** Placing the name of Allah BEFORE the action emphasizes that the name itself is the foundation of every act. It's not "I do X, and I happen to invoke Allah" — it's "Allah's name is CENTRAL to everything I do."

3. **Saj' (rhyme/rhythm):** The three words ٱللَّهِ، ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ، ٱلرَّحِيمِ create a rhythmic flow ending with similar sounds (-llāhi, -raḥmāni, -raḥīmi), making the verse melodious and memorable.

4. **Dual intensification:** Two intensive mercy adjectives (from the SAME root but different patterns) convey comprehensive mercy without redundancy — one general, one specific.

5. **Theological positioning:** Beginning every surah (except one) with this verse establishes that EVERYTHING in the Quran is contextualized within Allah's mercy. The Quran is not primarily about punishment or law — it's framed first and foremost by divine mercy.

**Why this exact arrangement?**

Hypothetical alternatives the Quran DIDN'T use:
- "بِٱسْمِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ" (omitting ٱللَّهِ) — loses the proper name's specificity and reverence
- "أَبْدَأُ بِٱسْمِ ٱللَّهِ" (including the verb) — loses generality and conciseness
- "بِٱسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ" (one mercy attribute) — loses comprehensiveness (general + specific mercy)

The Quranic choice is maximally eloquent: specific yet general, concise yet comprehensive, rhythmic yet meaningful.

<Callout type="tip">
Notice how a single 4-word phrase contains idafah, adjective agreement, ellipsis, and four distinct balagha devices (hadhf, taqdim, mubalagha, saj'). This is WHY systematic analysis matters — each step reveals layers of meaning that would be missed by casual reading.
</Callout>

## Second Guided Example: Al-Fatiha 1:2 (Partial Analysis)

Now let's see the method applied to a different structure:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ"
  transliteration="al-ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīna"
  translation="All praise is due to Allah, Lord of the worlds"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:2"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱلْحَمْدُ", tr: "al-ḥamdu", en: "All praise" },
    { ar: "لِلَّهِ", tr: "lillāhi", en: "is due to Allah" },
    { ar: "رَبِّ", tr: "rabbi", en: "Lord (of)" },
    { ar: "ٱلْعَالَمِينَ", tr: "l-ʿālamīna", en: "the worlds" }
  ]}
/>

### Step 1: Segment

1. **ٱلْحَمْدُ** — noun (single unit)
2. **لِلَّهِ** — jarr wa-majrur (preposition + noun, one unit)
3. **رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ** — idafah construction (two words, one unit)

Total: 4 words forming 3 grammatical units.

### Step 2: Sentence Type

**Initial observation:** Begins with definite noun ٱلْحَمْدُ.

**Answer:** This is a **nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah)** with explicit mubtada and khabar:
- **Mubtada (subject):** ٱلْحَمْدُ
- **Khabar (predicate):** لِلَّهِ

The structure is: "Praise (belongs) to Allah" — a statement of attribution.

**No ellipsis:** Both elements are present.

### Step 3: Analyze Each Word (Condensed)

#### Word 1: ٱلْحَمْدُ

- **Nahw:** Mubtada (subject of nominal sentence) | Nominative (raf') | Damma | Subject takes raf' case
- **Sarf:** Root ح-م-د (praise) | Pattern فَعْلٌ (basic verbal noun) | Definite by ٱلْـ article
- **Balagha:** Definite article implies "ALL praise" (al-jins — genus/totality), not just "some praise"

#### Word 2: لِلَّهِ

- **Nahw:** Khabar (predicate of nominal sentence) | Jarr wa-majrur acting as khabar | Genitive | Follows preposition لِـ
- **Sarf:** Proper noun ٱللَّهُ | Definite (inherent + article) | After لِـ (preposition meaning "for/to")
- **Balagha:** Khabar as jarr wa-majrur (instead of simple noun) emphasizes DIRECTION and POSSESSION — praise isn't just generically good, it BELONGS to Allah exclusively

#### Word 3: رَبِّ

- **Nahw:** Badal (appositive) elaborating on ٱللَّهِ | Genitive | Kasra | Badal agrees with mubdal minhu in case
- **Sarf:** Root ر-ب-ب (lord, sustainer) | Mudaf (first term of idafah) | Made definite by idafah
- **Balagha:** Badal serves to ELABORATE — not just "Allah" in abstract, but "Allah THE LORD" (with divine attributes of lordship and sustenance)

<Callout type="tip">
**Badal vs. Adjective:** Why is رَبِّ a badal instead of an adjective (na't)?

Because رَبِّ is itself an idafah mudaf — it begins a NEW construction (رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ). Adjectives don't do this. Badal allows one noun to elaborate on another while introducing its own modifying phrase.
</Callout>

#### Word 4: ٱلْعَالَمِينَ

- **Nahw:** Mudaf ilayh (second term of idafah) | Genitive | Ya with nun (sound masculine plural genitive marker) | Mudaf ilayh takes jarr
- **Sarf:** Root ع-ل-م (knowledge, marker, world) | Pattern: فَاعِلٌ (fāʿil) in plural masculine **fāʿilūna** (fāʿilūna, active participle plural) → "the knowing ones, the worlds, all creation" | Definite by ٱلْـ article
- **Balagha:** Plural of ʿālam (world) → "worlds" emphasizes multiplicity of creation (humans, jinn, angels, all realms of existence)

### Step 4: Map Relationships

- **Mubtada-Khabar:** ٱلْحَمْدُ (subject) ← لِلَّهِ (predicate via jarr wa-majrur)
- **Badal:** رَبِّ elaborates on ٱللَّهِ (both refer to the same entity)
- **Idafah:** رَبِّ (mudaf) ← ٱلْعَالَمِينَ (mudaf ilayh) — "Lord OF the worlds"

### Step 5: Verse-Level Rhetoric (Brief)

**Key observations:**
1. **Definite article on ٱلْحَمْدُ:** Implies TOTALITY — "ALL praise" (not just some)
2. **Khabar as jarr wa-majrur:** Emphasizes exclusivity — praise belongs to Allah ALONE (لِلَّهِ "for Allah")
3. **Badal structure:** Adds theological depth — not just abstract praise to "Allah," but praise to "Allah THE LORD of all creation"
4. **Choice of رَبِّ (Lord):** Evokes sustainer, nurturer, master — Allah isn't distant, but actively involved with creation

**Why this structure?** The nominal sentence (rather than verbal like "نَحْمَدُ ٱللَّهَ" — "we praise Allah") creates a timeless, universal statement. It's not "we are praising Allah now" but "praise INHERENTLY belongs to Allah, eternally."

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**The Systematic I'rab Method (Full Statement):**

1. **Segment the verse (التَّقْطِيعُ):** Identify grammatical units — individual words, jarr wa-majrur phrases, idafah constructions, adjective chains.

2. **Identify sentence type (تَحْدِيدُ نَوْعِ ٱلْجُمْلَةِ):** Determine if the sentence is nominal (jumlah ismiyyah) or verbal (jumlah fi'liyyah). Check for ellipsis (hadhf) — is a verb or noun omitted?

3. **Analyze each word (ٱلْإِعْرَابُ ٱلتَّفْصِيلِيُّ):** Perform three-level analysis:
   - **Syntactic (nahw):** Function, case/mood, case marker, reason for case
   - **Morphological (sarf):** Root, pattern (wazn), form (verb forms I-X), definiteness
   - **Rhetorical (balagha):** Deviations from standard, devices employed, purpose of choice

4. **Map relationships (رَسْمُ ٱلْعَلَاقَاتِ):** Show how words connect — subject-predicate, verb-object, modifier-modified, idafah chains, jarr wa-majrur attachment, conjunctions.

5. **Analyze overall rhetoric (ٱلتَّحْلِيلُ ٱلْبَلَاغِيُّ):** Determine the verse-level rhetorical effect — why this structure? How do multiple devices work together? What theological or emotional emphasis is created?

Apply this method systematically to EVERY verse you study in Level 5.
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

<Callout type="warning">
**Mistake 1: Trying to analyze everything at once**

Don't try to perform all three levels of Step 3 simultaneously. Instead:
1. First pass: Complete syntactic analysis (nahw) for ALL words
2. Second pass: Add morphological analysis (sarf) for KEY words
3. Third pass: Identify rhetorical features (balagha)

You can't understand rhetorical choices until you understand the grammar they're built on.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Mistake 2: Skipping Step 2 (sentence type identification)**

If you don't know whether a sentence is nominal or verbal, you'll misidentify grammatical functions. A noun at the beginning of a nominal sentence is a mubtada (subject). The same noun at the beginning of a verbal sentence might be a maf'ul bihi muqaddam (fronted object). Sentence type determines function.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Mistake 3: Ignoring ellipsis (hadhf)**

Many Quranic verses omit expected elements (verbs, subjects, objects) for rhetorical reasons. If your analysis doesn't make sense, ask: "Is something missing?" The omitted element is often the KEY to understanding the verse's structure.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Mistake 4: Over-relying on translation**

English translation can mislead analysis. "All praise is due to Allah" sounds like "praise" is a noun and "due to Allah" is a verb phrase. Actually, it's a nominal sentence with jarr wa-majrur khabar. Always analyze the ARABIC structure, not the English translation structure.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
**Prioritize understanding over completeness.** Classical scholars debated some grammatical parsings for centuries. Your goal in Level 5 is systematic COMPETENCY, not exhaustive MASTERY. Focus on:
1. Identifying major structures correctly (sentence type, main subject/verb/object)
2. Understanding case assignments for key words
3. Recognizing prominent rhetorical features

With practice, deeper analysis will come naturally.
</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 1: Method Application (Guided)">

Apply Steps 1-2 to this verse from Surah Al-Ikhlas:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, the One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "Say" },
    { ar: "هُوَ", tr: "huwa", en: "He is" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهُ", tr: "llāhu", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "أَحَدٌ", tr: "aḥadun", en: "the One" }
  ]}
/>

**Tasks:**
1. Segment the verse into grammatical units
2. Identify the sentence type of "هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" (nominal or verbal?)
3. Identify any ellipsis

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Step 1: Segmentation**
- قُلْ — verb (single unit)
- هُوَ — pronoun (single unit)
- ٱللَّهُ — noun (single unit)
- أَحَدٌ — noun (single unit)

Total: 4 words, 4 units (no multi-word constructions in this verse)

**Step 2: Sentence Type**
- قُلْ is a **verbal sentence** (command verb + implied subject "أَنْتَ" — you)
- The verb قُلْ governs an entire clause as its object (what should be said)
- هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ is a **nominal sentence** (jumlah ismiyyah) serving as the object of قُلْ:
  - Mubtada: هُوَ (He)
  - Khabar: ٱللَّهُ (Allah)
  - أَحَدٌ is either a second khabar OR a na't (adjective) modifying ٱللَّهُ

**Ellipsis check:** No ellipsis in this structure. All elements are present.

**Structure:** Command verb governing a nominal clause as its object.

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 2: Word Analysis (Intermediate)">

Complete Step 3 (syntactic analysis ONLY — nahw) for each word in this phrase:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ"
  transliteration="al-ḥamdu lillāhi"
  translation="All praise is due to Allah"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:2"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱلْحَمْدُ", tr: "al-ḥamdu", en: "All praise" },
    { ar: "لِلَّهِ", tr: "lillāhi", en: "is due to Allah" }
  ]}
/>

For each word, provide:
1. Function (mubtada, khabar, maf'ul, etc.)
2. Case/Mood (raf', nasb, jarr, jazm)
3. Case Marker (damma, fatha, kasra, etc.)
4. Reason (why this case?)

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Word 1: ٱلْحَمْدُ**
1. Function: Mubtada (subject of nominal sentence)
2. Case: Nominative (raf')
3. Case Marker: Damma (ـُ) on ٱلْحَمْدُ
4. Reason: Subjects of nominal sentences always take nominative case ([L2.04](/learn/level-2/04-nominative-case/))

**Word 2: لِلَّهِ**
1. Function: Khabar (predicate of nominal sentence) — specifically, a jarr wa-majrur phrase acting as khabar
2. Case: Genitive (jarr) — applied to ٱللَّهِ within the jarr wa-majrur
3. Case Marker: Kasra (ـِ) on ٱللَّهِ
4. Reason: Nouns following prepositions (لِـ in this case) always take genitive case ([L2.06](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/))

**Note:** The ENTIRE phrase لِلَّهِ (preposition + noun) functions as the khabar. Jarr wa-majrur can serve as predicates in nominal sentences, answering "where?" or "for whom?" or "to whom?" about the subject.

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 3: Relationship Mapping (Intermediate)">

For the Bismillah, draw the relationship map answering these questions:
1. Which words are in idafah? What is the mudaf and mudaf ilayh?
2. Which words are adjectives? What noun do they modify?
3. What is the function of the entire jarr wa-majrur phrase? (What omitted verb does it attach to?)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"

**1. Idafah Construction:**
- **Mudaf (possessed):** بِسْمِ (name)
- **Mudaf ilayh (possessor):** ٱللَّهِ (Allah)
- Relationship: "name OF Allah" (possession/attribution)

**2. Adjective Chain:**
- **Modified noun:** ٱللَّهِ (Allah)
- **First adjective:** ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (the Most Gracious)
- **Second adjective:** ٱلرَّحِيمِ (the Most Merciful)
- Both adjectives modify ٱللَّهِ and agree with it in case (genitive), number (singular), gender (masculine), and definiteness (definite)

**3. Jarr wa-Majrur Attachment:**
- The entire phrase بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ acts as an adverbial adjunct
- It attaches to the omitted verb أَبْدَأُ (I begin) or أَقْرَأُ (I recite) or similar
- Function: Answers "with what?" or "in what manner?" → "I begin WITH/IN the name of Allah"

**Visual Map:**
```
[أَبْدَأُ] ← omitted verb
    ↓ governs
بِسْمِ ← mudaf (jarr wa-majrur attached to verb)
    ↓ idafah
ٱللَّهِ ← mudaf ilayh
    ↓ modified by
ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ← first adjective
    ↓ modified by
ٱلرَّحِيمِ ← second adjective

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Step 1: Segmentation**
- رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ — idafah construction (two words, one unit)

**Step 2: Sentence Type**
This is NOT a complete sentence. It's a PHRASE functioning as a badal (appositive) elaborating on "ٱللَّهِ" in the previous phrase "ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ."

**Step 3: Word Analysis**

*Word 1: رَبِّ*
- **Nahw:** Badal (appositive) elaborating on ٱللَّهِ | Genitive | Kasra | Badal agrees with mubdal minhu (ٱللَّهِ) in case
- **Sarf:** Root ر-ب-ب (lordship, sustenance) | Pattern فَعْلٌ (basic noun) | Mudaf (made definite by idafah with ٱلْعَالَمِينَ)

*Word 2: ٱلْعَالَمِينَ*
- **Nahw:** Mudaf ilayh (second term of idafah) | Genitive | Ya + nun (sound masculine plural genitive marker) | Mudaf ilayh always takes jarr
- **Sarf:** Root ع-ل-م (knowledge, marker, world) | Pattern: فَاعِلٌ (fāʿil) in plural masculine **fāʿilūna** (fāʿilūna, active participle plural, here meaning "worlds, realms of creation") | Definite by ٱلْـ article

**Step 4: Relationship Map**
- **Idafah:** رَبِّ (mudaf) ← ٱلْعَالَمِينَ (mudaf ilayh) — "Lord OF the worlds"
- **Badal connection:** رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ elaborates on ٱللَّهِ from the previous phrase

**Step 5: Balagha Observation**

**Device:** Badal (appositive elaboration) + [Ta'kid](/resources/glossary/#tawkid) (emphasis through restatement)

**Purpose:** The phrase "رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ" doesn't just repeat that we're talking about Allah — it ADDS theological information. It emphasizes Allah's attribute of lordship (رَبِّ) and His sovereignty over ALL realms of creation (ٱلْعَالَمِينَ).

The plural "worlds" (instead of singular "world") emphasizes the vastness and diversity of creation — human world, jinn world, angelic realms, the seen and unseen. Allah is not just lord of ONE domain, but of EVERY domain.

**Why not just say "ٱللَّهِ" alone?** The elaboration serves to ground praise in Allah's active relationship with creation. We don't praise an abstract deity — we praise the Lord who sustains and governs all existence.
