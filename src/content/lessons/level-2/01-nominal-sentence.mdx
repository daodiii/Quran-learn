## Introduction

Welcome to Level 2! This is where your foundation transforms into mastery. In Level 1, you learned to RECOGNIZE grammar patterns. In Level 2, you'll learn to ANALYZE them with precision.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, [the] One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
/>

The clause "هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" (huwa llāhu aḥadun) is a perfect example of a [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة). It begins with a pronoun (a type of noun) and describes a state of being. This single verse demonstrates the elegance and power of Arabic's nominal sentence structure.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Define a nominal sentence as one beginning with a noun and understand its structural requirements
- Identify the two essential components: [subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ) and [predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar) (khabar)
- Perform grammatical analysis (iʿrāb) on nominal sentences from Quranic verses
- Recognize how nominal sentences convey permanent truths and essential attributes

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L1.10 Simple Sentences](/learn/level-1/10-simple-sentences/), you learned to identify nominal sentences by their first word. In [L1.11 Case Endings](/learn/level-1/11-case-endings/), you discovered that both parts take nominative case. Now we'll explore WHY this structure works and how to analyze it with precision.

**Key Level 2 transition:** Level 1 was about RECOGNITION — you learned to spot patterns. Level 2 is about MASTERY — you'll learn to analyze every word's grammatical function using the traditional tools of Arabic grammar scholars.

## Understanding the Nominal Sentence

**Plain English first:** A nominal sentence is like making a statement by placing two nouns side by side. The first noun establishes WHAT you're talking about, and the second noun tells us SOMETHING about it. Think of it as a two-part announcement: "Topic: X. Information: Y."

**English analogy:** In English, we use the verb "to be" to connect subjects and descriptions: "The sky IS blue," "Allah IS Merciful," "The book IS on the table." Arabic does something more elegant — it simply places the two nouns together, and the meaning "is" happens automatically. It's like saying "The sky — blue" and understanding the connection without needing a linking verb.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** A [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة) has two essential components:

1. **[Subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada)** (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — literally "the begun with," the topic being discussed
2. **[Predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar)** (khabar / خَبَرٌ) — literally "the news" or "the information," what you're saying about the topic

**The fundamental rule:** Both the mubtadaʾ and khabar take the [nominative case](/resources/glossary/#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْعٌ), marked by damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ).

### The Key Insight: No "Is" in Arabic

Arabic nominal sentences don't use a verb meaning "is," "am," or "are" in the present tense. The juxtaposition of two nominative nouns creates this meaning automatically. This is called a "zero copula" in linguistics — the linking verb is understood but not stated.

**Examples:**
- **ٱللَّهُ رَحِيمٌ** (allāhu raḥīmun) — "Allah (is) Merciful"
- **ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ** (al-ḥamdu lillāhi) — "The praise (is) for Allah"
- **هُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ** (huwa l-ḥaqqu) — "He (is) the Truth"

### Structure: Mubtadaʾ + Khabar

<GrammarTable>
| Component | Arabic Term | Grammatical Case | Typical Form | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Subject** | مُبْتَدَأ (mubtadaʾ) | Nominative (rafʿ) | Noun, pronoun, or noun phrase | ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) |
| **Predicate** | خَبَر (khabar) | Nominative (rafʿ) | Noun, adjective, phrase, or sentence | أَحَدٌ (aḥadun) |
</GrammarTable>

### Types of Predicates

The predicate (خَبَرٌ khabar) can take several forms:

1. **Single word (noun or adjective):** ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ — "Allah (is) One"
2. **Prepositional phrase:** ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ — "The praise (is) for Allah"
3. **Another sentence (nominal or verbal):** ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ — "Allah knows" (literally: "Allah — He knows")

For now, we'll focus on the first two types. Complex predicates will be covered in [L2.02](/learn/level-2/02-subject-predicate/).

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Surah Al-Ikhlas (112), a perfect demonstration of nominal sentence structures. This surah presents profound theological truths using simple, powerful nominal sentences.

### Example 1: Basic Nominal Sentence with Pronoun Subject

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, [the] One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **قُلْ** (qul) — Verb: imperative command, "say"
  - Function: Command verb
  - Case: Verbs don't take case (this is Form I imperative)
  - Reason: Addressing the Prophet (peace be upon him)

The nominal sentence begins after the command:

- **هُوَ** (huwa) — Subject (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Pronouns don't visibly change for case
  - Reason: Independent pronoun serving as subject

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — First predicate (khabar)
  - Function: Predicate identifying the pronoun
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Predicate of nominal sentence takes nominative

- **أَحَدٌ** (aḥadun) — Second predicate (khabar thānin)
  - Function: Second predicate describing Allah
  - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
  - Reason: Predicate of nominal sentence takes nominative

**Structural insight:** This verse contains one subject (هُوَ) with two predicates (ٱللَّهُ and أَحَدٌ), both describing the same entity. The structure emphasizes Allah's identity and oneness simultaneously.

### Example 2: Definite Noun as Both Parts

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="Allah is the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="ٱللَّهُ,ٱلصَّمَدُ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — Subject (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject (mubtadaʾ) always takes nominative case

- **ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu) — Predicate (khabar)
  - Function: Predicate describing Allah's attribute
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Predicate (khabar) takes nominative to match subject

**Word-by-word morphological breakdown:**

**ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu):
- Root: ا-ل-ه (hamza-lam-ha), related to divinity/worship
- Form: Proper noun (divine name)
- Definiteness: Definite by nature (proper name)
- Case: Nominative (mubtadaʾ)

**ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu):
- Root: ص-م-د (ṣad-mim-dal), meaning eternal, absolute
- Form: Adjective/attribute pattern فَعَلٌ
- Definiteness: Definite with ال article
- Case: Nominative (خَبَرٌ khabar)

**Theological precision through grammar:** The use of the definite article (ال) on both words emphasizes that Allah IS the definite, complete embodiment of eternal refuge — not merely "a" refuge, but THE refuge.

### Example 3: Nominal Sentence with Negation

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ"
  transliteration="wa lam yakun lahū kufuwan aḥadun"
  translation="Nor is there to Him any equivalent"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:4"
  highlight="كُفُوًا,أَحَدٌۢ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **لَمْ** (lam) — Negation particle
  - Function: Negates past tense verb
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Introduces negated verb

- **يَكُنْ** (yakun) — Defective verb (from كَانَ kāna)
  - Function: Verb meaning "to be" (negated)
  - Case marker: Jussive mood (ending with sukūn)
  - Reason: Jussive after لَمْ

- **لَّهُۥ** (lahū) — Prepositional phrase
  - Function: Predicate (خَبَرٌ khabar) advanced before subject
  - Case: هُ attached pronoun in genitive after preposition لِ
  - Reason: Prepositional phrase serving as predicate

- **كُفُوًا** (kufuwan) — Predicate of كَانَ kāna
  - Function: Predicate of كَانَ (khabar kāna)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: كَانَ puts its predicate in accusative case

- **أَحَدٌۢ** (aḥadun) — Subject of كَانَ kāna
  - Function: Subject (ism kāna)
  - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
  - Reason: Subject of كَانَ remains nominative

**Advanced note:** The verb كَانَ (kāna) "was/is" is special — when it enters a nominal sentence, the subject stays nominative but the predicate shifts to accusative. You'll study this in detail in [L2.11 Kaana and Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/).

### Example 4: Multiple Nominal Sentences

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِىَ دِينِ"
  transliteration="lakum dīnukum wa liya dīni"
  translation="For you is your religion, and for me is my religion"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:6"
  highlight="دِينُكُمْ,دِينِ"
/>

**First nominal sentence:**

- **لَكُمْ** (lakum) — Predicate (khabar muqaddam)
  - Function: Predicate advanced before subject
  - Case marker: كُمْ attached pronoun in genitive after preposition لِ
  - Reason: Prepositional phrase serving as fronted predicate

- **دِينُكُمْ** (dīnukum) — Subject (mubtadaʾ muʾakhkhar)
  - Function: Subject postponed after predicate
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ) + possessive suffix كُمْ
  - Reason: Subject takes nominative even when word order inverts

**Second nominal sentence:**

- **لِىَ** (liya) — Predicate (khabar muqaddam)
  - Function: Predicate advanced before subject
  - Case marker: Attached pronoun ى in genitive after preposition لِ
  - Reason: Prepositional phrase serving as fronted predicate

- **دِينِي** (dīnī) — Subject (mubtadaʾ muʾakhkhar)
  - Function: Subject postponed after predicate
  - Case marker: Nominative damma + attached pronoun (not visible due to ى)
  - Reason: Subject takes nominative; appears as kasra due to first-person possessive

**Advanced structure:** When a nominal sentence begins with a prepositional phrase, the predicate comes BEFORE the subject. This fronting creates emphasis: "To YOU belongs your religion; to ME belongs my (دِينِي dīnī) religion."

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Nominal Sentence Structure">

A [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة) consists of two parts, both in the nominative case:

1. **Subject (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ)** — the topic being discussed
   - Takes nominative case (rafʿ): damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)
   - Usually comes first (but can be postponed)

2. **Predicate (khabar / خَبَرٌ)** — the information about the topic
   - Takes nominative case (rafʿ): damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)
   - Can be a noun, adjective, prepositional phrase, or sentence

**Essential characteristic:** No present-tense linking verb is needed. The nominative case on both parts creates the meaning "is/are" automatically.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't assume word order is completely flexible.** While Arabic allows the predicate to come before the subject (especially with prepositional phrases), changing word order changes EMPHASIS and sometimes meaning. The standard, unmarked order is: Subject → Predicate. Inversion creates special rhetorical effects (see [L5.14: Word Order & Emphasis](/learn/level-5/14-word-order-emphasis/)).

**Don't add a linking verb in present tense.** English speakers often want to insert "is/are" — resist this urge! The sentence ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ literally means "Allah One" and the relationship is understood through grammatical structure.

**Don't confuse the subject (mubtadaʾ) with the subject of a verbal sentence (fāʿil).** Though both take nominative case, they function differently:
- Mubtadaʾ: topic of a nominal sentence (sentence BEGINS with it)
- Fāʿil: doer of action in verbal sentence (comes AFTER the verb)

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify the mubtadaʾ and khabar in this verse: ٱللَّهُ نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ (allāhu nūru s-samāwāti wa-l-arḍi) — 'Allah is the Light of the heavens and the earth' [An-Nur 24:35]">

**Answer:**

- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) — "Allah"
- **Predicate (خَبَرٌ khabar):** نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ (nūru s-samāwāti wa-l-arḍi) — "the Light of the heavens and the earth"

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject always takes nominative case

- **نُورُ ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ** (nūru s-samāwāti)
  - Function: Predicate of nominal sentence (خَبَرٌ khabar)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ) on نُورُ
  - Reason: Predicate takes nominative to match subject

The phrase "ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ وَٱلْأَرْضِ" (of the heavens and the earth) is a possessive construction (iḍāfah) attached to نُورُ, making the entire phrase the predicate. The genitive words ٱلسَّمَٰوَٰتِ and ٱلْأَرْضِ define WHICH light — the Light OF the heavens and earth.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Explain why both words in this nominal sentence take nominative case: ٱلْقُرْآنُ هُدًى (al-qurʾānu hudan) — 'The Quran is guidance' [Al-Baqarah 2:2]">

**Answer:**

Both words take nominative case because they form a complete nominal sentence:

- **ٱلْقُرْآنُ** (al-qurʾānu) — Subject (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Topic being discussed (what we're making a statement about)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject of a nominal sentence ALWAYS takes nominative case

- **هُدًى** (hudan) — Predicate (خَبَرٌ khabar)
  - Function: Information about the subject (what we're saying about the Quran)
  - Case marker: Nominative (appears as fathatain ـً due to alif maqṣūrah ى)
  - Reason: Predicate of a nominal sentence takes nominative to agree with the subject

**The rule:** In a basic nominal sentence (without modifying particles like إِنَّ or كَانَ kāna), both the mubtadaʾ and خَبَرٌ khabar take nominative case. This dual nominative marking is the grammatical signature of the nominal sentence structure.

**Note on appearance:** The word هُدًى looks like it has fathatain (accusative marker), but this is because words ending in alif maqṣūrah (ى) show case differently. The grammatical case is still nominative.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Perform complete iʿrāb analysis on this nominal sentence: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīna) — 'All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds' [Al-Fatiha 1:2]">

**Answer:**

**Complete grammatical analysis:**

- **ٱلْحَمْدُ** (al-ḥamdu) — Subject (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject takes nominative case

- **لِلَّهِ** (lillāhi) — Predicate (khabar)
  - Function: Prepositional phrase serving as predicate
  - Case marker: لِ is preposition; ٱللَّهِ is genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Prepositions trigger genitive case; the entire phrase is the predicate

- **رَبِّ** (rabbi) — Appositive/attributive (badal or ṣifah)
  - Function: Describes ٱللَّهِ (Lord)
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Follows and describes a genitive noun, so matches its case

- **ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ** (al-ʿālamīna) — Genitive in possessive construction
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah with رَبِّ (Lord OF the worlds)
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra + ـِينَ sound masculine plural ending
  - Reason: Second noun in iḍāfah always takes genitive case

**Structure insight:** This nominal sentence has:
1. Subject: ٱلْحَمْدُ (the praise)
2. Predicate: لِلَّهِ (for Allah) — a prepositional phrase acting as khabar
3. Additional description: رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (Lord of the worlds) — describing Allah

The predicate here is NOT a single word but a complete prepositional phrase. This demonstrates that the khabar can be more complex than a simple adjective or noun.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Create a nominal sentence using these components and perform iʿrāb: ٱلْعِلْمُ (al-ʿilmu) 'knowledge' + نُورٌ (nūrun) 'a light'">

**Answer:**

**Nominal sentence:** ٱلْعِلْمُ نُورٌ (al-ʿilmu nūrun) — "Knowledge is a light"

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **ٱلْعِلْمُ** (al-ʿilmu) — Subject (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (the topic)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject of nominal sentence takes nominative case
  - Definiteness: Definite with ال article

- **نُورٌ** (nūrun) — Predicate (خَبَرٌ khabar)
  - Function: Predicate of nominal sentence (information about the subject)
  - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
  - Reason: Predicate takes nominative to match the subject
  - Definiteness: Indefinite (no article, has tanwīn)

**Grammatical insight:** Notice that the subject is definite (ٱلْعِلْمُ with ال) while the predicate is indefinite (نُورٌ nūrun with tanwīn). This is a common and natural pattern:
- Definite subject + indefinite predicate = describing a quality or category
- "Knowledge is (a type of) light" — not "Knowledge is THE light"

The indefiniteness of the predicate creates a metaphorical, descriptive meaning rather than an identification statement.
