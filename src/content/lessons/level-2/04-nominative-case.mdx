## Introduction

In [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/), you learned to RECOGNIZE the nominative case marker visually — the damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ). Now it's time for MASTERY: learning exactly WHEN and WHY Arabic nouns take this case. Welcome to the precision of grammatical analysis.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ"
  transliteration="idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wa-l-fatḥu"
  translation="When the help of Allah and the victory comes"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:1"
  highlight="نَصْرُ,ٱلْفَتْحُ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِذَا", tr: "idhā", en: "when" },
    { ar: "جَآءَ", tr: "jāʾa", en: "comes" },
    { ar: "نَصْرُ", tr: "naṣru", en: "help" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "of Allah" },
    { ar: "وَٱلْفَتْحُ", tr: "wa-l-fatḥu", en: "and the victory" }
  ]}
/>

Both نَصْرُ (naṣru) and ٱلْفَتْحُ (al-fatḥu) end with damma — the nominative marker. Why? Because both are serving as the subject (fāʿil) of the verb جَآءَ (jāʾa) "came." In this lesson, you'll master all four situations where the nominative case applies.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand when and why nouns take the [nominative case](/resources/glossary/#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْعٌ)
- Recognize nominative markers across different noun forms: singular, dual, and plural
- Apply nominative case to subjects in both nominal and verbal sentences
- Analyze coordinated nouns and their case agreement

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/), you learned that case endings mark grammatical function — you could RECOGNIZE them. Now you'll learn the RULES: exactly which grammatical functions trigger nominative case. This is the bridge from recognition to mastery.

**Key Level 2 transition:** Level 1 taught you WHAT the nominative case looks like. Level 2 teaches you WHEN to use it and WHY. By the end of this lesson, you'll be able to predict which words in a sentence will take nominative case before you even see the vowel marks.

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Matters in Your Quran Reading">
The nominative case marks the DOER — the one performing the action. Every time you see a damma (ـُ) on a noun in the Quran, it's telling you: "This word is the subject or topic." Recognizing this instantly reveals WHO is acting in every verse.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Quick Win">
In كَتَبَ ٱللَّهُ ("Allah has decreed"), the damma on ٱللَّهُ tells you Allah is the DOER. You can already identify the subject of any verb by looking for that damma.
</Callout>

## Understanding the Nominative Case

**Plain English first:** The nominative case is the "doer" or "topic" case. It marks words that are either DOING something (the subject of an action) or being DISCUSSED (the topic of a statement). Think of nominative as the "spotlight" case — it highlights the main character or topic of the sentence.

**English analogy:** English actually has remnants of nominative case in pronouns. We say "I did it" (not "me did it") and "he ran" (not "him ran"). The words "I" and "he" are nominative forms, while "me" and "him" are objective forms. Arabic applies this same principle to ALL nouns, not just pronouns, using vowel markers instead of word changes.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** The [nominative case](/resources/glossary/#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْعٌ) — literally meaning "raising" or "elevation" — is marked by specific endings that vary based on the noun's form.

### Nominative Markers by Noun Type

<GrammarTable>
| Noun Type | Nominative Marker | Example | Transliteration | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Singular (definite)** | damma (ـُ) | ٱلرَّجُلُ | ar-rajulu | the man |
| **Singular (indefinite)** | dammatain (ـٌ) | رَجُلٌ | rajulun | a man |
| **Dual** | alif + nun (ـَانِ) | رَجُلَانِ | rajulāni | two men |
| **Sound Masculine Plural** | waw + nun (ـُونَ) | مُسْلِمُونَ | muslimūna | Muslims (male) |
| **Sound Feminine Plural** | damma (ـُ) | مُسْلِمَاتُ | muslimātu | Muslims (female) |
| **Broken Plural** | damma/dammatain | رِجَالٌ | rijālun | men |
</GrammarTable>

**Key insight:** The specific marker varies, but they all serve the same grammatical function: marking the nominative case. Whether it's a simple damma or the complex ـُونَ ending, the case is still rafʿ.

## The Four Functions That Take Nominative Case

There are exactly FOUR grammatical functions that trigger nominative case in Arabic. Master these four, and you'll know when to apply rafʿ every time.

### Function 1: Subject of Nominal Sentence (Mubtadaʾ)

The [subject of a nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) ALWAYS takes nominative case. This is the topic you're making a statement about.

**Example:**
- **ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ** (allāhu aḥadun) — "Allah is One"
  - ٱللَّهُ (allāhu): mubtadaʾ in nominative (damma ـُ)

**Rule:** Mubtadaʾ = nominative, no exceptions.

### Function 2: Predicate of Nominal Sentence (Khabar)

The [predicate of a nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#khabar) (khabar / خَبَرٌ) also takes nominative case. This is the information you're stating about the topic.

**Example:**
- **ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ** (allāhu aḥadun) — "Allah is One"
  - أَحَدٌ (aḥadun): khabar in nominative (dammatain ـٌ)

**Rule:** Khabar = nominative (in basic nominal sentences without modifying particles).

**Exception to learn later:** Particles like إِنَّ and verbs like كَانَ modify this rule. You'll study these in [L2.10](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/) and [L2.11](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/).

### Function 3: Subject of Verbal Sentence (Fāʿil)

The [subject of a verbal sentence](/resources/glossary/#fail) (fāʿil / فَاعِلٌ) — the doer of the action — takes nominative case.

**Example:**
- **جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ** (jāʾa naṣru llāhi) — "Allah's help came"
  - نَصْرُ (naṣru): fāʿil in nominative (damma ـُ)

**Rule:** Fāʿil = nominative, always comes after the verb.

**Word order:** In Arabic verbal sentences, the typical order is Verb → Subject (fāʿil) → Object. The nominative case on the subject helps you identify it even if word order varies.

### Function 4: Coordinated Nouns

When two or more nouns are joined by وَ (wa) "and," they take the SAME case. If the first noun is nominative (for any of the three reasons above), the coordinated noun also takes nominative.

**Example:**
- **إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ** (idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wa-l-fatḥu) — "When Allah's help and the victory come"
  - نَصْرُ (naṣru): fāʿil in nominative (damma ـُ)
  - ٱلْفَتْحُ (al-fatḥu): coordinated with نَصْرُ, also nominative (damma ـُ)

**Rule:** Coordinated nouns match case. If A is nominative, then "A and B" means B is also nominative.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Surah An-Nasr (110), which demonstrates all four nominative functions in just three short verses.

### Example 1: Fāʿil (Subject of Verbal Sentence)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ"
  transliteration="idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wa-l-fatḥu"
  translation="When the help of Allah and the victory comes"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:1"
  highlight="نَصْرُ,ٱلْفَتْحُ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِذَا", tr: "idhā", en: "when" },
    { ar: "جَآءَ", tr: "jāʾa", en: "comes" },
    { ar: "نَصْرُ", tr: "naṣru", en: "help" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "of Allah" },
    { ar: "وَٱلْفَتْحُ", tr: "wa-l-fatḥu", en: "and the victory" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِذَا** (idhā) — Conditional particle — "when"
  - Function: Introduces conditional clause
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Time/conditional particle

- **جَآءَ** (jāʾa) — Verb — "comes"
  - Function: Past tense verb meaning "came"
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Reason: Action verb in past tense

- **نَصْرُ** (naṣru) — Subject (fāʿil) — "help"
  - Function: Subject of the verb جَآءَ (what came)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject of verbal sentence always takes nominative

- **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi) — Possessive (muḍāf ilayh) — "of Allah"
  - Function: Second part of possessive construction ("help OF Allah")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Second noun in iḍāfah takes genitive case

- **وَٱلْفَتْحُ** (wa-l-fatḥu) — Coordinated subject — "and the victory"
  - **وَ** (wa): Conjunction "and"
  - **ٱلْفَتْحُ** (al-fatḥu): Coordinated with نَصْرُ
  - Function: Second subject coordinated with first
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Coordinated with nominative noun, takes same case

**Structural insight:** This verse has TWO subjects (نَصْرُ and ٱلْفَتْحُ) for one verb (جَآءَ). Both subjects take nominative case because:
1. نَصْرُ is the fāʿil (Function 3)
2. ٱلْفَتْحُ is coordinated with نَصْرُ (Function 4)

### Example 2: More Fāʿil with Plural Subject

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَرَأَيْتَ ٱلنَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًۭا"
  transliteration="wa raʾayta n-nāsa yadkhulūna fī dīni llāhi afwājan"
  translation="And you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:2"
  highlight="ٱلنَّاسَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَرَأَيْتَ", tr: "wa raʾayta", en: "and you see" },
    { ar: "ٱلنَّاسَ", tr: "n-nāsa", en: "the people" },
    { ar: "يَدْخُلُونَ", tr: "yadkhulūna", en: "entering" },
    { ar: "فِى", tr: "fī", en: "into" },
    { ar: "دِينِ", tr: "dīni", en: "religion" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "of Allah" },
    { ar: "أَفْوَاجًۭا", tr: "afwājan", en: "in multitudes" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَرَأَيْتَ** (wa raʾayta) — Verb with pronoun — "and you see"
  - **وَ** (wa): Conjunction
  - **رَأَيْتَ** (raʾayta): Past tense verb "you saw" with attached pronoun تَ (you)
  - Function: Main verb
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Reason: Past tense verb with second-person pronoun suffix

- **ٱلنَّاسَ** (an-nāsa) — Direct object — "the people"
  - Function: Object of the verb رَأَيْتَ (what you saw)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: Direct object takes accusative case (NOT nominative!)

- **يَدْخُلُونَ** (yadkhulūna) — Present tense verb — "entering"
  - Function: Describes the state of ٱلنَّاسَ (present participle-like function)
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Reason: Present tense verb; the ـُونَ ending is the plural verb form, not a case marker

- **فِى** (fī) — Preposition — "into"
  - Function: Preposition meaning "in/into"
  - Case: Particles don't take case

- **دِينِ** (dīni) — Genitive after preposition — "religion"
  - Function: Object of preposition فِى
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: After preposition (genitive, not nominative)

- **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi) — Possessive — "of Allah"
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah ("religion OF Allah")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Second noun in possessive construction

- **أَفْوَاجًۭا** (afwājan) — Circumstantial accusative — "in multitudes"
  - Function: Describes the manner (in multitudes/groups)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: Circumstantial expression takes accusative

**Key lesson:** Notice ٱلنَّاسَ has fatha (accusative), NOT damma (nominative). Why? Because it's the OBJECT of the verb رَأَيْتَ, not the subject. Only subjects take nominative — objects take accusative.

### Example 3: Fāʿil as Hidden Pronoun

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ"
  transliteration="fa sabbiḥ bi-ḥamdi rabbika wa-staghfirhu"
  translation="Then exalt [Allah] with praise of your Lord and ask forgiveness of Him"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:3"
  words={[
    { ar: "فَسَبِّحْ", tr: "fa sabbiḥ", en: "then exalt" },
    { ar: "بِحَمْدِ", tr: "bi-ḥamdi", en: "with praise" },
    { ar: "رَبِّكَ", tr: "rabbika", en: "of your Lord" },
    { ar: "وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ", tr: "wa-staghfirhu", en: "and ask His forgiveness" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **فَسَبِّحْ** (fa sabbiḥ) — Command verb — "then exalt"
  - **فَ** (fa): Conjunction "then/so"
  - **سَبِّحْ** (sabbiḥ): Imperative verb "exalt/glorify"
  - Function: Command form
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Hidden subject (fāʿil): أَنْتَ (you) — implied in the verb form
  - **The hidden pronoun takes nominative case grammatically** (though it's not written)

- **بِحَمْدِ** (bi-ḥamdi) — Prepositional phrase — "with praise"
  - **بِ** (bi): Preposition "with/by"
  - **حَمْدِ** (ḥamdi): Genitive with kasra (ـِ) after preposition

- **رَبِّكَ** (rabbika) — Possessive — "of your Lord"
  - Function: "Your Lord" — second part of iḍāfah
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ) + possessive suffix كَ
  - Reason: Second noun in possessive construction

- **وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ** (wa-staghfirhu) — Command verb with object — "and ask His forgiveness"
  - **وَ** (wa): Conjunction "and"
  - **ٱسْتَغْفِرْ** (istaghfir): Imperative verb "ask forgiveness"
  - **هُ** (hu): Attached pronoun "Him" (direct object, accusative)
  - Hidden subject (fāʿil): أَنْتَ (you) in nominative

**Advanced concept:** In imperative and present tense verbs, the subject is often HIDDEN (mustatir). The pronoun isn't written, but grammatically it exists and takes nominative case. The verb ending tells you who the hidden subject is.

### Example 4: Mubtadaʾ and Khabar (From Al-Ikhlas)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="Allah is the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="ٱللَّهُ,ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱللَّهُ", tr: "allāhu", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "ٱلصَّمَدُ", tr: "aṣ-ṣamadu", en: "the Eternal Refuge" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — Subject (mubtadaʾ) — "Allah"
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Mubtadaʾ always takes nominative (Function 1)

- **ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu) — Predicate (khabar) — "the Eternal Refuge"
  - Function: Predicate describing Allah
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Khabar takes nominative in basic nominal sentences (Function 2)

**Both nominative:** This demonstrates Functions 1 and 2 — both the subject and predicate of a nominal sentence take nominative case.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="When Nouns Take Nominative Case">

The [nominative case](/resources/glossary/#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْعٌ) applies in exactly FOUR situations:

1. **Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ)**
   - The topic being discussed in a sentence that begins with a noun
   - Example: **ٱللَّهُ** رَحِيمٌ — Allah (is) Merciful

2. **Predicate of nominal sentence (khabar / خَبَرٌ)**
   - The information about the subject (without modifying particles)
   - Example: ٱللَّهُ **رَحِيمٌ** — Allah (is) Merciful

3. **Subject of verbal sentence (fāʿil / فَاعِلٌ)**
   - The doer of the action in a sentence beginning with a verb
   - Example: جَآءَ **نَصْرُ** ٱللَّهِ — Allah's help came

4. **Coordinated nouns (maʿṭūf / مَعْطُوف)**
   - Nouns joined with وَ "and" that follow a nominative noun
   - Example: جَآءَ **نَصْرُ** ٱللَّهِ **وَٱلْفَتْحُ** — Allah's help and the victory came

**Nominative markers:**
- Singular: damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)
- Dual: ـَانِ
- Sound masculine plural: ـُونَ
- Sound feminine plural: ـَاتُ / ـُ
- Broken plurals: damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)

- [L2.05: The Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case/) — When nouns take naṣb
- [L2.06: The Genitive Case](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/) — When nouns take jarr

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't confuse nominative verb endings with nominative case.** The ـُونَ ending on يَدْخُلُونَ (yadkhulūna) looks like the nominative plural marker, but it's a VERB ENDING, not a case marker. Only NOUNS take case. Verbs have their own system of mood markers (you'll learn this in Level 3).

**Don't assume every subject is nominative.** After the particle إِنَّ (inna), the subject shifts to accusative case. You'll study this exception in [L2.10](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/). For now, remember: basic nominal sentences have nominative subjects, but particles can modify this rule.

**Don't forget coordinated nouns match case.** If you see وَ joining two nouns and the first is nominative, the second MUST also be nominative. This agreement is automatic and required.

**Don't apply nominative to objects.** The direct object of a verb takes ACCUSATIVE case (naṣb), not nominative. In the sentence قَرَأَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْكِتَابَ (the student read the book), ٱلطَّالِبُ is nominative (subject) but ٱلْكِتَابَ is accusative (object). Position in the sentence matters!

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify all nominative nouns in this verse and state which function (1-4) applies: وَجَآءَ رَبُّكَ وَٱلْمَلَكُ صَفًّا صَفًّا (wa jāʾa rabbuka wa-l-malaku ṣaffan ṣaffan) — 'And your Lord comes and the angels, row upon row' [Al-Fajr 89:22]">

**Answer:**

**Nominative nouns:**

1. **رَبُّكَ** (rabbuka) — "your Lord"
   - Function: **Function 3** — Subject of verbal sentence (fāʿil)
   - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ) (hidden under possessive كَ)
   - Reason: Subject of the verb جَآءَ (jāʾa) "came"

2. **ٱلْمَلَكُ** (al-malaku) — "the angels"
   - Function: **Function 4** — Coordinated noun
   - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
   - Reason: Coordinated with رَبُّكَ via وَ, matches its nominative case

**Not nominative:**

- **صَفًّا صَفًّا** (ṣaffan ṣaffan) — "row upon row"
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: Circumstantial accusative (ḥāl) describing the manner

**Complete iʿrāb:**

- جَآءَ (jāʾa): Past tense verb "came"
- رَبُّكَ (rabbuka): Fāʿil, nominative (Function 3)
- وَٱلْمَلَكُ (wa-l-malaku): Coordinated fāʿil, nominative (Function 4)
- صَفًّا صَفًّا: Circumstantial accusative (not nominative)

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Explain why ٱلْإِنسَانُ is nominative in this verse: إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ (inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin) — 'Indeed, mankind is in loss' [Al-ʿAsr 103:2]. Then explain the apparent contradiction.">

**Answer:**

**Wait — there's a problem!**

**ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ (al-insāna) is NOT nominative** in this verse. It's ACCUSATIVE!

**Complete analysis:**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Particle
  - Function: Emphasis particle "indeed/verily"
  - Effect: Puts the subject of nominal sentence into ACCUSATIVE case

- **ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ** (al-insāna) — Subject (ism inna)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence modified by إِنَّ
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: إِنَّ is a special particle that changes the subject from nominative to accusative

- **لَفِى** (la-fī) — Prepositional phrase
  - **لَ** (la): Emphatic particle
  - **فِى** (fī): Preposition "in"
  - Function: Predicate (khabar inna)

- **خُسْرٍ** (khusrin) — Genitive
  - Function: Object of preposition فِى
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasratain (ـٍ)
  - Reason: After preposition

**The key exception:** إِنَّ and its sisters (inna wa akhawātuhā) are special particles that MODIFY the normal nominative case rule. Without إِنَّ, this would be:

**ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ لَفِى خُسْرٍ** (al-insānu la-fī khusrin)
- ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ: Mubtadaʾ, **nominative** with damma (ـُ)

With إِنَّ:
**إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ**
- ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ: Ism inna, **accusative** with fatha (ـَ)

**You'll master this exception in [L2.10](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/).** For now, remember: إِنَّ is one of the few particles that can override the nominative case rule for subjects.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Perform complete iʿrāb on this sentence, identifying all four nominative functions: ٱلْعِلْمُ نُورٌ وَٱلْجَهْلُ ظُلْمَةٌ (al-ʿilmu nūrun wa-l-jahlu ẓulmatun) — 'Knowledge is light and ignorance is darkness'">

**Answer:**

**First nominal sentence:**

- **ٱلْعِلْمُ** (al-ʿilmu) — "knowledge"
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: **Function 1** — Subject of nominal sentence
  - Nominative function: ✓

- **نُورٌ** (nūrun) — "a light"
  - Function: Predicate of nominal sentence (khabar)
  - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
  - Reason: **Function 2** — Predicate of nominal sentence
  - Nominative function: ✓

**Second nominal sentence (coordinated):**

- **وَٱلْجَهْلُ** (wa-l-jahlu) — "and ignorance"
  - **وَ** (wa): Conjunction "and"
  - **ٱلْجَهْلُ** (al-jahlu): Subject of second nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ)
  - Function: Subject of coordinated nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: **Function 1** — Subject of nominal sentence
  - Also **Function 4** — Coordinated with first sentence structure
  - Nominative function: ✓

- **ظُلْمَةٌ** (ẓulmatun) — "darkness"
  - Function: Predicate of second nominal sentence (khabar)
  - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
  - Reason: **Function 2** — Predicate of nominal sentence
  - Nominative function: ✓

**Summary:**
- **Function 1** (mubtadaʾ): ٱلْعِلْمُ, ٱلْجَهْلُ
- **Function 2** (khabar): نُورٌ, ظُلْمَةٌ
- **Function 3** (fāʿil): Not present (no verbal sentences)
- **Function 4** (coordinated): ٱلْجَهْلُ (also Function 1)

All four words are nominative, demonstrating the parallel structure of two nominal sentences joined by وَ.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Advanced — In the verse 'إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ' (idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wa-l-fatḥu), explain why نَصْرُ is nominative but ٱللَّهِ is genitive, even though they're right next to each other.">

**Answer:**

**The key is understanding the possessive construction (iḍāfah):**

- **نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ** (naṣru llāhi) is a two-word possessive phrase meaning "Allah's help" or "the help OF Allah"

**First word (muḍāf):**
- **نَصْرُ** (naṣru) — "help"
  - Function: Subject of the verb جَآءَ (fāʿil)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Function 3 — Subject of verbal sentence takes nominative
  - **The FIRST word in iḍāfah keeps whatever case the sentence requires**

**Second word (muḍāf ilayh):**
- **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi) — "Allah" (OF Allah)
  - Function: Second part of possessive construction
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: **The SECOND word in iḍāfah ALWAYS takes genitive case** (rule of possession)
  - This genitive case is REQUIRED by the iḍāfah structure, regardless of the first word's case

**The principle:**
1. نَصْرُ is nominative because it's the SUBJECT (fāʿil) — Function 3
2. ٱللَّهِ is genitive because it's the SECOND WORD in iḍāfah — different grammatical relationship

**Analogy:** In English "Allah's help," the possessive 's shows the relationship. In Arabic, the genitive case on ٱللَّهِ shows the possession, while the nominative on نَصْرُ shows its role as subject.

**Two simultaneous grammatical rules:**
- نَصْرُ: Governed by its role in the SENTENCE (subject → nominative)
- ٱللَّهِ: Governed by its position in the PHRASE (second in iḍāfah → genitive)
