## Introduction

You've completed Level 2 — every major grammatical tool from nominal sentences to inna and kaana sisters is now in your toolkit. This checkpoint puts all of those skills to work on a real, complete surah. Surah Al-Kawthar (108) is the shortest surah in the Quran: just three verses and ten words. But those ten words contain an extraordinary density of grammar — inna constructions, verbal sentences, imperatives, prepositions, possessive constructions, and all three cases.

Read through the surah first, then follow the guided analysis verse by verse.

### The Full Surah

    { ar: "ٱلْأَبْتَرُ", tr: "al-abtar", en: "the cut off" }
  ]}
/>

Now let's break down every word using the tools you've learned across Levels 1 and 2.

## Guided Analysis: Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you Al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="إِنَّآ,ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّآ", tr: "innā", en: "indeed We" },
    { ar: "أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ", tr: "aʿṭaynāka", en: "have granted you" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَوْثَرَ", tr: "al-kawthar", en: "Al-Kawthar (abundance)" }
  ]}
/>

This verse opens with إِنَّ — the emphasis particle you studied in [L2.10 Inna and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/). Let's parse each element:

**Word-by-word grammatical analysis:**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle — "indeed"
  - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Opens an emphasized statement

- **ـآ / نَا** (nā) — Attached pronoun "We" (divine plural)
  - Function: Name of inna (ism inna) — this pronoun is the subject
  - Case marker: **Accusative** (attached pronouns have fixed forms, but grammatically this is ism inna in accusative position)
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative case
  - Note: The pronoun attaches directly to إِنَّ, forming the single written word إِنَّا

- **أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ** (aʿṭaynāka) — Verb "We gave you" — past tense
  - Function: Part of the predicate of inna (khabar inna) — a verbal sentence
  - Contains two attached pronouns: نَا (nā, "we" — the doer) and ـكَ (ka, "you" — the recipient)
  - The entire verbal sentence أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ serves as the khabar

- **ٱلْكَوْثَرَ** (al-kawthar) — Noun, definite (has ٱلْ), meaning "abundance"
  - Function: Direct object (mafʿūl bihi) of the verb أَعْطَى
  - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
  - Reason: Direct objects take the accusative case ([L2.05](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case/))

**Sentence type:** This is an **inna construction** containing a **verbal sentence** as its predicate. The overall structure is:

```
إِنَّ + SUBJECT (acc.) + VERBAL SENTENCE (khabar)
إِنَّ     نَا              أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ
```

**Case summary:** Two accusatives in this verse — نَا (ism inna, accusative) and ٱلْكَوْثَرَ (direct object, accusative) — but for different reasons. This is a key insight: the same case ending can serve different grammatical functions.

## Guided Analysis: Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
  highlight="لِرَبِّكَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "فَصَلِّ", tr: "fa-ṣalli", en: "so pray" },
    { ar: "لِرَبِّكَ", tr: "li-rabbika", en: "to your Lord" },
    { ar: "وَٱنْحَرْ", tr: "wa-nḥar", en: "and sacrifice" }
  ]}
/>

This verse shifts from a statement to a pair of **commands**. It also gives us a clear example of preposition + genitive and possessive construction.

**Word-by-word grammatical analysis:**

- **فَ** (fa) — Result/consequence particle — "so, therefore"
  - Function: Particle connecting this verse to verse 1 as a logical consequence
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Meaning: "Because We gave you Al-Kawthar, THEREFORE do this..."

- **صَلِّ** (ṣalli) — Verb, imperative — "pray!"
  - Function: Main verb of the first command
  - This is an imperative (command form) — you'll study verb forms in detail in Level 3
  - Sentence type: **Verbal sentence**

- **لِ** (li) — Preposition — "to, for"
  - Function: Preposition ([L2.07 Prepositions and Genitive](/learn/level-2/07-prepositions-genitive/))
  - What follows must be **genitive** case

- **رَبِّ** (rabbi) — Noun — "Lord"
  - Function: Object of preposition لِ
  - Case marker: **Genitive** (visible as kasra on the base form, though here the attached pronoun replaces the tanwin)
  - Reason: Nouns after prepositions take genitive case ([L2.07](/learn/level-2/07-prepositions-genitive/))

- **ـكَ** (ka) — Attached pronoun — "your"
  - Function: Possessive pronoun, second term of a possessive construction
  - The combination رَبِّكَ (rabbika, "your Lord") is a possessive construction ([L2.08 Possessive/Idafah](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/)) where the pronoun ـكَ functions like the second noun in an idafah

- **وَ** (wa) — Conjunction particle — "and"
  - Function: Joins the two commands together

- **ٱنْحَرْ** (inḥar) — Verb, imperative — "sacrifice!"
  - Function: Main verb of the second command
  - Sentence type: **Verbal sentence** (second command)

**Sentence type:** Two **verbal sentences** (commands) joined by وَ. The فَ at the beginning links both commands as a consequence of the blessing described in verse 1.

**Structures demonstrated:**
- Preposition + genitive: لِرَبِّكَ — لِ triggers genitive on رَبّ ([L2.07](/learn/level-2/07-prepositions-genitive/))
- Possessive construction: رَبِّكَ — "your Lord" — noun + attached pronoun ([L2.08](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/))

## Guided Analysis: Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
  transliteration="inna shāniʾaka huwa l-abtar"
  translation="Indeed, your enemy — it is he who is cut off"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:3"
  highlight="إِنَّ,شَانِئَكَ,ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّ", tr: "inna", en: "indeed" },
    { ar: "شَانِئَكَ", tr: "shāniʾaka", en: "your enemy (hater)" },
    { ar: "هُوَ", tr: "huwa", en: "he" },
    { ar: "ٱلْأَبْتَرُ", tr: "al-abtar", en: "the cut off" }
  ]}
/>

The surah closes with another إِنَّ construction — mirroring verse 1. This time, the predicate is a **nominal expression** rather than a verbal sentence.

**Word-by-word grammatical analysis:**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle — "indeed"
  - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family (same as verse 1)
  - Case: Particles don't take case

- **شَانِئَ** (shāniʾa) — Active participle meaning "hater, enemy"
  - Function: Name of inna (ism inna) — subject
  - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative case
  - Grammar note: شَانِئ is an active participle (a noun derived from a verb — you'll study these in Level 3). For now, recognize it as a noun meaning "one who hates"

- **ـكَ** (ka) — Attached pronoun — "your"
  - Function: Possessive pronoun — second term of a possessive construction
  - The combination شَانِئَكَ (shāniʾaka, "your hater/enemy") is a possessive construction ([L2.08](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/))
  - The pronoun tells us WHO is hated — "the one who hates YOU"

- **هُوَ** (huwa) — Separating pronoun — "he"
  - Function: Separating pronoun (ḍamīr al-faṣl) placed between subject and predicate for emphasis
  - This is not the grammatical subject — it's an emphatic device meaning "he, specifically, is..."
  - It separates the ism inna from the khabar inna, adding rhetorical force

- **ٱلْأَبْتَرُ** (al-abtar) — Definite noun/adjective meaning "the cut off, the one with no legacy"
  - Function: Predicate of inna (khabar inna)
  - Case marker: **Nominative with damma (ـُ)**
  - Reason: Predicate of إِنَّ remains nominative

**Sentence type:** **Inna construction with a nominal predicate.** Compare this to verse 1, where the khabar was a verbal sentence. Here, the khabar is a single definite noun (ٱلْأَبْتَرُ).

**Sentence structure:**
```
إِنَّ + SUBJECT (acc.) + SEPARATING PRONOUN + PREDICATE (nom.)
إِنَّ    شَانِئَكَ           هُوَ              ٱلْأَبْتَرُ
```

**Structural insight:** Both verse 1 and verse 3 begin with إِنَّ, creating a powerful rhetorical frame. The first إِنَّ announces a blessing; the final إِنَّ announces the fate of the enemy. The grammar mirrors the meaning.

## Skills Demonstrated

Every major concept from Levels 1 and 2 appears in these ten words. Here's a summary of what you've just applied:

<GrammarTable>
| Skill | Lesson | Where in Al-Kawthar |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| **Word types** (noun, verb, particle) | [L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-word-types/) | All three types identified: nouns (ٱلْكَوْثَرَ, رَبّ, شَانِئَ, ٱلْأَبْتَرُ), verbs (أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ, صَلِّ, ٱنْحَرْ), particles (إِنَّ, فَ, لِ, وَ) |
| **Nominal sentences** | [L2.01](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/) | Verse 3: إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ (nominal predicate within inna) |
| **Verbal sentences** | [L2.03](/learn/level-2/03-verbal-sentence/) | Verses 1-2: أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ, صَلِّ, ٱنْحَرْ |
| **Nominative case** | [L2.04](/learn/level-2/04-nominative-case/) | ٱلْأَبْتَرُ — khabar inna, nominative with damma |
| **Accusative case** | [L2.05](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case/) | ٱلْكَوْثَرَ — direct object; شَانِئَكَ — ism inna |
| **Genitive case** | [L2.06](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/) | رَبِّكَ — after preposition لِ |
| **Prepositions + genitive** | [L2.07](/learn/level-2/07-prepositions-genitive/) | لِرَبِّكَ — preposition لِ triggers genitive on رَبّ |
| **Possessive construction** | [L2.08](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/) | رَبِّكَ ("your Lord"), شَانِئَكَ ("your hater") |
| **Inna construction** | [L2.10](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/) | Verse 1: إِنَّا ... ٱلْكَوْثَرَ; Verse 3: إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ ... ٱلْأَبْتَرُ |
</GrammarTable>

All three cases — nominative, accusative, and genitive — appear in a surah of only ten words. This is the precision of Quranic Arabic: every ending carries meaning.

## What's Coming Next

<Callout type="tip">
**Preview of Levels 3-5:**

There are several things in this surah that your current toolkit doesn't yet fully explain. That's by design — each level opens new doors:

- **Level 3 (Verb Conjugation):** You'll learn why أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ has that specific form — how Arabic verbs encode "we" (نَا), past tense, and "you" (كَ) all within a single word. You'll also learn why the imperatives صَلِّ and ٱنْحَرْ look the way they do.

- **Level 3 (Active Participles):** You'll understand why شَانِئ means "one who hates" — it's an active participle, a noun pattern derived from a verb that describes someone performing an action.

- **Level 5 (Rhetorical Analysis):** You'll explore why the surah opens and closes with إِنَّ, how the structure mirrors blessing against curse, and what the separating pronoun هُوَ adds to the rhetoric of verse 3.

For now, celebrate what you CAN analyze — and notice how much of the Quran's grammar is already within your reach.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify Ism and Khabar of Inna">
There are two إِنَّ constructions in Surah Al-Kawthar. For each one, identify the ism inna (subject) and khabar inna (predicate), and state their cases.

1. **Verse 1:** إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ
2. **Verse 3:** إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ


**Verse 1:**
- **Ism inna (subject):** نَا (nā) — the attached pronoun "We," joined to إِنَّ as إِنَّا
  - Case: **Accusative** (attached pronouns have fixed forms; this is grammatically in accusative position as ism inna)
- **Khabar inna (predicate):** أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ — the entire verbal sentence "We granted you Al-Kawthar"
  - Type: Verbal sentence serving as khabar

**Verse 3:**
- **Ism inna (subject):** شَانِئَكَ (shāniʾaka) — "your enemy/hater"
  - Case: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)** — visible on the ending of شَانِئَ
- **Khabar inna (predicate):** ٱلْأَبْتَرُ (al-abtar) — "the cut off"
  - Case: **Nominative with damma (ـُ)** — predicate of inna remains nominative

**Key insight:** Both inna constructions follow the same rule (accusative subject, nominative predicate), but they have different predicate types: verse 1 uses a verbal sentence as khabar, verse 3 uses a single definite noun. The هُوَ in verse 3 is a separating pronoun for emphasis, not part of the ism or khabar.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Find All Genitive Words">
Find every word in the surah that is in genitive case (majrūr). For each one, explain WHY it is genitive.


There are two genitive words in the surah, both in verse 2:

1. **رَبِّ** (rabbi) in لِرَبِّكَ (li-rabbika) — "your Lord"
   - Case: **Genitive** with kasra on the base form
   - Reason: It follows the preposition لِ (li, "to/for"). Nouns after prepositions take genitive case ([L2.07](/learn/level-2/07-prepositions-genitive/)).

2. **ـكَ** (ka) in رَبِّكَ — "your"
   - Function: Attached possessive pronoun functioning as the second part of a possessive construction
   - Reason: In a possessive construction (idafah), the second element is genitive ([L2.08](/learn/level-2/08-possessive-idafah/)). Although attached pronouns have fixed visible forms, this pronoun occupies the genitive position grammatically.

**Note:** The ـكَ in شَانِئَكَ (verse 3) also occupies a genitive position within the possessive construction شَانِئ + كَ. The same rule applies: the second element of a possessive construction is genitive.

**Key insight:** Every genitive in this surah is triggered either by a preposition or by a possessive construction — exactly the two causes of genitive case you learned in Levels 2.07 and 2.08.
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Identify All Attached Pronouns">
Find every attached pronoun in the surah. For each one, state: (1) what the pronoun is, (2) what it means, and (3) what it refers to or what word it attaches to.


There are five attached pronouns in Surah Al-Kawthar:

**Verse 1:** إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ

1. **نَا** (nā) in إِنَّا — "We"
   - Meaning: First person plural (divine "We")
   - Attaches to: إِنَّ (inna particle)
   - Function: Ism inna (subject of inna construction) — refers to Allah

2. **نَا** (nā) in أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ — "We"
   - Meaning: First person plural (divine "We")
   - Attaches to: The verb أَعْطَى (aʿṭā, "gave")
   - Function: Subject/doer of the verb — refers to Allah

3. **كَ** (ka) in أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ — "you"
   - Meaning: Second person masculine singular "you"
   - Attaches to: The verb أَعْطَى
   - Function: Indirect recipient of the giving — refers to the Prophet Muhammad

**Verse 2:** فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ

4. **كَ** (ka) in رَبِّكَ — "your"
   - Meaning: Second person masculine singular "your"
   - Attaches to: The noun رَبّ (rabb, "Lord")
   - Function: Possessive pronoun in idafah construction — refers to the Prophet Muhammad

**Verse 3:** إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ

5. **كَ** (ka) in شَانِئَكَ — "your"
   - Meaning: Second person masculine singular "your"
   - Attaches to: The noun شَانِئ (shāniʾ, "hater")
   - Function: Possessive pronoun in idafah construction — refers to the Prophet Muhammad

**Key insight:** Three of the five pronouns refer to the Prophet Muhammad (all ـكَ), and two refer to Allah (both نَا). Notice how Arabic packs entire relationships — who is acting, who is receiving, who possesses — into single-word constructions through attached pronouns.

All three cases, all three word types, and multiple grammatical constructions — in just ten words.
</ExerciseBox>

## Summary

You have just analyzed a complete surah of the Quran using nothing but the grammar you learned in Levels 1 and 2. Ten words. Three verses. Every tool in your toolkit deployed — word types, sentence types, all three cases, prepositions, possessive constructions, and inna.

Here is what you demonstrated:

- **Inna constructions** in verses 1 and 3, with two different predicate types (verbal sentence vs. nominal)
- **All three cases** in action — nominative for khabar inna, accusative for ism inna and direct objects, genitive after prepositions and in possessive constructions
- **Verbal and nominal sentence patterns** side by side
- **Five attached pronouns** carrying meaning about who acts, who receives, and who possesses

Level 2 is complete. You now have the foundational grammar to begin reading the Quran analytically. Level 3 will add verb conjugation, derived noun patterns, and more — giving you the tools to understand not just sentence structure but the internal mechanics of each word.
