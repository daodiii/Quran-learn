## Introduction

You've mastered the [nominal sentence](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence) structure — two nouns in nominative case describing a state of being. Now meet its counterpart: the verbal sentence, where ACTION takes center stage.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have given you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ,ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
/>

The clause "أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ" (aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar) is a perfect [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة). It begins with a verb (أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ "We gave"), establishing WHAT HAPPENED before identifying WHO did it. This verb-first structure is the defining characteristic of Arabic verbal sentences.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Define a [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة) as beginning with a verb
- Understand the three essential components: verb (fiʿl), subject (fāʿil), and object (mafʿūl bihi)
- Master VSO (Verb-Subject-Object) word order as Arabic's default pattern
- Identify verbal sentences in Quranic verses and distinguish them from nominal sentences
- Recognize embedded subjects within verb conjugations

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L1.10 Simple Sentences](/learn/level-1/10-simple-sentences), you learned to identify sentence types by their first word. In [L2.01 Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence), you studied sentences that describe states of being. Now you'll explore sentences that describe ACTIONS — and discover why Arabic prefers to announce WHAT HAPPENED before revealing WHO did it.

**Critical contrast:**
- **Nominal sentence:** States being/existence → ٱللَّهُ رَحِيمٌ "Allah is Merciful"
- **Verbal sentence:** Expresses action/event → خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ "Allah created"

## Understanding the Verbal Sentence

**Plain English first:** A verbal sentence is like a news headline that leads with the action: "DONATED — Bill Gates — millions to charity." Instead of saying "Bill Gates donated...", you announce the action FIRST, then reveal who did it. This creates immediacy and emphasizes the event itself.

**English analogy:** English occasionally uses this pattern for dramatic effect: "Came the dawn," "Spoke the oracle," "Fell the hero." Arabic makes this the STANDARD pattern for action sentences. It's not unusual or poetic — it's the natural way to describe what happened.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** A [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة) consists of:

1. **[Verb](/resources/glossary#fil)** (fiʿl / فِعْلٌ) — The action or event (MUST come first)
2. **[Subject/Doer](/resources/glossary#fail)** (fāʿil / فَاعِلٌ) — Who or what performed the action (comes after verb)
3. **[Object](/resources/glossary#mafool)** (mafʿūl bihi / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ) — What received the action (if the verb is transitive)

### The Key Insight: Verb-First Word Order (VSO)

Arabic's default word order for action sentences is **Verb → Subject → Object** (VSO), different from English's Subject-Verb-Object (SVO):

**Arabic VSO:**
- **خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ** (khalaqa llāhu s-samāwāti)
- Created + Allah + the heavens
- "Allah created the heavens"

**English SVO:**
- Allah + created + the heavens

**Why VSO matters:** The verb-first position emphasizes the ACTION itself. This is why Quranic narratives often begin with verbs — "Qāla" (He said), "Ja'a" (He came), "Nazala" (It descended) — creating narrative momentum.

### The Three Components in Detail

<GrammarTable>
| Component | Arabic Term | Grammatical Case | Position | Example |
|-----------|-------------|------------------|----------|---------|
| **Verb** | فِعْلٌ (fiʿl) | No case (mood instead) | **First** | خَلَقَ (khalaqa) "created" |
| **Subject/Doer** | فَاعِلٌ (fāʿil) | Nominative (rafʿ) | After verb | ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) "Allah" |
| **Object** | مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ (mafʿūl bihi) | Accusative (naṣb) | After subject | ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ (as-samāwāti) "the heavens" |
</GrammarTable>

**Component 1: The Verb (Fiʿl)**

- **Must be FIRST** for the sentence to be verbal
- Indicates tense: past (māḍī), present (muḍāriʿ), or command (amr)
- Contains information about the subject (person, number, gender) in its conjugation
- Does NOT take case endings (verbs take mood instead: indicative, subjunctive, jussive)

**Component 2: The Subject (Fāʿil)**

- **The doer** of the action
- Always takes **nominative case** (rafʿ) — same as nominal sentence subject
- Can be explicit (stated noun) or embedded (hidden pronoun within verb)
- When explicit, typically comes immediately after the verb

**Component 3: The Object (Mafʿūl Bihi)**

- **What receives** the action
- Always takes **accusative case** (naṣb)
- Only present with transitive verbs (verbs that can take an object)
- Position: typically after the subject, but can vary for emphasis

### Embedded Subjects (Hidden Pronouns)

Arabic verbs encode the subject within their conjugation. This means the subject is often HIDDEN inside the verb:

**Examples:**
- **كَتَبَ** (kataba) — "He wrote" (subject "he" is embedded in the verb form)
- **كَتَبَتْ** (katabat) — "She wrote" (the ت ending signals "she")
- **كَتَبُوا۟** (katabū) — "They wrote" (the وْا ending signals "they-masculine")

When the subject is embedded, the verbal sentence contains only the verb (with hidden subject) and possibly an object:

- **كَتَبَ ٱلْكِتَابَ** (kataba l-kitāba) — "(He) wrote the book"
  - Verb: كَتَبَ "wrote"
  - Subject: hidden pronoun "he" (هُوَ embedded in verb conjugation)
  - Object: ٱلْكِتَابَ "the book"

### Contrasting Nominal vs. Verbal Sentences

<GrammarTable>
| Feature | Nominal Sentence | Verbal Sentence |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| **Begins with** | Noun (or pronoun) | Verb |
| **Primary meaning** | State of being, description | Action, event |
| **Tense** | Present (timeless state) | Specified by verb tense |
| **Subject case** | Nominative (mubtadaʾ) | Nominative (fāʿil) |
| **Predicate case** | Nominative (khabar) | N/A (object is accusative) |
| **Example** | ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ "Allah is All-Knowing" | عَلِمَ ٱللَّهُ "Allah knew" |
</GrammarTable>

**Important distinction:** Not every sentence CONTAINING a verb is a verbal sentence. The sentence must BEGIN with a verb:

- ✅ **Verbal:** **خَلَقَ** ٱللَّهُ ٱلْإِنسَانَ — "Allah created mankind" (verb first)
- ❌ **Nominal:** ٱللَّهُ **خَلَقَ** ٱلْإِنسَانَ — "Allah — He created mankind" (noun first; verb is part of the predicate)

## Examples from the Quran

Let's analyze examples from Surah Al-Kawthar (108), demonstrating different verbal sentence structures and VSO word order.

### Example 1: Verb + Embedded Subject + Object

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have given you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ,ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِنَّا** (innā) — Emphasis particle + pronoun
  - Function: إِنَّ (emphasis particle) + نَا (attached pronoun "we")
  - Case marker: نَا is in accusative as name of إِنَّ (ism inna)
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative

The verbal sentence begins within the khabar of إِنَّ:

- **أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ** (aʿṭaynāka) — Verb with embedded subject and object pronoun
  - Function: Past tense verb (Form IV)
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case
  - Breakdown:
    - Root: ع-ط-ي (ʿayn-ṭa-ya) "to give"
    - أَعْطَى (aʿṭā) — Form IV verb "gave" (causative: made to have)
    - نَا — embedded subject pronoun "we" (first person plural)
    - كَ — attached object pronoun "you" (second person singular masculine)
  - Meaning: "We gave you"

- **ٱلْكَوْثَرَ** (al-kawthar) — Direct object
  - Function: Second object (mafʿūl bihi thānin)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: Direct object takes accusative case

**Structural insight:** This verb has TWO objects: (1) كَ "you" (attached pronoun) and (2) ٱلْكَوْثَرَ "al-Kawthar" (explicit noun). Form IV verbs often take two objects: "We gave YOU something" = "We gave something TO YOU."

**Word-by-word morphological breakdown of أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ:**

**أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ** (aʿṭaynāka):
- Root: ع-ط-ي (ʿayn-ṭa-ya)
- Form: Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern) — causative meaning
- Base verb: أَعْطَى (aʿṭā) "gave"
- Tense: Past tense (māḍī)
- Subject: نَا (first person plural "we") — embedded in conjugation
- Object: كَ (second person masculine singular "you") — attached pronoun
- Full meaning: "We gave you"

### Example 2: Verb + Explicit Subject (Imperative Command)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
  highlight="صَلِّ,ٱنْحَرْ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **فَ** (fa) — Conjunction
  - Function: Connective particle (consequence)
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Links this command to previous statement

- **صَلِّ** (ṣalli) — Imperative verb
  - Function: Command verb (amr)
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case (imperative mood)
  - Subject: Hidden pronoun "you" (أَنْتَ) — addressed person
  - Reason: Imperative commands the addressee
  - Root: ص-ل-و (ṣad-lam-waw) "to pray"

- **لِرَبِّكَ** (li-rabbika) — Prepositional phrase
  - Function: Specifies to whom prayer is directed
  - Case marker: لِ is preposition; رَبِّكَ is genitive with kasra (ـِ) + attached pronoun كَ
  - Reason: Prepositions trigger genitive case

- **وَ** (wa) — Coordinating conjunction
  - Function: Connects two commands
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Coordination

- **ٱنْحَرْ** (inḥar) — Second imperative verb
  - Function: Command verb (amr)
  - Case marker: Imperative mood (ending in sukūn)
  - Subject: Hidden pronoun "you" (أَنْتَ)
  - Root: ن-ح-ر (nun-ḥa-ra) "to sacrifice"
  - Meaning: "Sacrifice" (specifically: slaughter an animal by cutting the throat)

**Structural insight:** Both صَلِّ and ٱنْحَرْ are verbal sentences with EMBEDDED subjects. The subject "you" is understood from the imperative form — commanding the addressee. No explicit fāʿil appears because the verb conjugation already specifies who must act.

### Example 3: Verbal Sentence with Hidden Subject

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
  transliteration="inna shāniʾaka huwa l-abtar"
  translation="Indeed, your enemy - he is the one cut off"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:3"
  highlight="شَانِئَكَ,ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle
  - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Introduces emphasized nominal sentence

- **شَانِئَكَ** (shāniʾaka) — Name of inna (subject)
  - Function: Subject of إِنَّ (ism inna)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative
  - Form: Active participle (ism fāʿil) from Form I شَنَأَ "to hate"
  - Attached pronoun: كَ "your" (genitive possessive)
  - Meaning: "Your hater/enemy"

- **هُوَ** (huwa) — Pronoun (for emphasis)
  - Function: Pronoun of separation (ḍamīr al-faṣl)
  - Case marker: Pronouns don't visibly change for case
  - Reason: Emphasizes the predicate identification

- **ٱلْأَبْتَرُ** (al-abtar) — Predicate of inna
  - Function: Predicate (khabar inna)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Predicate of إِنَّ remains nominative
  - Meaning: "The one cut off" (without progeny or legacy)

**Advanced note:** This is a NOMINAL sentence structure modified by إِنَّ, not a verbal sentence. The active participle شَانِئَكَ ("your enemy" / "the one who hates you") is functioning as a noun here, not a verb. To be a verbal sentence, it would need to begin with a finite verb like يَشْنَأُكَ (yashnʾuka) "he hates you."

**Contrast:**
- **Nominal:** إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ "Indeed, your enemy is the cut-off one"
- **Verbal would be:** يَشْنَؤُكَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ "The cut-off one hates you"

### Example 4: Full VSO Structure Demonstration

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَرَأَيْتَ ٱلنَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًا"
  transliteration="wa raʾayta n-nāsa yadkhulūna fī dīni llāhi afwājan"
  translation="And you see the people entering into the religion of Allah in multitudes"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:2"
  highlight="رَأَيْتَ,ٱلنَّاسَ,يَدْخُلُونَ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَ** (wa) — Conjunction
  - Function: Coordinating conjunction
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Connects clauses

- **رَأَيْتَ** (raʾayta) — Verb with embedded subject
  - Function: Past tense verb
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case
  - Root: ر-ء-ي (ra-hamza-ya) "to see"
  - Subject: تَ — second person singular "you" (embedded)
  - Meaning: "You saw"

- **ٱلنَّاسَ** (an-nāsa) — Direct object
  - Function: First object (mafʿūl bihi)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: Direct object of رَأَيْتَ takes accusative

- **يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ** (yadkhulūna fī dīni llāhi) — Verbal sentence (حَال ḥāl clause)
  - Function: Describes the state of ٱلنَّاسَ
  - This is itself a verbal sentence embedded within the main sentence
  - **يَدْخُلُونَ** (yadkhulūna) — Present tense verb "they enter"
    - Subject: hidden pronoun "they" (referring to ٱلنَّاسَ)
  - **فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ** (fī dīni llāhi) — Prepositional phrase (where they enter)

- **أَفْوَاجًا** (afwājan) — Circumstantial adverb (حَالٌ ḥāl)
  - Function: Describes manner (how they enter)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: Adverbs of manner take accusative
  - Meaning: "In groups/multitudes"

**Structural insight:** This verse demonstrates VSO: **Verb** رَأَيْتَ (you saw) + **Subject** hidden "you" + **Object** ٱلنَّاسَ (the people). The embedded verbal sentence يَدْخُلُونَ is itself VSO structure nested within the main sentence.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Verbal Sentence Structure">

A [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة) expresses an action or event and has the following structure:

### Essential Components

**1. Verb (Fiʿl / فِعْلٌ) — MUST come FIRST**
- Position: Beginning of the sentence (this defines it as verbal)
- Case: Verbs don't take case (they have mood: indicative, subjunctive, jussive, imperative)
- Tense: Past (māḍī), present (muḍāriʿ), or command (amr)
- Embedded subject: Often contains hidden pronoun indicating the doer

**2. Subject/Doer (Fāʿil / فَاعِلٌ) — comes AFTER the verb**
- Position: Immediately after verb (standard word order)
- Case: **Always nominative** (rafʿ) — marked by damma, dammatain, or plural markers
- Can be: Explicit noun OR hidden pronoun (embedded in verb conjugation)
- Agreement: Verb agrees with subject in person, number, and gender

**3. Object (Mafʿūl Bihi / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ) — comes AFTER subject (if verb is transitive)**
- Position: Typically follows subject (but can vary for emphasis)
- Case: **Always accusative** (naṣb) — marked by fatha, fathatain, or accusative plural markers
- Only present if verb is transitive (can take an object)

### Word Order: VSO

**Standard pattern:** Verb → Subject → Object

**Examples:**
- خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْإِنسَانَ (khalaqa llāhu l-insāna) — "Allah created mankind"
  - **V:** خَلَقَ "created"
  - **S:** ٱللَّهُ "Allah"
  - **O:** ٱلْإِنسَانَ "mankind"

- أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ (aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar) — "We gave you al-Kawthar"
  - **V:** أَعْطَى "gave" + **S (embedded):** نَا "we"
  - **O₁:** كَ "you"
  - **O₂:** ٱلْكَوْثَرَ "al-Kawthar"

### Distinguishing from Nominal Sentences

**Key test:** What is the FIRST WORD?
- **Begins with VERB** → Verbal sentence (describes action)
- **Begins with NOUN** → Nominal sentence (describes state)

**Examples:**
- ✅ **Verbal:** **خَلَقَ** ٱللَّهُ "Allah created" (verb first)
- ✅ **Nominal:** **ٱللَّهُ** خَالِقٌ "Allah is Creator" (noun first)

- [L2.05: Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case) — Why mafʿūl bihi takes naṣb

- [L3.04: Present Tense Conjugation](/learn/level-3/04-present-tense) — Present tense verb forms

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't assume every sentence with a verb is a verbal sentence.** The sentence must BEGIN with the verb:
- ❌ ٱللَّهُ خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَانَ — This is NOMINAL (starts with noun ٱللَّهُ; verb is part of predicate)
- ✅ خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْإِنسَانَ — This is VERBAL (starts with verb خَلَقَ)

**Don't confuse subject types.** Both nominal and verbal sentences have subjects in nominative case, but they function differently:
- **Mubtadaʾ** (مُبْتَدَأ): Subject of nominal sentence (comes FIRST, describes state)
- **Fāʿil** (فَاعِلٌ): Subject of verbal sentence (comes AFTER verb, does action)

**Don't forget embedded subjects.** Many verbal sentences have NO visible subject because it's hidden in the verb:
- كَتَبَ "He wrote" — subject "he" is embedded, not stated
- كَتَبُوا۟ "They wrote" — subject "they" is embedded in the وْا ending

**Don't mix up VSO word order.** Arabic standard order is different from English:
- ❌ English pattern (SVO): Allah created the heavens
- ✅ Arabic pattern (VSO): Created Allah the heavens — خَلَقَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلسَّمَاوَاتِ

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify whether this is a nominal or verbal sentence and explain why: نَصَرَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ (naṣara llāhu l-muʾminīna) — 'Allah helped the believers'">

**Answer:**

This is a **VERBAL SENTENCE** (جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة jumlah fiʿliyyah).

**Reason:** The sentence begins with a VERB (نَصَرَ "helped"), not a noun.

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **نَصَرَ** (naṣara) — Verb
  - Function: Past tense verb (Form I)
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case
  - Root: ن-ص-ر (nun-ṣad-ra) "to help, aid, support"
  - Tense: Past (māḍī)

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — Subject (فَاعِلٌ fāʿil)
  - Function: Doer of the action
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject of verbal sentence always takes nominative case

- **ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ** (al-muʾminīna) — Object (مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ mafʿūl bihi)
  - Function: Receiver of the action (those who were helped)
  - Case marker: Accusative with kasra + ـِينَ (sound masculine plural accusative ending)
  - Reason: Direct object takes accusative case

**VSO structure:**
- **V:** نَصَرَ "helped"
- **S:** ٱللَّهُ "Allah"
- **O:** ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ "the believers"

**Contrast with nominal:** If this were nominal, it would be: ٱللَّهُ نَاصِرُ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ "Allah is the helper of the believers" (noun first, describes ongoing attribute rather than completed action).

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Explain the difference between these two sentences: (1) ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ and (2) يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ — both translating roughly as 'Allah knows'. Which is nominal and which is verbal?">

**Answer:**

**Sentence 1: ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ**
- Type: **NOMINAL SENTENCE** (جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة)
- Structure:
  - **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱللَّهُ "Allah" (nominative)
  - **Predicate (khabar):** يَعْلَمُ "He knows" (entire verbal sentence serving as predicate)
- Meaning emphasis: Focuses on ALLAH as the topic — describing His attribute of knowledge
- Translation: "Allah — He knows" or "As for Allah, He knows"
- Use case: Describing a permanent, ongoing attribute or state

**Sentence 2: يَعْلَمُ ٱللَّهُ**
- Type: **VERBAL SENTENCE** (جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة)
- Structure:
  - **Verb:** يَعْلَمُ "knows" (present tense)
  - **Subject (fāʿil):** ٱللَّهُ "Allah" (nominative) — can also be hidden: يَعْلَمُ "(He) knows"
  - **Object:** (not present in this example, but could follow)
- Meaning emphasis: Focuses on the ACTION of knowing
- Translation: "Allah knows" (direct statement of action)
- Use case: Narrating an event or specific act of knowing

**Key difference:**
- **Nominal (1):** TOPIC-focused — "Speaking of Allah, He knows" (permanent description)
- **Verbal (2):** ACTION-focused — "Knows + Allah" (event or specific act)

**Practical distinction:** Nominal sentences convey timeless truths or essential attributes. Verbal sentences convey events, actions, and narrative progression.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Identify the verb, subject (fāʿil), and object in this verbal sentence and perform complete i'rab: أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْقُرْآنَ (anzala llāhu l-qurʾāna) — 'Allah revealed the Quran'">

**Answer:**

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

**Components:**
- **Verb:** أَنزَلَ (anzala) "revealed"
- **Subject (فَاعِلٌ fāʿil):** ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) "Allah"
- **Object (مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ mafʿūl bihi):** ٱلْقُرْآنَ (al-qurʾāna) "the Quran"

**Detailed i'rab:**

- **أَنزَلَ** (anzala) — Verb
  - Function: Past tense verb (Form IV)
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case
  - Root: ن-ز-ل (nun-zal-lam) "to descend"
  - Form: Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern) — causative meaning "caused to descend, sent down, revealed"
  - Tense: Past (māḍī)
  - Subject: Hidden pronoun هُوَ "he" (third person masculine singular) — refers to Allah

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — Subject (فَاعِلٌ fāʿil)
  - Function: Explicit subject/doer of the action
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject of verbal sentence takes nominative case (rafʿ)
  - This explicit noun replaces/specifies the hidden pronoun in the verb

- **ٱلْقُرْآنَ** (al-qurʾāna) — Direct object (مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ mafʿūl bihi)
  - Function: What was revealed (receiver of action)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: Direct object of transitive verb takes accusative case (naṣb)

**VSO analysis:**
- **V:** أَنزَلَ "revealed" (Form IV: caused to descend)
- **S:** ٱللَّهُ "Allah" (who performed the revelation)
- **O:** ٱلْقُرْآنَ "the Quran" (what was revealed)

**Morphological insight:** Form IV verb أَنزَلَ (anzala) comes from Form I نَزَلَ (nazala) "descended." The prefix أَ adds causative meaning: "made (it) descend" = "revealed, sent down."

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Create a verbal sentence using VSO word order with the following components: verb كَتَبَ (kataba) 'wrote', subject ٱلطَّالِبُ (aṭ-ṭālibu) 'the student', object ٱلدَّرْسَ (ad-darsa) 'the lesson'. Then identify all three components and their cases.">

**Answer:**

**Verbal sentence:** كَتَبَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلدَّرْسَ (kataba ṭ-ṭālibu d-darsa) — "The student wrote the lesson"

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **كَتَبَ** (kataba) — Verb
  - Function: Past tense verb (Form I)

**VSO structure verification:**
1. **V (Verb):** كَتَبَ "wrote" — ✓ Comes FIRST
2. **S (Subject):** ٱلطَّالِبُ "the student" — ✓ Comes AFTER verb, nominative case
3. **O (Object):** ٱلدَّرْسَ "the lesson" — ✓ Comes AFTER subject, accusative case

**Meaning:** "The student wrote the lesson" — a completed action in the past, with emphasis on the ACT of writing (verbal sentence characteristic).

**Alternative constructions:**
- Nominal: ٱلطَّالِبُ كَتَبَ ٱلدَّرْسَ "The student — he wrote the lesson" (topic: the student)
- With embedded subject only: كَتَبَ ٱلدَّرْسَ "(He) wrote the lesson" (subject hidden)
