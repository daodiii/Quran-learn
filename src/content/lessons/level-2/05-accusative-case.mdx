## Introduction

In [L2.04](/learn/level-2/04-nominative-case/), you mastered when nouns take nominative case — the "doer" and "topic" case for subjects and predicates. Now we turn to the second of Arabic's three cases: the accusative case. This is the "receiver" case, marking nouns that receive actions or describe circumstances.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ"
  transliteration="qul aʿūdhu bi-rabbi l-falaqi"
  translation="Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak'"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "say" },
    { ar: "أَعُوذُ", tr: "aʿūdhu", en: "I seek refuge" },
    { ar: "بِرَبِّ", tr: "bi-rabbi", en: "in the Lord" },
    { ar: "ٱلْفَلَقِ", tr: "l-falaqi", en: "of daybreak" }
  ]}
/>

Notice that this verse contains an imperative verb قُلْ (qul) "say." While verbs don't take case themselves, the words around them DO — and the accusative case plays a crucial role in marking direct objects and other functions. In this lesson, you'll master when and why Arabic nouns shift to accusative case.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand when and why nouns take the [accusative case](/resources/glossary/#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْبٌ)
- Recognize accusative markers across different noun forms: singular, dual, and plural
- Identify direct objects, circumstantial expressions, and other accusative functions
- Apply the i'rab analysis format to accusative constructions

**Connection to previous learning:** You now know nominative marks subjects (fāʿil) and topics (mubtadaʾ). Accusative marks the OPPOSITE role: objects that RECEIVE action rather than perform it. Together, these two cases handle the core relationships in Arabic sentences.

**Key progression:** Nominative (L2.04) → Accusative (L2.05) → Genitive (L2.06). Master all three cases, and you'll unlock the grammatical structure of every Quranic verse.

## Understanding the Accusative Case

**Plain English first:** The accusative case is the "receiver" case. It marks nouns that are receiving an action (direct objects), describing circumstances (time, place, manner), or being affected by special particles. Think of accusative as the "what happened to it?" case — it answers questions like "What did you do?" or "When did it happen?"

**English analogy:** English has accusative case remnants in pronouns. We say "I saw HIM" (not "I saw HE") and "She helped ME" (not "She helped I"). The words "him" and "me" are accusative forms — they receive the action. Arabic extends this principle to ALL nouns using vowel markers.

In the sentence "I read the book," the book is receiving the action of reading. In Arabic, "the book" would take accusative case to show this receiver role.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** The [accusative case](/resources/glossary/#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْبٌ) — literally meaning "setting up" or "positioning" — is marked by specific endings that vary based on the noun's form.

### Accusative Markers by Noun Type

<GrammarTable>
| Noun Type | Accusative Marker | Example | Transliteration | Meaning |
|-----------|-------------------|---------|-----------------|---------|
| **Singular (definite)** | fatha (ـَ) | ٱلرَّجُلَ | ar-rajula | the man (obj.) |
| **Singular (indefinite)** | fathatain (ـً) | رَجُلًا | rajulan | a man (obj.) |
| **Dual** | yaa + nun (ـَيْنِ) | رَجُلَيْنِ | rajulayni | two men (obj.) |
| **Sound Masculine Plural** | yaa + nun (ـِينَ) | مُسْلِمِينَ | muslimīna | Muslims (male, obj.) |
| **Sound Feminine Plural** | kasra (ـِ) | مُسْلِمَاتِ | muslimāti | Muslims (female, obj.) |
| **Broken Plural** | fatha/fathatain | رِجَالًا۟ | rijālan | men (obj.) |
</GrammarTable>

**Key insight:** Compare these to nominative markers (damma ـُ / ـٌ). Nominative uses the "u" sound (damma), while accusative uses the "a" sound (fatha). This vowel shift signals the grammatical function change from doer to receiver.

**Important contrast:**
- Nominative: ٱلرَّجُلُ (ar-rajulu) — the man [as subject]
- Accusative: ٱلرَّجُلَ (ar-rajula) — the man [as object]

The ONLY difference is the final vowel, but it completely changes the grammatical role.

## The Main Functions That Take Accusative Case

There are several grammatical functions that trigger accusative case. We'll focus on the FOUR most common ones you'll encounter in the Quran.

### Function 1: Direct Object (Maf'ul Bih)

The [direct object](/resources/glossary/#maful-bih) (mafʿūl bih / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ) is the noun receiving the action of a verb. It ALWAYS takes accusative case.

**Pattern:** Verb + Subject (nominative) + Object (accusative)

**Example structure:**
- قَرَأَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْكِتَابَ (qaraʾa ṭ-ṭālibu l-kitāba) — "The student read the book"
  - قَرَأَ (qaraʾa): verb "read"
  - ٱلطَّالِبُ (aṭ-ṭālibu): subject (fāʿil) in nominative with damma
  - ٱلْكِتَابَ (al-kitāba): direct object in accusative with fatha

**The principle:** The subject DOES the action (nominative). The object RECEIVES the action (accusative). This is the fundamental subject-object relationship in Arabic grammar.

### Function 2: Circumstantial Expressions (Haal)

The [circumstantial accusative](/resources/glossary/#hal) (ḥāl / حَالٌ۬) describes the state, manner, or circumstances of an action. These expressions answer questions like "How?" "When?" or "In what condition?"

**Examples:**
- Time: يَوْمًا (yawman) — "for a day"
- Manner: صَفًّا صَفًّا (ṣaffan ṣaffan) — "row upon row"
- State: وَحِيدًا۟ (waḥīdan) — "alone"

**Pattern:** The ḥāl noun takes accusative (usually fathatain ـً for indefinite) to show it's describing circumstances rather than being the main subject or object.

### Function 3: Subject of Inna (Ism Inna)

The particle إِنَّ (inna) "indeed/verily" is special — it CHANGES the normal nominative case of a subject to accusative.

**Normal nominal sentence:**
- ٱللَّهُ رَحِيمٌ (allāhu raḥīmun) — "Allah is Merciful"
  - ٱللَّهُ (allāhu): subject (mubtadaʾ) in nominative

**With إِنَّ particle:**
- إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ رَحِيمٌ (inna llāha raḥīmun) — "Indeed, Allah is Merciful"
  - ٱللَّهَ (allāha): subject (ism inna) NOW in accusative with fatha

**Why this matters:** إِنَّ and its sisters (you'll study in [L2.10](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/)) are among the few particles powerful enough to override normal case rules. Recognizing when a subject shifts to accusative helps you identify these emphasis particles.

### Function 4: Predicate of Kaana (Khabar Kaana)

The verb كَانَ۟ (kāna) "was/is" also modifies normal case rules, but in the opposite direction from إِنَّ. It changes the PREDICATE from nominative to accusative.

**Normal nominal sentence:**
- ٱلرَّجُلُ كَرِيمٌ (ar-rajulu karīmun) — "The man is generous"
  - كَرِيمٌ۬ (karīmun): predicate in nominative

**With كَانَ۟ verb:**
- كَانَ۟ ٱلرَّجُلُ كَرِيمًا۟ (kāna r-rajulu karīman) — "The man was generous"
  - ٱلرَّجُلُ (ar-rajulu): subject (ism kāna) stays nominative
  - كَرِيمًا (karīman): predicate (khabar kāna) NOW in accusative

You'll master كَانَ and its sisters in [L2.11](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/). For now, recognize that some verbs and particles have the special power to change expected case patterns.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Surah Al-Falaq (113), which contains clear examples of accusative case in action.

### Example 1: Direct Object After Imperative

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ"
  transliteration="qul aʿūdhu bi-rabbi l-falaqi"
  translation="Say, 'I seek refuge in the Lord of daybreak'"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "say" },
    { ar: "أَعُوذُ", tr: "aʿūdhu", en: "I seek refuge" },
    { ar: "بِرَبِّ", tr: "bi-rabbi", en: "in the Lord" },
    { ar: "ٱلْفَلَقِ", tr: "l-falaqi", en: "of daybreak" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **قُلْ** (qul) — Command verb — "say"
  - Function: Imperative verb meaning "say"
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Reason: Command form addressing the listener
  - Hidden subject: أَنْتَ (you) in nominative

- **أَعُوذُ** (aʿūdhu) — Present tense verb — "I seek refuge"
  - Function: First-person present "I seek refuge"
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Hidden subject: أَنَا۟ (I) in nominative

- **بِرَبِّ** (bi-rabbi) — Prepositional phrase — "in the Lord"
  - **بِ** (bi): Preposition "in/with"
  - **رَبِّ** (rabbi): Genitive with kasra (ـِ) after preposition
  - Function: Object of preposition (note: genitive, not accusative!)
  - This is first part of possessive construction

- **ٱلْفَلَقِ** (al-falaqi) — Possessive — "of daybreak"
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah ("Lord OF daybreak")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Second noun in possessive construction always genitive

**Note on this example:** While this verse doesn't show accusative case directly, it establishes the context for understanding the structure. The preposition بِ triggers genitive case, not accusative — an important distinction you'll master in [L2.06](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/).

### Example 2: Accusative with مِن Construction

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مِن شَرِّ مَا خَلَقَ"
  transliteration="min sharri mā khalaqa"
  translation="From the evil of what He created"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:2"
  highlight="مَا"
  words={[
    { ar: "مِن", tr: "min", en: "from" },
    { ar: "شَرِّ", tr: "sharri", en: "evil" },
    { ar: "مَا", tr: "mā", en: "what" },
    { ar: "خَلَقَ", tr: "khalaqa", en: "He created" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **مِن** (min) — Preposition — "from"
  - Function: Preposition "from"
  - Case: Particles don't take case

- **شَرِّ** (sharri) — Genitive — "evil"
  - Function: Object of preposition مِن
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: After preposition (genitive, not accusative)
  - First part of possessive construction

- **مَا** (mā) — Relative pronoun — "what"
  - Function: Relative pronoun "what/that which"
  - Case: Pronouns don't decline in this context
  - Introduces relative clause

- **خَلَقَ** (khalaqa) — Past tense verb — "He created"
  - Function: Past tense "He created"
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Hidden subject: هُوَ (He) referring to Allah
  - Hidden object: Understood as the relative pronoun مَا

**Advanced insight:** The verb خَلَقَ has a hidden direct object (the relative pronoun مَا functioning as "what He created"). If this object were explicit, it would take accusative case. Understanding hidden accusative objects is part of advanced i'rab analysis.

### Example 3: Multiple Accusative Functions

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ غَاسِقٍ إِذَا وَقَبَ"
  transliteration="wa min sharri ghāsiqin idhā waqaba"
  translation="And from the evil of darkness when it settles"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:3"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَمِن", tr: "wa min", en: "and from" },
    { ar: "شَرِّ", tr: "sharri", en: "evil" },
    { ar: "غَاسِقٍ", tr: "ghāsiqin", en: "darkness" },
    { ar: "إِذَا", tr: "idhā", en: "when" },
    { ar: "وَقَبَ", tr: "waqaba", en: "it settles" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَمِنْ** (wa min) — Conjunction + Preposition — "and from"
  - **وَ** (wa): Conjunction "and"
  - **مِن** (min): Preposition "from"

- **شَرِّ** (sharri) — Genitive — "evil"
  - Function: Object of preposition
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - First part of possessive construction

- **غَاسِقٍ** (ghāsiqin) — Genitive — "darkness"
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah ("evil OF darkness")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasratain (ـٍ)
  - Reason: Second noun in possessive construction

- **إِذَا۟** (idhā) — Conditional particle — "when"
  - Function: Time particle "when"
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Introduces temporal clause

- **وَقَبَ** (waqaba) — Past tense verb — "it settles"
  - Function: Past tense "it settled/descended"
  - Case: Verbs don't take case
  - Hidden subject: هُوَ (it) referring to غَاسِقٍ

**Pedagogical note:** While this verse uses genitive (not accusative) for the main nouns, understanding the i'rab pattern helps you recognize when accusative WOULD apply. If غَاسِقٍ were a direct object instead of a possessive, it would take accusative: غَاسِقًا۟ (ghāsiqan).

### Example 4: Seeking Refuge from Evil (Demonstrating Object Pattern)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ ٱلنَّفَّٰثَٰتِ فِى ٱلْعُقَدِ"
  transliteration="wa min sharri n-naffāthāti fī l-ʿuqadi"
  translation="And from the evil of the blowers in knots"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:4"
  highlight="ٱلنَّفَّٰثَٰتِ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَمِن", tr: "wa min", en: "and from" },
    { ar: "شَرِّ", tr: "sharri", en: "evil" },
    { ar: "ٱلنَّفَّٰثَٰتِ", tr: "n-naffāthāti", en: "the blowers" },
    { ar: "فِى", tr: "fī", en: "in" },
    { ar: "ٱلْعُقَدِ", tr: "l-ʿuqadi", en: "the knots" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَمِنْ** (wa min) — Conjunction + Preposition — "and from"
  - Same structure as previous verse

- **شَرِّ** (sharri) — Genitive — "evil"
  - Function: Object of preposition مِن
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - First part of iḍāfah

- **ٱلنَّفَّٰثَٰتِ** (an-naffāthāti) — Genitive — "the blowers"
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah ("evil OF the blowers")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Sound feminine plural in genitive
  - Pattern: ـَاتِ ending shows feminine plural genitive/accusative (same form!)

- **فِى** (fī) — Preposition — "in"
  - Function: Preposition "in/into"

- **ٱلْعُقَدِ** (al-ʿuqadi) — Genitive — "the knots"
  - Function: Object of preposition فِى
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: After preposition

**Important observation:** The sound feminine plural ٱلنَّفَّٰثَٰتِ has the SAME form in both genitive and accusative cases — both use kasra (ـِ). Only in nominative does it differ (ـَاتُ). This is a unique feature of feminine plurals.

### Example 5: Contrast — What If It Were Accusative?

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِن شَرِّ حَاسِدٍ إِذَا حَسَدَ"
  transliteration="wa min sharri ḥāsidin idhā ḥasada"
  translation="And from the evil of an envier when he envies"
  reference="Al-Falaq 113:5"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَمِن", tr: "wa min", en: "and from" },
    { ar: "شَرِّ", tr: "sharri", en: "evil" },
    { ar: "حَاسِدٍ", tr: "ḥāsidin", en: "an envier" },
    { ar: "إِذَا", tr: "idhā", en: "when" },
    { ar: "حَسَدَ", tr: "ḥasada", en: "he envies" }
  ]}
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَمِن شَرِّ** (wa min sharri) — Same pattern as previous verses — "and from [the] evil"
  - Genitive after preposition

- **حَاسِدٍ** (ḥāsidin) — Genitive — "an envier"
  - Function: Second part of iḍāfah ("evil OF envier")
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasratain (ـٍ)
  - Indefinite singular masculine noun

- **إِذَا۟** (idhā) — Conditional particle — "when"
  - Function: Time particle "when"

- **حَسَدَ** (ḥasada) — Past tense verb — "he envies"
  - Function: Past tense "he envied"
  - Hidden subject: هُوَ (he) referring to حَاسِدٍ
  - Hidden object: Would be accusative if explicit

**Teaching moment — accusative contrast:**

If we restructured this as a direct object sentence:
- نَتَّقِي ٱلْحَاسِدَ (nattaqī l-ḥāsida) — "We guard against the envier"
  - ٱلْحَاسِدَ (al-ḥāsida): Direct object in accusative with fatha (ـَ)

Compare:
- **Genitive (current):** حَاسِدٍ (ḥāsidin) with kasratain (ـٍ) — "OF an envier"
- **Accusative (if object):** حَاسِدًا۟ (ḥāsidan) with fathatain (ـً) — "an envier" as object
- **Nominative (if subject):** حَاسِدٌ (ḥāsidun) with dammatain (ـٌ) — "an envier" as subject

This three-way contrast shows how case endings signal grammatical relationships.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="When Nouns Take Accusative Case">

The [accusative case](/resources/glossary/#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْبٌ) applies in these PRIMARY situations:

1. **Direct object (mafʿūl bih / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ)**
   - The noun receiving the action of a verb
   - Example: قَرَأْتُ **ٱلْكِتَابَ** (qaraʾtu l-**kitāba**) — I read **the book**

2. **Circumstantial expressions (ḥāl / حَالٌ۬)**
   - Describes manner, time, or state
   - Example: جَلَسَ **وَحِيدًا** (jalasa **waḥīdan**) — He sat **alone**

3. **Subject after إِنَّ (ism inna / اِسْمُ إِنَّ)**
   - Special particles that change subject from nominative to accusative
   - Example: إِنَّ **ٱللَّهَ** رَحِيمٌ (inna **llāha** raḥīmun) — Indeed, **Allah** is Merciful

4. **Predicate after كَانَ (khabar kāna / خَبَرُ كَانَ)**
   - Special verbs that change predicate from nominative to accusative
   - Example: كَانَ **رَحِيمًا** (kāna **raḥīman**) — (He) was **merciful**

**Accusative markers:**
- Singular: fatha (ـَ) or fathatain (ـً)
- Dual: yaa + nun (ـَيْنِ)
- Sound masculine plural: yaa + nun (ـِينَ)
- Sound feminine plural: kasra (ـِ) — same as genitive!
- Broken plurals: fatha/fathatain (ـَ / ـً)

**Critical distinction:**
- Nominative (rafʿ): DOER or TOPIC — marked by damma (ـُ)
- Accusative (naṣb): RECEIVER or CIRCUMSTANCE — marked by fatha (ـَ)
- Genitive (jarr): POSSESSION or AFTER PREPOSITION — marked by kasra (ـِ)

**Related lessons:**
- [L2.04: The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/04-nominative-case/) — Subjects and topics
- [L2.06: The Genitive Case](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/) — Possession and prepositions
- [L2.10: Inna and Sisters](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/) — Particles that trigger accusative subjects
- [L2.11: Kaana and Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/) — Verbs that trigger accusative predicates

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't confuse accusative and genitive markers in feminine plurals.** Sound feminine plural nouns have the SAME form (ـَاتِ with kasra) in both accusative and genitive cases. Only the sentence context tells you which case applies. After a preposition = genitive. As a direct object = accusative.

**Don't assume fatha always means accusative.** While fatha is the PRIMARY accusative marker for singular nouns, context matters. Always ask: "Is this noun receiving an action? Describing circumstances? After إِنَّ or كَانَ?" If none apply, it might be a different grammatical function.

**Don't forget the dual and plural accusative forms are different.** Singular uses fatha (ـَ), but dual uses yaa + nun (ـَيْنِ) and sound masculine plural uses yaa + nun (ـِينَ). These are completely different endings that you must memorize.

**Don't confuse objects with subjects.** The word order Verb-Subject-Object is common in Arabic, but the case endings are what truly mark function. Even if word order varies, the accusative marker on a noun tells you it's the object, not the subject.

</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify the accusative noun in this sentence and explain its function: رَأَيْتُ ٱلْقَمَرَ فِى ٱلسَّمَاءِ (raʾaytu l-qamara fī s-samāʾi) — 'I saw the moon in the sky'">

**Answer:**

**Accusative noun:** ٱلْقَمَرَ (al-qamara) — "the moon"

**Analysis:**
- Function: Direct object (mafʿūl bih)
- Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
- Reason: This noun receives the action of the verb رَأَيْتُ (raʾaytu) "I saw"

**Complete iʿrāb:**

- **رَأَيْتُ** (raʾaytu) — Past tense verb
  - Function: Verb "I saw" with first-person pronoun تُ
  - Hidden subject: أَنَا۟ (I) in nominative

- **ٱلْقَمَرَ** (al-qamara) — Direct object
  - Function: Object of verb "the thing I saw"
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - **This is Function 1: Direct Object**

- **فِى** (fī) — Preposition "in"

- **ٱلسَّمَاءِ** (as-samāʾi) — Genitive
  - Function: Object of preposition
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - NOT accusative! After preposition = genitive

**Key lesson:** Only ٱلْقَمَرَ is accusative (direct object). The word ٱلسَّمَاءِ after the preposition فِى is genitive, not accusative.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Convert this nominative subject to accusative by adding إِنَّ: ٱلْإِنْسَانُ فِى خُسْرٍ (al-insānu fī khusrin) — 'Mankind is in loss'. Then perform complete iʿrāb on both versions.">

**Answer:**

**Original (nominative subject):**
ٱلْإِنْسَانُ فِى خُسْرٍ

**With إِنَّ (accusative subject):**
إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ (inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin) — "Indeed, mankind is in loss" [Al-ʿAsr 103:2]

**Complete iʿrāb — ORIGINAL version:**

- **ٱلْإِنسَانُ** (al-insānu) — Subject
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Basic nominal sentence subject

- **فِى خُسْرٍ** (fī khusrin) — Predicate
  - Function: Predicate (khabar) as prepositional phrase
  - فِى (fī): Preposition "in"
  - خُسْرٍ (khusrin): Genitive with kasratain (ـٍ) after preposition

**Complete iʿrāb — WITH إِنَّ:**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Particle
  - Function: Emphasis particle "indeed/verily"
  - Effect: Changes subject from nominative to accusative

- **ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ** (al-insāna) — Subject
  - Function: Subject after إِنَّ (ism inna)
  - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
  - Reason: **Function 3: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative**

- **لَفِى خُسْرٍ** (la-fī khusrin) — Predicate
  - Function: Predicate of إِنَّ (khabar inna)
  - لَ (la): Emphatic particle
  - فِى (fī): Preposition
  - خُسْرٍ (khusrin): Genitive after preposition

**The transformation:**
- Without إِنَّ: ٱلْإِنسَانُ (nominative ـُ)
- With إِنَّ: ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ (accusative ـَ)

**Key lesson:** The particle إِنَّ has the grammatical power to override the normal nominative case for subjects, shifting them to accusative for emphasis.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: In the sentence كَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا (kāna llāhu ghafūran raḥīman) — 'Allah is Forgiving and Merciful', identify ALL accusative nouns and explain why each takes this case.">

**Answer:**

**Accusative nouns:**

1. **غَفُورًا** (ghafūran) — "Forgiving"
   - Function: Predicate after كَانَ (khabar kāna)
   - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
   - Reason: **Function 4: كَانَ puts its predicate in accusative**

2. **رَّحِيمًا** (raḥīman) — "Merciful"
   - Function: Second predicate coordinated with غَفُورًا
   - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
   - Reason: Matches the case of the first predicate (both describe Allah)

**NOT accusative:**

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — "Allah"
  - Function: Subject after كَانَ (ism kāna)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: كَانَ keeps the subject nominative, but changes the predicate to accusative

**Complete iʿrāb:**

- **كَانَ** (kāna) — Past tense "was/is" (timeless verb)
  - Function: Defective verb that modifies nominal sentence case
  - Effect: Subject stays nominative, predicate becomes accusative

- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — Subject
  - Function: Subject of كَانَ (ism kāna)
  - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Subject remains nominative with كَانَ

- **غَفُورًا** (ghafūran) — Predicate
  - Function: First predicate (khabar kāna)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: Function 4 — كَانَ makes predicate accusative

- **رَّحِيمًا** (raḥīman) — Second predicate
  - Function: Coordinated predicate (second attribute)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
  - Reason: Matches case of first predicate

**The pattern:**
- Without كَانَ: ٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ رَّحِيمٌ (both predicates nominative with ـٌ)
- With كَانَ: كَانَ ٱللَّهُ غَفُورًا رَّحِيمًا (both predicates accusative with ـً)

**Key lesson:** كَانَ modifies case rules in the OPPOSITE way from إِنَّ. إِنَّ changes the subject to accusative. كَانَ changes the predicate to accusative. Both are special grammatical tools.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Advanced — Explain why these three nouns have different cases in the same sentence: جَاءَ رَسُولُ ٱللَّهِ يَوْمًا (jāʾa rasūlu llāhi yawman) — 'The Messenger of Allah came one day'. Identify each case and its reason.">

**Answer:**

**Three nouns, three different cases:**

**1. رَسُولُ (rasūlu) — NOMINATIVE**
- Function: Subject of verbal sentence (fāʿil)
- Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
- Reason: Subject of the verb جَاءَ۟ (jāʾa) "came"
- This is the DOER of the action

**2. ٱللَّهِ (allāhi) — GENITIVE**
- Function: Second part of possessive construction (muḍāf ilayh)
- Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
- Reason: Second noun in iḍāfah "Messenger OF Allah"
- Possessive relationship always requires genitive

**3. يَوْمًا (yawman) — ACCUSATIVE**
- Function: Circumstantial time expression (ẓarf zamān)
- Case marker: Accusative with fathatain (ـً)
- Reason: **Function 2: Circumstantial expression** answering "when?"
- Not the subject or object, but describing the circumstances

**Complete iʿrāb:**

- **جَاءَ۟** (jāʾa) — Past tense verb "came"

- **رَسُولُ** (rasūlu) — Subject
  - Function: Fāʿil (doer of action)
  - Case: **Nominative** (ـُ)
  - First part of iḍāfah

- **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi) — Possessive
  - Function: Muḍāf ilayh (second part of possession)
  - Case: **Genitive** (ـِ)
  - Second part of iḍāfah

- **يَوْمًا** (yawman) — Time expression
  - Function: Ẓarf zamān (temporal adverb)
  - Case: **Accusative** (ـً)
  - Describes when the action occurred

**The principle:** Each noun is governed by DIFFERENT grammatical relationships:
- رَسُولُ: Governed by its role in the sentence (subject → nominative)
- ٱللَّهِ: Governed by its position in the phrase (second in iḍāfah → genitive)
- يَوْمًا: Governed by its descriptive function (circumstance → accusative)

**Visual breakdown:**
```
جَاءَ۟    [verb - no case]
رَسُولُ  [subject → NOM]
ٱللَّهِ  [possession → GEN]
يَوْمًا  [time circumstance → ACC]
```

All three cases (nominative, accusative, genitive) appearing in one short sentence — this is the power and precision of Arabic grammar!
