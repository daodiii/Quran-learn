## Introduction

In [L2.01 The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/), you learned that a nominal sentence consists of two parts in nominative case. Now we'll dive deeper into these components, examining the different types of subjects and predicates, their agreement rules, and how to analyze them with precision.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلْعَصْرِ ۝ إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ"
  transliteration="wa-l-ʿaṣri inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin"
  translation="By time, indeed mankind is in loss"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:1-2"
  highlight="ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ,خُسْرٍ"
/>

The clause "إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ" (inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin) contains a nominal sentence modified by إِنَّ. Understanding the [subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ) and [predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar) (khabar) structure allows you to analyze how إِنَّ affects the case endings and how the predicate takes the form of a prepositional phrase.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Identify the [subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) and [predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar) (khabar / خَبَرٌ) in nominal sentences
- Understand the three types of predicates: single word, sentence, and semi-sentence
- Master agreement rules between subject and predicate
- Analyze complex nominal sentences from Quranic examples using three-part i'rab analysis

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L2.01](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/), you learned the basic structure of nominal sentences. Now we'll examine the nature and types of each component in detail, building the analytical skills needed for [L2.09 Adjective Agreement](/learn/level-2/09-adjective-agreement/), [L2.10 Inna Sisters](/learn/level-2/10-inna-sisters/), and [L2.11 Kaana Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/).

## Understanding Subject and Predicate

**Plain English first:** Think of the subject (mubtadaʾ) as the "announcement" — what you're going to talk about. The predicate (khabar) is the "news" — what you're saying about that topic. It's like a two-part news headline: "SUBJECT: INFORMATION."

**English analogy:** In English, we might say "The President — elected yesterday" or "That book — fascinating!" The dash represents the invisible connection that Arabic creates through grammatical case. The first part establishes the topic; the second provides information.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** The [subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — literally "the begun with" — is the topic of discussion. The [predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar) (khabar / خَبَرٌ) — literally "the news" — is what you're saying about that topic.

### The Subject (Mubtadaʾ) in Detail

The subject has specific characteristics:

**1. Usually definite:** The mubtadaʾ is typically definite because you need to identify WHAT you're talking about before providing information.
- Definite with ال: ٱلْكِتَابُ (al-kitābu) "the book"
- Proper noun: مُحَمَّدٌ (muḥammadun) "Muhammad"
- Attached pronoun: كِتَابُهُۥ (kitābuhu) "his book"
- Independent pronoun: هُوَ (huwa) "he"

**2. Takes nominative case:** Always marked by damma (ـُ), dammatain (ـٌ), waw (ـُو for dual/plural), or alif (ـُونَ for sound masculine plural).

**3. Usually comes first:** The default position is at the beginning of the sentence, though it can be postponed for emphasis (which we'll explore later).

**4. Can be a pronoun:** Unlike English, Arabic commonly uses independent pronouns as subjects in nominal sentences.

### The Predicate (Khabar) in Detail

The predicate provides the information about the subject. It has three main types:

<GrammarTable>
| Type | Arabic Term | Description | Example | Translation |
|------|-------------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **Single word** | مُفْرَد (mufrad) | One word: noun or adjective | ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ | "Allah is One" |
| **Sentence** | جُمْلَة (jumlah) | Complete nominal or verbal sentence | ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ | "Allah knows" |
| **Semi-sentence** | شِبْهُ جُمْلَة (shibhu jumlah) | Prepositional or adverbial phrase | ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ | "Praise is for Allah" |
</GrammarTable>

**Type 1: Single Word Predicate (Mufrad)**

The simplest form — a single noun or adjective describing the subject:
- **ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ** (allāhu ʿalīmun) — "Allah is All-Knowing"
- **ٱلْقُرْآنُ هُدًى** (al-qurʾānu hudan) — "The Quran is guidance"

**Type 2: Sentence Predicate (Jumlah)**

A complete sentence serving as the predicate:
- **ٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ** (allāhu yaʿlamu l-ghayba) — "Allah knows the unseen"
  - Subject: ٱللَّهُ
  - Predicate: يَعْلَمُ ٱلْغَيْبَ (entire verbal sentence)

**Type 3: Semi-Sentence Predicate (Shibh Jumlah)**

A prepositional phrase or adverb of place/time:
- **ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ** (al-ḥamdu lillāhi) — "Praise is for Allah"
  - Subject: ٱلْحَمْدُ
  - Predicate: لِلَّهِ (prepositional phrase)

### Agreement Rules

**The fundamental principle:** The predicate must agree with the subject in NUMBER, GENDER, and DEFINITENESS (for single-word predicates only).

**Number agreement:**
- Singular subject → singular predicate: ٱلْمُؤْمِنُ صَادِقٌ (al-muʾminu ṣādiqun) "The believer is truthful"
- Dual subject → dual predicate: ٱلْمُؤْمِنَانِ صَادِقَانِ (al-muʾmināni ṣādiqāni) "The two believers are truthful"
- Plural subject → plural predicate: ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ صَادِقُونَ (al-muʾminūna ṣādiqūna) "The believers are truthful"

**Gender agreement:**
- Masculine subject → masculine predicate: ٱلرَّجُلُ كَرِيمٌ (ar-rajulu karīmun) "The man is generous"
- Feminine subject → feminine predicate: ٱلْمَرْأَةُ كَرِيمَةٌ (al-marʾatu karīmatun) "The woman is generous"

**Definiteness patterns:**
- Definite subject + definite predicate = identification: ٱلْعِلْمُ ٱلنُّورُ "Knowledge is THE light" (specific identification)
- Definite subject + indefinite predicate = description: ٱلْعِلْمُ نُورٌ "Knowledge is A light" (category/quality)

## Examples from the Quran

Let's analyze examples from Surah Al-Asr (103), examining different predicate types and their grammatical structure.

### Example 1: Semi-Sentence Predicate (Prepositional Phrase)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِي خُسْرٍ"
  transliteration="inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin"
  translation="Indeed, mankind is in loss"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:2"
  highlight="ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ,فِى خُسْرٍ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle
  - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Introduces emphasized nominal sentence

- **ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ** (al-insāna) — Name of inna (subject)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (ism inna)
  - Case marker: Accusative with fatha (ـَ)
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative case

- **لَ** (la) — Emphasis particle
  - Function: Additional emphasis particle
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Reinforces the assertion

- **فِى خُسْرٍ** (fī khusrin) — Predicate (khabar inna)
  - Function: Predicate of inna (semi-sentence type)
  - Case marker: Nominative (prepositional phrase)
  - Reason: Predicate of إِنَّ remains nominative; فِى is preposition, خُسْرٍ is genitive with kasra + tanwin

**Structural insight:** The predicate here is a prepositional phrase (semi-sentence), not a single word. The preposition فِى (fī) "in" combined with the noun خُسْرٍ (khusrin) "loss" creates the meaning "in loss." This is a common predicate pattern in Arabic.

### Example 2: Modified Nominal Sentence with Exception

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ"
  transliteration="illā lladhīna āmanū wa ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāti"
  translation="Except for those who have believed and done righteous deeds"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:3"
  highlight="ٱلَّذِينَ,ءَامَنُوا۟,عَمِلُوا۟"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِلَّا** (illā) — Exception particle
  - Function: Exception particle
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Introduces the excepted group

- **ٱلَّذِينَ** (alladhīna) — Excepted noun (mustathnan)
  - Function: Excepted from the general statement of loss
  - Case marker: Accusative (indeclinable relative pronoun)
  - Reason: Excepted term after إِلَّا takes accusative

- **ءَامَنُوا۟** (āmanū) — Past tense verb
  - Function: Verb in relative clause describing ٱلَّذِينَ
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case (past tense, plural)
  - Reason: Past tense verb with و plural subject marker

- **وَعَمِلُوا۟** (wa ʿamilū) — Coordinated verb
  - Function: Second verb coordinated with ءَامَنُوا۟
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case (past tense, plural)
  - Reason: Coordinating و connects two verbs

- **ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ** (aṣ-ṣāliḥāti) — Direct object
  - Function: Object of عَمِلُوا۟ (mafʿūl bihi)
  - Case marker: Accusative with kasra (ـِ) — sound feminine plural
  - Reason: Direct object takes accusative; sound feminine plural shows accusative with kasra

**Advanced note:** This verse contains a relative clause (صِلَةٌٌ ṣilah) modifying ٱلَّذِينَ. The entire phrase "those who believed and did righteous deeds" functions as the excepted group from the general statement in verse 2.

### Example 3: Compound Nominal Structure

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلْحَقِّ وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ"
  transliteration="wa tawāṣaw bi-l-ḥaqqi wa tawāṣaw bi-ṣ-ṣabri"
  translation="And advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:3"
  highlight="بِٱلْحَقِّ,بِٱلصَّبْرِ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَ** (wa) — Coordinating conjunction
  - Function: Connects this clause to previous
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Coordination particle

- **تَوَاصَوْا۟** (tawāṣaw) — Past tense verb (Form VI)
  - Function: Verb describing the excepted believers
  - Case marker: Verbs don't take case (past, plural)
  - Reason: Form VI (mutual action): they counseled one another

- **بِٱلْحَقِّ** (bi-l-ḥaqqi) — Prepositional phrase
  - Function: Specifies what they counseled about
  - Case marker: بِ is preposition; ٱلْحَقِّ is genitive with kasra (ـِ) + shadda
  - Reason: Prepositions trigger genitive case

- **وَتَوَاصَوْا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ** (wa tawāṣaw bi-ṣ-ṣabri) — Parallel structure
  - Function: Second coordinated verbal sentence
  - Case marker: Same analysis as first تَوَاصَوْا۟ clause
  - Reason: Parallel construction emphasizing two types of mutual counsel

**Word-by-word morphological breakdown of تَوَاصَوْا۟:**

**تَوَاصَوْا۟** (tawāṣaw):
- Root: و-ص-ى (waw-ṣad-ya), meaning "to counsel, advise"
- Form: Form VI (تَفَاعَلَ tafāʿala pattern) indicating mutual/reciprocal action
- Tense: Past tense (māḍī)
- Subject: و plural pronoun (they) — hidden within verb conjugation
- Meaning: "They mutually advised one another"

**Structural insight:** The repetition of تَوَاصَوْا۟ with different prepositional phrases creates emphasis through parallelism. This rhetorical pattern is common in Quranic discourse.

### Example 4: Complete Analysis of Full Verse

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلْعَصْرِ"
  transliteration="wa-l-ʿaṣri"
  translation="By time"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:1"
  highlight="ٱلْعَصْرِ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَ** (wa) — Oath particle
  - Function: Introduces Divine oath
  - Case marker: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Oath formula (qasam)

- **ٱلْعَصْرِ** (al-ʿaṣri) — Noun in oath formula
  - Function: Object of oath (muqsam bihi)
  - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Oath و triggers genitive case (like a preposition)

**Word-by-word morphological breakdown:**

**ٱلْعَصْرِ** (al-ʿaṣri):
- Root: ع-ص-ر (ʿayn-ṣad-ra), meaning "to press, squeeze; time, era"
- Form: Noun pattern فَعْلٌ
- Definiteness: Definite with ال article
- Case: Genitive (after oath و)
- Meaning: "The time" or "The era" (scholars differ on specific meaning: afternoon prayer time, all of time, or the era of the Prophet)

**Theological precision through grammar:** The oath formula highlights the gravity of what follows. Allah swears by time itself before making the profound statement about mankind's state.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Subject and Predicate Structure">

A [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah) consists of two essential components:

### 1. Subject (Mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ)

**Characteristics:**
- Usually definite (with ال, proper noun, or pronoun)
- Takes nominative case (rafʿ) with damma (ـُ), dammatain (ـٌ), or appropriate plural markers
- Typically comes first (but can be postponed for emphasis)
- Establishes the topic of discussion

**Examples:**
- ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) "Allah"
- ٱلْكِتَابُ (al-kitābu) "the book"
- هُوَ (huwa) "he"

### 2. Predicate (Khabar / خَبَرٌ)

**Types:**
1. **Single word (مُفْرَد mufrad):** noun or adjective
2. **Sentence (جُمْلَة jumlah):** complete nominal or verbal sentence
3. **Semi-sentence (شِبْهُ جُمْلَة shibh jumlah):** prepositional or adverbial phrase

**Agreement rules:**
- Must agree with subject in NUMBER (singular, dual, plural)
- Must agree with subject in GENDER (masculine, feminine)
- Definiteness pattern determines meaning:
  - Definite + definite = identification/equation
  - Definite + indefinite = description/categorization

**Case marking:**
- Basic nominal sentence: predicate takes nominative (rafʿ)
- With إِنَّ: predicate remains nominative (khabar inna)
- With كَانَ: predicate becomes accusative (khabar kāna)

- [L2.11: Kaana and Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/) — How كَانَ affects predicate case

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't confuse predicate types.** When analyzing khabar, identify which of the three types it is:
- If it's one word describing the subject → single word (mufrad)
- If it's a complete sentence about the subject → sentence (jumlah)
- If it's a prepositional phrase or adverb → semi-sentence (shibh jumlah)

**Don't ignore agreement rules.** The predicate MUST match the subject:
- ❌ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ صَادِقٌ (plural subject + singular predicate) — WRONG
- ✅ ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ صَادِقُونَ (plural + plural) — CORRECT

**Don't assume all predicates are single words.** Many Quranic predicates are prepositional phrases (like لِلَّهِ, فِى خُسْرٍ) or entire sentences. Recognizing predicate type is essential for correct grammatical analysis.

**Don't confuse definiteness patterns.** The definiteness of the predicate changes meaning:
- ٱلْعِلْمُ نُورٌ "Knowledge is A light" (indefinite predicate = describing quality)
- ٱلْعِلْمُ ٱلنُّورُ "Knowledge is THE light" (definite predicate = complete identification)

</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify the mubtadaʾ and khabar in this verse, and classify the khabar type: ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ (allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu) — 'Allah is the Eternal Refuge' [Al-Ikhlas 112:2]">

**Answer:**

**Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) — "Allah"
- Function: Subject of nominal sentence
- Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
- Reason: Subject always takes nominative case

**Predicate (khabar):** ٱلصَّمَدُ (aṣ-ṣamadu) — "the Eternal Refuge"
- Function: Predicate of nominal sentence
- Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
- Reason: Predicate takes nominative in basic nominal sentence
- **Type: Single word (مُفْرَد mufrad)** — one adjective/noun describing the subject

**Definiteness pattern:** Both subject and predicate are definite (with ال or divine name). This creates an IDENTIFICATION meaning: "Allah IS the Eternal Refuge" (not merely "a refuge," but THE definitive embodiment of this attribute).

**Agreement check:**
- Number: Singular subject → singular predicate ✓
- Gender: Masculine subject → masculine predicate ✓
- Definiteness: Definite subject → definite predicate ✓

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Analyze the following nominal sentence and identify the predicate type: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīna) — 'All praise is for Allah, Lord of the worlds' [Al-Fatiha 1:2]">

**Answer:**

**Complete grammatical analysis:**

**Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱلْحَمْدُ (al-ḥamdu) — "the praise"
- Function: Subject of nominal sentence
- Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
- Reason: Subject takes nominative

**Predicate (khabar):** لِلَّهِ (lillāhi) — "for Allah"
- Function: Predicate of nominal sentence
- Case marker: لِ is preposition; ٱللَّهِ is genitive with kasra (ـِ)
- Reason: Prepositional phrase serving as predicate
- **Type: Semi-sentence (شِبْهُ جُمْلَة shibh jumlah)** — prepositional phrase

**Additional description:** رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (rabbi l-ʿālamīna) — "Lord of the worlds"
- Function: Appositive/attribute describing ٱللَّهِ
- Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ) matching ٱللَّهِ
- Reason: Descriptive term follows and matches the case of the word it describes

**Structural insight:** The predicate is NOT a single word but an entire prepositional phrase. The semi-sentence predicate (لِلَّهِ "for Allah") conveys that praise BELONGS TO Allah, not merely that Allah IS praise. This prepositional structure is very common in Quranic nominal sentences.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Explain the agreement between mubtadaʾ and khabar in this verse: ٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ (alladhīna yuʾminūna bi-l-ghaybi) — 'Those who believe in the unseen' [Al-Baqarah 2:3]. What type of predicate is يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ?">

**Answer:**

**Grammatical analysis:**

**Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱلَّذِينَ (alladhīna) — "those who"
- Function: Relative pronoun serving as subject
- Case marker: Indeclinable (always appears the same)
- Reason: Relative pronouns don't change form for case
- Number: Plural masculine
- Definiteness: Definite (relative pronouns are inherently definite)

**Predicate (khabar):** يُؤْمِنُونَ بِٱلْغَيْبِ (yuʾminūna bi-l-ghaybi) — "they believe in the unseen"
- Function: Predicate (entire verbal sentence)
- **Type: Sentence (جُمْلَة jumlah)** — a complete verbal sentence serving as predicate
- Structure: Present tense verb + prepositional phrase

**Agreement analysis:**

The verbal sentence predicate contains:
- **يُؤْمِنُونَ** (yuʾminūna) — present tense verb with نَ ending indicating plural masculine subject
- **بِٱلْغَيْبِ** (bi-l-ghaybi) — prepositional phrase (object of belief)

**How agreement works:**
- The hidden subject pronoun in يُؤْمِنُونَ (they) matches the number and gender of ٱلَّذِينَ
- Plural masculine subject ٱلَّذِينَ → plural masculine verb يُؤْمِنُونَ ✓
- This creates the connection: "Those who (they) believe..."

**Advanced insight:** When the predicate is a sentence (jumlah), it must contain a pronoun (visible or hidden) that refers back to the subject. This pronoun creates the grammatical link (رَابِطٌٌ rābiṭ) between subject and sentential predicate.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Create a nominal sentence using a semi-sentence predicate (prepositional phrase) with the subject ٱلْعِلْمُ (al-ʿilmu) 'knowledge'. Then perform complete i'rab analysis.">

**Answer:**

**Nominal sentence:** ٱلْعِلْمُ فِى ٱلْقُرْآنِ (al-ʿilmu fī l-qurʾāni) — "Knowledge is in the Quran"

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

**Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱلْعِلْمُ (al-ʿilmu) — "the knowledge"
- Function: Subject of nominal sentence
- Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
- Reason: Subject takes nominative case
- Definiteness: Definite with ال article
- Form: Singular masculine noun

**Predicate (khabar):** فِى ٱلْقُرْآنِ (fī l-qurʾāni) — "in the Quran"
- Function: Predicate of nominal sentence (semi-sentence type)
- **Type: Semi-sentence (شِبْهُ جُمْلَة shibh jumlah)** — prepositional phrase
- Structure breakdown:
  - **فِى** (fī) — Preposition meaning "in"
  - **ٱلْقُرْآنِ** (al-qurʾāni) — Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
  - Reason: Prepositions trigger genitive case on following noun

**Meaning insight:** The prepositional phrase predicate emphasizes LOCATION or SOURCE. "Knowledge is IN the Quran" conveys that knowledge is contained within, sourced from, or found in the Quran — a richer meaning than simply saying "The Quran is knowledge" (which would use a single-word predicate).

**Alternative constructions:**
- Single word: ٱلْعِلْمُ نَافِعٌ (al-ʿilmu nāfiʿun) "Knowledge is beneficial"
- Sentence: ٱلْعِلْمُ يَنْفَعُ (al-ʿilmu yanfaʿu) "Knowledge benefits"

Each predicate type creates different nuances of meaning!
