## Introduction

In [L2.01 The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/) and [L2.02 Subject and Predicate](/learn/level-2/02-subject-predicate/), you learned that both the subject (mubtadaʾ) and predicate (khabar) take nominative case in basic nominal sentences. Now we'll explore a group of particles that CHANGE this pattern by putting the subject into accusative case.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ"
  transliteration="inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin"
  translation="Indeed, mankind is in loss"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:2"
  highlight="إِنَّ,ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ"
/>

Notice that ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ (al-insāna) ends with fatha (ـَ), the accusative marker, not damma. Why? Because the particle إِنَّ (inna) "indeed" has entered the nominal sentence and modified the subject's case. This is one of Arabic grammar's most important patterns.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand how [inna and her sisters](/resources/glossary/#inna-sisters) (إِنَّ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا) modify nominal sentences
- Recognize all six particles in the inna family and their meanings
- Identify when the subject changes from nominative to accusative case
- Analyze inna sentences from Quranic verses using three-part iʿrāb analysis

**Connection to previous learning:** You've mastered nominal sentences where both parts are nominative ([L2.01](/learn/level-2/01-nominal-sentence/)). You've also learned about the [accusative case](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case/) for objects. Now you'll see how inna particles create a special situation: accusative subjects. This prepares you for [L2.11 Kaana Sisters](/learn/level-2/11-kaana-sisters/), which modify the OTHER part of the sentence.

**Key Level 2 skill:** Understanding inna and her sisters demonstrates Arabic's systematic precision — case changes aren't random, they follow specific rules based on which particles or verbs enter the sentence.

## Understanding Inna and Her Sisters

**Plain English first:** Think of إِنَّ (inna) like adding EMPHASIS in English. When we say "Indeed, mankind is in loss" or "Truly, Allah is forgiving," those words "indeed" and "truly" add emphasis to the statement. Arabic does the same thing, but when these emphasis particles enter the sentence, they trigger a grammatical change — the subject switches from nominative to accusative.

**English analogy:** Imagine if in English, adding "indeed" changed "he" to "him": "Indeed him is truthful." That's what happens in Arabic — the emphasis particle changes the case marker on the subject. It's a visible grammatical signal that emphasis has been added.

**Now the Arabic terminology:** The family of particles called [inna and her sisters](/resources/glossary/#inna-sisters) (إِنَّ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا inna wa akhawātuhā) consists of six particles that share the same grammatical effect. When any of these particles enters a nominal sentence, two things happen:

1. The subject ([name of inna](/resources/glossary/#ism-inna) / اِسْمُ إِنَّ / ism inna) becomes **accusative** (marked with fatha ـَ)
2. The predicate ([predicate of inna](/resources/glossary/#khabar-inna) / خَبَرُ إِنَّ / khabar inna) remains **nominative** (marked with damma ـُ)

### The Six Sisters

<GrammarTable>
| Particle | Transliteration | Meaning | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|---------|
| **إِنَّ** | inna | indeed, verily | إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ — "Indeed, Allah is Forgiving" |
| **أَنَّ** | anna | that (conjunction) | عَلِمْتُ أَنَّ ٱللَّهَ عَلِيمٌ — "I knew that Allah is Knowing" |
| **كَأَنَّ** | kaʾanna | as if, as though | كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ — "As if they were donkeys" |
| **لَٰكِنَّ** | lākinna | but, however | لَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ قَدِيرٌ — "But Allah is Powerful" |
| **لَيْتَ** | layta | would that, I wish | لَيْتَ ٱلشَّبَابَ يَعُودُ — "Would that youth would return" |
| **لَعَلَّ** | laʿalla | perhaps, may | لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ — "Perhaps you will succeed" |
</GrammarTable>

**Key insight:** All six particles cause the SAME grammatical change: subject to accusative, predicate stays nominative. The difference is in meaning (emphasis, hope, contrast, etc.), not grammatical function.

### Before and After Comparison

Let's see exactly what changes when إِنَّ enters a sentence:

**BEFORE (Basic nominal sentence):**
- **ٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌ** (allāhu ghafūrun) — "Allah is Forgiving"
  - ٱللَّهُ (allāhu): subject (mubtadaʾ) — **nominative** with damma (ـُ)
  - غَفُورٌ (ghafūrun): predicate (khabar) — **nominative** with dammatain (ـٌ)

**AFTER (With إِنَّ added):**
- **إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ** (inna llāha ghafūrun) — "Indeed, Allah is Forgiving"
  - إِنَّ (inna): emphasis particle
  - ٱللَّهَ (allāha): name of inna (ism inna) — **accusative** with fatha (ـَ) ← **CHANGED**
  - غَفُورٌ (ghafūrun): predicate of inna (khabar inna) — **nominative** with dammatain (ـٌ) ← **UNCHANGED**

**Visual summary:**
```
Basic:     SUBJECT (nom. ـُ) + PREDICATE (nom. ـُ)
With إِنَّ:  إِنَّ + SUBJECT (acc. ـَ) + PREDICATE (nom. ـُ)
```

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine examples from Surah Al-Asr (103), which contains a perfect demonstration of إِنَّ modifying a nominal sentence.

### Example 1: إِنَّ with Definite Noun Subject

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ"
  transliteration="inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin"
  translation="Indeed, mankind is in loss"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:2"
  highlight="إِنَّ,ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ,خُسْرٍ"
/>

**Complete grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle
  - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Introduces emphasized nominal sentence

- **ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ** (al-insāna) — Name of inna (subject)
  - Function: Subject of nominal sentence (ism inna)
  - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
  - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative case

- **لَ** (la) — Additional emphasis particle
  - Function: Reinforcing emphasis
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Strengthens the assertion

- **فِى خُسْرٍ** (fī khusrin) — Predicate of inna
  - Function: Predicate of inna (khabar inna) — semi-sentence type
  - Case marker: Prepositional phrase (فِى is preposition, خُسْرٍ is **genitive** with kasra + tanwin)
  - Reason: Predicate of إِنَّ remains nominative (though here expressed as prepositional phrase)

**Structural insight:** The subject ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ changed from nominative (would be ٱلْإِنسَٰنُ in a basic sentence) to accusative because of إِنَّ. The predicate remains a prepositional phrase functioning as khabar.

### Example 2: إِلَّا Exception Following إِنَّ

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ"
  transliteration="illā lladhīna āmanū wa-ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāti"
  translation="Except those who believe and do righteous deeds"
  reference="Al-Asr 103:3"
  highlight="ٱلَّذِينَ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **إِلَّا** (illā) — Exception particle
  - Function: Introduces exception to previous statement
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Exception from "mankind is in loss"

- **ٱلَّذِينَ** (alladhīna) — Excepted noun
  - Function: The excepted group (mustathnā)
  - Case marker: **Accusative** (relative pronouns have fixed form)
  - Reason: Exception from the name of inna (ism inna) above

**Structural connection:** This exception relates back to ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ (the name of inna in verse 2). The structure is: "Indeed mankind is in loss — EXCEPT those who believe..." The exception takes accusative to match the case of what it's excepting from.

### Example 3: أَنَّ (That - Conjunction Form)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَبَشِّرِ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ أَنَّ لَهُمْ قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ عِندَ رَبِّهِمْ"
  transliteration="wa-bashshiri lladhīna āmanū anna lahum qadama ṣidqin ʿinda rabbihim"
  translation="And give good news to those who believe that they have a firm standing with their Lord"
  reference="Yunus 10:2"
  highlight="أَنَّ,لَهُمْ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **أَنَّ** (anna) — Conjunction particle ("that")
  - Function: Introduces content of good news
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Conjunction form of inna family

- **لَهُمْ** (lahum) — Prepositional phrase (name of anna)
  - Function: Subject of anna (ism anna) — prepositional phrase
  - Case: لَ is preposition, هُمْ is pronoun (fixed form)
  - Reason: The subject of أَنَّ can be a prepositional phrase placed first

- **قَدَمَ صِدْقٍ** (qadama ṣidqin) — Predicate of anna
  - **قَدَمَ** (qadama): Predicate (khabar anna) — **accusative** with fatha (ـَ)
  - Function: Predicate of anna
  - Case marker: Accusative (not nominative)
  - Reason: When subject of أَنَّ is a prepositional phrase, predicate takes accusative

**Advanced note:** This example shows a special pattern where the predicate-subject order is reversed (prepositional phrase first), causing the predicate to take accusative as well. This is an advanced structure you'll study more in Level 3.

### Example 4: لَٰكِنَّ (But/However - Contrast)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَٰكِنَّ ٱللَّهَ يَهْدِى مَن يَشَآءُ"
  transliteration="wa-lākinna llāha yahdī man yashāʾu"
  translation="But Allah guides whom He wills"
  reference="Al-Qasas 28:56"
  highlight="لَٰكِنَّ,ٱللَّهَ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **وَ** (wa) — Conjunction
  - Function: Conjunction "and"
  - Case: Particles don't take case

- **لَٰكِنَّ** (lākinna) — Contrast particle
  - Function: Introduces contrasting statement ("but")
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Member of inna family showing contrast

- **ٱللَّهَ** (allāha) — Name of lākinna
  - Function: Subject of lākinna (ism lākinna)
  - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
  - Reason: لَٰكِنَّ puts its subject in accusative (same rule as إِنَّ)

- **يَهْدِى** (yahdī) — Predicate of lākinna (verbal sentence)
  - Function: Predicate of lākinna (khabar lākinna) — complete verbal sentence
  - Case: Verbal sentence serving as predicate
  - Reason: The entire verbal sentence "guides whom He wills" is the khabar

**Structural insight:** The predicate here is a complete verbal sentence, not a single word. This shows the flexibility of khabar types even with inna sisters.

### Example 5: لَعَلَّ (Perhaps/May - Hope/Expectation)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَعَلَّكُمْ تُفْلِحُونَ"
  transliteration="laʿallakum tufliḥūna"
  translation="Perhaps you will succeed"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:189"
  highlight="لَعَلَّكُمْ,تُفْلِحُونَ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **لَعَلَّ** (laʿalla) — Hope particle
  - Function: Expresses hope or expectation ("perhaps")
  - Case: Particles don't take case
  - Reason: Member of inna family

- **كُمْ** (kum) — Name of laʿalla (attached pronoun)
  - Function: Subject of laʿalla (ism laʿalla) — attached pronoun "you (plural)"
  - Case marker: **Accusative** (attached pronouns have fixed forms)
  - Reason: لَعَلَّ puts its subject in accusative; attached to the particle

- **تُفْلِحُونَ** (tufliḥūna) — Predicate of laʿalla
  - Function: Predicate of laʿalla (khabar laʿalla) — verbal sentence
  - Case: Present tense verb with subject pronoun
  - Reason: Entire verbal sentence serves as khabar

**Structural note:** When the subject is an attached pronoun, it connects directly to the inna-family particle, forming one word (لَعَلَّكُمْ laʿallakum). The pronoun is still technically in accusative case as the ism, though attached pronouns don't show visible case changes.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**How Inna and Her Sisters Modify Nominal Sentences:**

When any of the six inna sisters enters a nominal sentence, the following changes occur:

**1. Subject (Mubtadaʾ) → Name of Inna (Ism Inna)**
- Changes from **nominative** to **accusative** case
- Marked by fatha (ـَ) on singular nouns
- Called اِسْمُ إِنَّ (ism inna) "name of inna"

**2. Predicate (Khabar) → Predicate of Inna (Khabar Inna)**
- **Remains nominative** case (unchanged)
- Marked by damma (ـُ) on singular nouns
- Called خَبَرُ إِنَّ (khabar inna) "predicate of inna"

**3. Meaning Impact:**
- إِنَّ / أَنَّ: Emphasis ("indeed", "that")
- كَأَنَّ: Comparison ("as if")
- لَٰكِنَّ: Contrast ("but", "however")
- لَيْتَ: Wish ("would that", "I wish")
- لَعَلَّ: Hope ("perhaps", "may")

**Formula:**
```
إِنَّ + SUBJECT (accusative ـَ) + PREDICATE (nominative ـُ)
```

**How to identify:** Look for one of the six particles at the start of a nominal sentence. The first noun after the particle is the subject in accusative; what follows is the predicate in nominative.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Mistakes:**

**Don't change BOTH parts to accusative.** Only the subject (ism inna) becomes accusative. The predicate (khabar inna) remains nominative. Many learners mistakenly think both change.

**Don't confuse إِنَّ (inna) with إِنْ (in).**
- **إِنَّ** (inna) with shadda: emphasis particle, causes grammatical change
- **إِنْ** (in) with sukūn: conditional particle "if", doesn't change case

Example contrast:
- **إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ غَفُورٌ** (inna llāha ghafūrun) — "Indeed Allah is Forgiving" (ٱللَّهَ accusative)
- **إِنْ جَآءَ ٱلنَّصْرُ** (in jāʾa n-naṣru) — "If help comes" (ٱلنَّصْرُ nominative)

**Don't forget the predicate can be a sentence.** Khabar inna doesn't have to be a single word — it can be an entire verbal sentence or prepositional phrase, just like in basic nominal sentences.

**Remember the word order flexibility.** While the typical pattern is إِنَّ + subject + predicate, Arabic allows the predicate (especially prepositional phrases) to come before the subject for emphasis.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 1: Identify the Inna Sister" difficulty="beginner">
Identify which inna-family particle is used in each sentence and what it means:

1. **إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ سَمِيعٌ** (inna llāha samīʿun) — "Indeed, Allah is All-Hearing"
2. **لَعَلَّ ٱللَّهَ يُحْدِثُ بَعْدَ ذَٰلِكَ أَمْرًا** (laʿalla llāha yuḥdidhu baʿda dhālika amran) — "Perhaps Allah will bring about a matter thereafter"
3. **كَأَنَّهُمْ حُمُرٌ** (kaʾannahum ḥumurun) — "As if they were donkeys"

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **إِنَّ** (inna) — "indeed, verily" — emphasis particle
   - Subject: ٱللَّهَ (allāha) — accusative
   - Predicate: سَمِيعٌ (samīʿun) — nominative

2. **لَعَلَّ** (laʿalla) — "perhaps, may" — hope/expectation particle
   - Subject: ٱللَّهَ (allāha) — accusative
   - Predicate: يُحْدِثُ (yuḥdithu) — verbal sentence (nominative function)

3. **كَأَنَّ** (kaʾanna) — "as if, as though" — comparison particle
   - Subject: هُمْ (hum) — attached pronoun "they" — accusative
   - Predicate: حُمُرٌ (ḥumurun) — nominative with dammatain

**Key insight:** All three particles put their subjects in accusative and keep predicates nominative, but each adds a different meaning (emphasis, hope, comparison).
</details>
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 2: Before and After Case Analysis" difficulty="intermediate">
Convert these basic nominal sentences by adding إِنَّ (inna). Show the case change on the subject:

1. **ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ نُورٌ** (aṣ-ṣalātu nūrun) — "Prayer is light"
2. **ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ** (al-muʾminūna ikhwatun) — "The believers are brothers"
3. **ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ** (al-ḥaqqu min rabbika) — "The truth is from your Lord"

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **BEFORE:** ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ نُورٌ (aṣ-ṣalātu nūrun)
   - ٱلصَّلَوٰةُ (aṣ-ṣalātu): subject — **nominative** (ـُ)

   **AFTER:** إِنَّ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ نُورٌ (inna ṣ-ṣalāta nūrun) — "Indeed, prayer is light"
   - ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ (aṣ-ṣalāta): ism inna — **accusative** (ـَ) ← CHANGED
   - نُورٌ (nūrun): khabar inna — **nominative** (ـٌ) ← UNCHANGED

2. **BEFORE:** ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ إِخْوَةٌ (al-muʾminūna ikhwatun)
   - ٱلْمُؤْمِنُونَ (al-muʾminūna): subject — **nominative** (ـُونَ)

   **AFTER:** إِنَّ ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ إِخْوَةٌ (inna l-muʾminīna ikhwatun) — "Indeed, the believers are brothers"
   - ٱلْمُؤْمِنِينَ (al-muʾminīna): ism inna — **accusative** (ـِينَ) ← CHANGED
   - إِخْوَةٌ (ikhwatun): khabar inna — **nominative** (ـٌ) ← UNCHANGED

3. **BEFORE:** ٱلْحَقُّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ (al-ḥaqqu min rabbika)
   - ٱلْحَقُّ (al-ḥaqqu): subject — **nominative** (ـُ)

   **AFTER:** إِنَّ ٱلْحَقَّ مِنْ رَبِّكَ (inna l-ḥaqqa min rabbika) — "Indeed, the truth is from your Lord"
   - ٱلْحَقَّ (al-ḥaqqa): ism inna — **accusative** (ـَ) ← CHANGED
   - مِنْ رَبِّكَ (min rabbika): khabar inna — prepositional phrase ← UNCHANGED

**Key insight:** Notice how sound masculine plural changes from ـُونَ (nominative) to ـِينَ (accusative) in example 2. Different noun types show accusative in different ways, but the grammatical function is the same.

"Indeed, Allah is over all things competent"
[Al-Baqarah 2:20]

Identify: (1) the inna particle, (2) the ism inna and its case, (3) the khabar inna and its case.

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**Complete grammatical analysis:**

1. **إِنَّ** (inna) — Emphasis particle
   - Function: Emphasis particle from inna family
   - Case: Particles don't take case
   - Reason: Introduces emphasized nominal sentence

2. **ٱللَّهَ** (allāha) — Name of inna (ism inna)
   - Function: Subject of inna sentence
   - Case marker: **Accusative with fatha (ـَ)**
   - Reason: إِنَّ puts its subject in accusative case

3. **عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ** (ʿalā kulli shayʾin) — Part of predicate (prepositional phrase)
   - عَلَىٰ (ʿalā): Preposition "over, upon"
   - كُلِّ (kulli): Genitive with kasra (follows preposition)
   - شَىْءٍۢ (shayʾin): Genitive with kasratain (second part of iḍāfah)
   - Function: Prepositional phrase modifying the predicate

4. **قَدِيرٌ** (qadīrun) — Predicate of inna (khabar inna)
   - Function: Predicate describing Allah's attribute
   - Case marker: **Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)**
   - Reason: Predicate of إِنَّ remains nominative

**Sentence structure:**
```
إِنَّ + SUBJECT (acc.) + PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE + PREDICATE (nom.)
إِنَّ   ٱللَّهَ        عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ     قَدِيرٌ
```

**Key insight:** The prepositional phrase عَلَىٰ كُلِّ شَىْءٍۢ modifies the predicate قَدِيرٌ ("competent over all things"). The predicate itself (قَدِيرٌ) remains nominative even though إِنَّ entered the sentence.

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 4: Sister Identification and Meaning" difficulty="advanced">
For each sentence, identify: (1) which inna sister is used, (2) the meaning it adds, (3) the case of the subject and predicate.

1. **لَٰكِنَّ ٱلرَّاسِخُونَ فِى ٱلْعِلْمِ** (lākinna r-rāsikhūna fi l-ʿilmi) — "But those firm in knowledge..."
2. **لَيْتَنِى كُنتُ تُرَٰبًا** (laytanī kuntu turāban) — "I wish I had been dust"
3. **كَأَنَّ ٱلْجِبَالَ ٱلْعِهْنُ** (kaʾanna l-jibāla l-ʿihnu) — "As if the mountains were wool"

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **لَٰكِنَّ** (lākinna) — "but, however" (contrast particle)
   - Meaning: Introduces contrasting statement
   - Subject: ٱلرَّاسِخُونَ (ar-rāsikhūna) — **nominative appearing** (ـُونَ)
     - **Wait!** This appears nominative (ـُونَ), but it should be accusative!
     - **Actually:** ٱلرَّاسِخِينَ would be accusative (ـِينَ)
     - **This is a special case:** When لَٰكِنَّ is followed by a subject that's also described by a following phrase, the sound masculine plural can maintain its nominative form. More advanced grammar (Level 3).
   - Function: Shows contrast with previous statement

2. **لَيْتَ** (layta) — "I wish, would that" (wish particle)
   - Meaning: Expresses unfulfilled wish or regret
   - Subject: ـنِى (-nī) attached pronoun "me" — **accusative** (attached to particle)
   - Predicate: كُنتُ تُرَٰبًا (kuntu turāban) — verbal sentence with كَانَ (kaana)
     - Function: Entire clause "I had been dust" serves as predicate
     - Note: This combines TWO modifying particles (لَيْتَ + كَانَ), showing layered grammar

3. **كَأَنَّ** (kaʾanna) — "as if, as though" (comparison particle)
   - Meaning: Creates comparison or simile
   - Subject: ٱلْجِبَالَ (al-jibāla) — **accusative** with fatha (ـَ)
   - Predicate: ٱلْعِهْنُ (al-ʿihnu) — **nominative** with damma (ـُ)
   - Function: Compares mountains to wool (scattered, light)

**Key insight:** Each sister adds a distinct semantic flavor (contrast, wish, comparison) while maintaining the same grammatical effect: accusative subject, nominative predicate. Advanced structures can layer multiple modifying particles.
