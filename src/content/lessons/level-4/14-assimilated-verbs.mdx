## Introduction

You've mastered hollow verbs (middle-weak) and defective verbs (final-weak). Now you're ready for the SIMPLEST weak verb category: assimilated verbs (al-mithal). These are verbs with a weak letter (usually و, rarely ي) in the INITIAL position that drops in present tense.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā"
  translation="And He found you lost and guided [you]"
  reference="Al-Duha 93:7"
  highlight="وَجَدَكَ"
/>

The word **وَجَدَكَ** (wajadaka) "He found you" is from the assimilated verb وَجَدَ (wajada) with root و-ج-د (w-j-d). In past tense, all three root letters appear. But in present tense, it becomes يَجِدُ (yajidu) — the initial و DROPS. This is the assimilated verb pattern: the initial و disappears in present tense Form I, making these verbs look like they start with the second root letter.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand the initial-waw deletion RULE (simplest of all weak verb patterns)
- Compare sound vs assimilated verb conjugation side by side
- Learn when the waw STAYS (past tense, derived forms II-X)
- Recognize common assimilated roots with transliteration
- Apply assimilated verb analysis to Al-Duha examples

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.12 Hollow Verbs](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs/), you learned middle-weak contraction (3 principles). In [L4.13 Defective Verbs](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/), you learned final-weak transformation (mood interaction). Assimilated verbs are MUCH SIMPLER — just ONE rule: initial و drops in present tense Form I.

**Forward connection:** After assimilated verbs, [L4.15 Hamzated Verbs](/learn/level-4/15-hamzated-verbs/) completes the weak verb system with hamza spelling rules. You'll then have mastered ALL four weak verb categories!

**Key insight:** Assimilated verbs are called "the easy weak verbs" by Arabic grammarians. Only Form I present tense is affected — everything else conjugates like sound verbs. This makes them the fastest weak verb category to master.

## Understanding Assimilated Verbs

**Plain English first:** Imagine a shy person at a party. When everyone's looking (past tense, derived forms), they show up. But when they can blend into the background (present tense Form I), they disappear. Assimilated verbs work the same way: the initial و is "shy" and drops when it can (present tense), but stays when it must (past tense, other forms).

### What Makes a Verb "Assimilated"?

**[Assimilated verb](/resources/glossary/#fil-mithal)** (fiʿl mithāl / فِعْلٌ مِثَالٌ) — verb with weak letter (و or rarely ي) in the INITIAL position (1st radical)

**Examples:**
- **و-ج-د** (w-j-d) "finding" → initial و
- **و-ص-ل** (w-ṣ-l) "arriving/connecting" → initial و
- **و-ق-ف** (w-q-f) "standing/stopping" → initial و
- **و-ع-د** (w-ʿ-d) "promising" → initial و
- **ي-س-ر** (y-s-r) "being easy" (rare initial-ya) → initial ي

**Why "assimilated"?** The Arabic term مِثَالٌ (mithāl) means "like/resembling" or "example/pattern." The verb is named after the WORD used to demonstrate weak letter position in grammar books: مِثَالٌ itself contains و as first radical (original root و-ث-ل, though rarely used as verb). The initial weak letter "assimilates" (disappears into) the following consonant in present tense.

### Sound vs Assimilated: The Core Difference

Let's compare a sound verb with an assimilated verb to see the pattern:

<GrammarTable>
| Form | Sound: ن-ص-ر (helping) | Assimilated: و-ج-د (finding) | Difference |
|------|----------------------|---------------------------|------------|
| **Root** | ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r) | و-ج-د (w-j-d) | First letter is و (weak) |
| **Past 3MS** | نَصَرَ (naṣara) | وَجَدَ (wajada) | و appears |
| **Present 3MS** | يَنْصُرُ (yanṣuru) | يَجِدُ (yajidu) | و DROPS! |
| **Imperative 2MS** | ٱُنْصُرْ (unṣur) | جِدْ (jid) | و drops |
| **Pattern** | All three radicals visible | Initial و drops in present | Weak letter disappears |
</GrammarTable>

**Key observation:** The sound verb ن-ص-ر keeps all three root letters visible in every form. The assimilated verb و-ج-د's initial و behaves differently:
- In past tense: و appears (وَجَدَ wajada)
- In present tense: و DROPS (يَجِدُ yajidu, not *يَوْجِدُ)
- In imperative: و drops (جِدْ jid, not *ٱِوْجِدْ)

This is the SIMPLEST weak verb pattern — just one change!

## The Core Deletion Rule

**THE RULE: Initial و drops in present tense Form I**

When conjugating assimilated verbs in present tense Form I, the initial و DELETES.

**Pattern:** Root و-ف-ع → Past وَفَعَ (wafaʿa) → Present يَفْعَلُ (yafʿalu) NOT *يَوْفَعُ

**Examples:**
- **و-ج-د** → Past: وَجَدَ (wajada) → Present: يَجِدُ (yajidu)
- **و-ص-ل** → Past: وَصَلَ (waṣala) → Present: يَصِلُ (yaṣilu)
- **و-ق-ف** → Past: وَقَفَ (waqafa) → Present: يَقِفُ (yaqifu)
- **و-ع-د** → Past: وَعَدَ (waʿada) → Present: يَعِدُ (yaʿidu)

**Why does the و drop?** Arabic phonology finds the consonant cluster يَوْـ (ya-w) at the start of present tense awkward. For ease of pronunciation, the و assimilates into the following consonant, effectively disappearing.

<Callout type="info" title="Compare with Sound Verb">

Sound verb present: يَنْصُرُ (yan-ṣu-ru) — prefix يَ + root ن-ص-ر
Assimilated present: يَجِدُ (ya-ji-du) — prefix يَ + ج-د (و dropped!)

The assimilated verb looks like a two-letter root in present tense, but it's actually three letters with the first one hidden.

</Callout>

<Callout type="rule" title="The Simplest Weak Verb Rule">

**Initial و drops in present tense Form I. That's it.**

- Past tense? و stays: وَجَدَ (wajada)
- Form II-X? و stays: وَاصَلَ (wāṣala) Form III
- Only present/imperative Form I? و drops: يَجِدُ (yajidu), جِدْ (jid)

This is why assimilated verbs are called "easy" — memorize ONE rule, and you're done!

</Callout>

## When the Waw STAYS

Understanding WHEN the initial و stays is just as important as knowing when it drops.

### 1. Past Tense (All Forms)

In past tense, the initial و ALWAYS appears:

**Form I past:**
- وَجَدَ (wajada) "he found"
- وَصَلَ (waṣala) "he arrived"
- وَقَفَ (waqafa) "he stood"
- وَعَدَ (waʿada) "he promised"

The و is fully visible and conjugates normally with past tense suffixes.

### 2. Derived Forms (II-X)

In derived forms (II through X), the initial و STAYS in BOTH past and present:

**Examples from و-ص-ل (w-ṣ-l):**
- **Form II:** وَصَّلَ (waṣṣala) / يُوَصِّلُ (yuwaṣṣilu) "to connect/link"
- **Form IV:** أَوْصَلَ (awṣala) / يُوصِلُ (yūṣilu) "to deliver/convey"
- **Form V:** تَوَصَّلَ (tawaṣṣala) / يَتَوَصَّلُ (yatawaṣṣalu) "to reach/arrive at"

**Why و stays in derived forms:** The augmentation letters in Forms II-X create different syllable structures that don't have the awkward يَوْـ cluster. So the و doesn't need to drop.

### 3. Imperative Exception Pattern

**Standard imperative:** The و drops like in present tense:
- وَجَدَ → Present يَجِدُ → Imperative جِدْ (jid) "find!"
- وَقَفَ → Present يَقِفُ → Imperative قِفْ (qif) "stop!"

But some grammars note the imperative can OPTIONALLY keep the و in classical usage (rare):
- Rare: ٱِوْجِدْ (iwjid) alongside common جِدْ (jid)

**For Quranic reading:** The short form (و dropped) is standard.

## Common Assimilated Roots with Transliteration

Here's a reference table of the most frequent assimilated verbs in Quranic Arabic:

<GrammarTable>
| Root | Past (3MS) | Trans. | Present (3MS) | Trans. | Imperative (2MS) | Trans. | Meaning |
|------|-----------|--------|---------------|--------|------------------|--------|---------|
| و-ج-د | وَجَدَ | wajada | يَجِدُ | yajidu | جِدْ | jid | find |
| و-ص-ل | وَصَلَ | waṣala | يَصِلُ | yaṣilu | صِلْ | ṣil | arrive/connect |
| و-ق-ف | وَقَفَ | waqafa | يَقِفُ | yaqifu | قِفْ | qif | stand/stop |
| و-ع-د | وَعَدَ | waʿada | يَعِدُ | yaʿidu | عِدْ | ʿid | promise |
| و-ض-ع | وَضَعَ | waḍaʿa | يَضَعُ | yaḍaʿu | ضَعْ | ḍaʿ | put/place |
| و-ل-د | وَلَدَ | walada | يَلِدُ | yalidu | لِدْ | lid | give birth/beget |
| و-ر-ث | وَرِثَ | waritha | يَرِثُ | yarithu | رِثْ | rith | inherit |
| و-ق-ي | وَقَى | waqā | يَقِي | yaqī | قِ | qi | protect |
| ي-س-ر | يَسَرَ | yasara | يَيْسِرُ | yaysiru | ٱِيْسِرْ | aysir | be easy (rare ي-initial) |
</GrammarTable>

**Pattern note:** In present tense column, notice the initial letter is NEVER و — it's always the second root consonant. The و has completely disappeared.

**Transliteration comparison:**
- Past: wa-ja-da, wa-ṣa-la (3 syllables, و pronounced)
- Present: ya-ji-du, ya-ṣi-lu (3 syllables, و absent)
- The syllable count stays the same, but the initial consonant changes!

## Side-by-Side Conjugation: Sound vs Assimilated

Let's conjugate two verbs completely to see the deletion pattern:

<VerbConjugation
  title="Present Tense Comparison: يَنْصُرُ (sound) vs يَجِدُ (assimilated)"
  soundRoot="ن-ص-ر"
  hollowRoot="و-ج-د"
>

**Sound Verb: يَنْصُرُ (yanṣuru) "he helps"**

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Pattern |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------|
| 3MS (he) | يَنْصُرُ | yanṣuru | All root letters visible |
| 3FS (she) | تَنْصُرُ | tanṣuru | All root letters visible |
| 3MD (they two) | يَنْصُرَانِ | yanṣurāni | All root letters visible |
| 3FD (they two) | تَنْصُرَانِ | tanṣurāni | All root letters visible |
| 3MP (they) | يَنْصُرُونَ | yanṣurūna | All root letters visible |
| 3FP (they) | يَنْصُرْنَ | yanṣurna | All root letters visible |
| 2MS (you) | تَنْصُرُ | tanṣuru | All root letters visible |
| 2FS (you) | تَنْصُرِينَ | tanṣurīna | All root letters visible |
| 1S (I) | أَنْصُرُ | anṣuru | All root letters visible |
| 1P (we) | نَنْصُرُ | nanṣuru | All root letters visible |

**Assimilated Verb: يَجِدُ (yajidu) "he finds"**

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Pattern |
|--------|--------|----------------|---------|
| 3MS (he) | يَجِدُ | yajidu | Initial و DELETED |
| 3FS (she) | تَجِدُ | tajidu | Initial و DELETED |
| 3MD (they two) | يَجِدَانِ | yajidāni | Initial و DELETED |
| 3FD (they two) | تَجِدَانِ | tajidāni | Initial و DELETED |
| 3MP (they) | يَجِدُونَ | yajidūna | Initial و DELETED |
| 3FP (they) | يَجِدْنَ | yajidna | Initial و DELETED |
| 2MS (you) | تَجِدُ | tajidu | Initial و DELETED |
| 2FS (you) | تَجِدِينَ | tajidīna | Initial و DELETED |
| 1S (I) | أَجِدُ | ajidu | Initial و DELETED |
| 1P (we) | نَجِدُ | najidu | Initial و DELETED |

</VerbConjugation>

**Critical observation:** In present tense conjugation, the assimilated verb NEVER shows the initial و. It conjugates exactly like a sound verb, but starting with the SECOND root letter.

**Pattern consistency:** The deletion happens in ALL persons, ALL numbers, ALL genders. There are NO exceptions in present tense Form I — the و always drops.

## Past Tense: Waw Appears Normally

Let's see the same verb وَجَدَ in past tense where the و STAYS:

<VerbConjugation
  title="Past Tense: وَجَدَ (wajada) 'he found'"
  root="و-ج-د"
>

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Pattern Note |
|--------|--------|----------------|--------------|
| 3MS (he) | وَجَدَ | wajada | و fully visible |
| 3FS (she) | وَجَدَتْ | wajad at | و stays |
| 3MD (they two) | وَجَدَا | wajadā | و stays |
| 3FD (they two) | وَجَدَتَا | wajadatā | و stays |
| 3MP (they) | وَجَدُوْا | wajadū | و stays |
| 3FP (they) | وَجَدْنَ | wajadna | و stays |
| 2MS (you) | وَجَدْتَ | wajadta | و stays |
| 2FS (you) | وَجَدْتِ | wajadti | و stays |
| 2MD/FD (you two) | وَجَدْتُمَاْ | wajadtumā | و stays |
| 2MP (you) | وَجَدْتُمْ | wajadtum | و stays |
| 2FP (you) | وَجَدْتُنَّ | wajadtunna | و stays |
| 1S (I) | وَجَدْتُ | wajadtu | و stays |
| 1P (we) | وَجَدْنَا | wajadnā | و stays |

</VerbConjugation>

**Key insight:** In past tense, assimilated verbs conjugate EXACTLY like sound verbs. The و behaves like a normal consonant. Only in present tense Form I does the special deletion rule apply.

## Examples from Al-Duha

Let's analyze assimilated verbs from Surah Al-Duha (Chapter 93), designated for this lesson:

### Example 1: وَجَدَكَ (wajadaka) — Past Tense

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā"
  translation="And He found you lost and guided [you]"
  reference="Al-Duha 93:7"
  highlight="وَجَدَكَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **وَجَدَكَ** (wajadaka)
  - Root: و-ج-د (w-j-d) "finding"
  - Verb form: Form I assimilated
  - Tense: Past tense, 3rd person masculine singular
  - Pattern: وَفَعَلَ (wafaʿala) — و fully visible in past
  - Attached pronoun: كَ (ka) "you" (2MS object)
  - Translation: "He found you"

**Pattern note:** In past tense, the initial و appears normally. Allah (the implied subject "He") found the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) in a state of being lost (ضَآلًّا) and guided him.

This demonstrates the theological theme of divine guidance — Allah FINDS (وَجَدَ) those who are lost and GUIDES (هَدَىٰ, defective verb from previous lesson!) them.

### Example 2: Present Tense Pattern

While Al-Duha uses past tense وَجَدَكَ, let's see how this verb appears in present tense elsewhere in the Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَا تَجِدُ لَهُمْ مِنْ دُونِ ٱللَّهِ وَلِيًّا وَلَا نَصِيرًا"
  transliteration="wa-lā tajidu lahum min dūni llāhi waliyyan wa-lā naṣīran"
  translation="And you will not find for them besides Allah any protector or helper"
  reference="An-Nisa 4:173"
  highlight="تَجِدُ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **تَجِدُ** (tajidu)
  - Root: و-ج-د (w-j-d) "finding"
  - Verb form: Form I assimilated
  - Tense: Present tense indicative, 2nd person masculine singular
  - Pattern: تَفْعِلُ (tafʿilu) — initial و DELETED
  - Negation: لَا (lā) "not" precedes verb
  - Translation: "you (will) find"

**Deletion demonstration:** The root is و-ج-د, but in present tense it becomes تَجِدُ (ta-ji-du), not *تَوْجِدُ. The و has completely disappeared, leaving only ج-د visible.

### Example 3: Al-Duha Context — Theological Significance

Let's see the full context of the assimilated verb in Al-Duha:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَـَٔاوَىٰ ۝ وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّا فَهَدَىٰ ۝ وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ"
  transliteration="a-lam yajidka yatīman fa-āwā wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā wa-wajadaka ʿāʾilan fa-aghnā"
  translation="Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge? And He found you lost and guided [you]. And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient."
  reference="Al-Duha 93:6-8"
  highlight="يَجِدْكَ"
/>

**Three parallel structures using و-ج-د:**

1. **يَجِدْكَ** (yajidka) — Present tense jussive (after أَلَمْ) "Did He find you?"
   - Root: و-ج-د → يَجِدُ (present) → يَجِدْ (jussive, و deleted)

2. **وَجَدَكَ** (wajadaka) — Past tense "He found you" (×2)
   - Root: و-ج-د → وَجَدَ (past, و appears)

**Mixed tense demonstration:** Verse 6 uses present/jussive (يَجِدْكَ) while verses 7-8 use past (وَجَدَكَ). This shows the و deletion (present) vs و appearance (past) in the SAME ROOT within three consecutive verses!

<Callout type="info" title="Al-Duha's Theological Message">

Surah Al-Duha consoles the Prophet (ﷺ) by reminding him of Allah's past favors:
- Found you an orphan → gave refuge
- Found you lost → guided
- Found you poor → enriched

The verb وَجَدَ (wajada) "to find" emphasizes Allah's ACTIVE seeking and care. Allah doesn't wait for us to be perfect — He FINDS us in our weakness and transforms us.

Understanding the assimilated verb و-ج-د unlocks this powerful message of divine providence.

## Summary

You've now mastered assimilated verbs — the SIMPLEST weak verb category:

**Key concepts:**
1. **Assimilated verbs:** Initial weak letter (usually و) that drops in present tense Form I
2. **THE rule:** Initial و deletes in present/imperative Form I ONLY
3. **When و stays:** Past tense (all forms), derived forms II-X
4. **Pronunciation:** Present tense sounds like two-letter root, but it's still three

**Common assimilated verbs to remember:**
- وَجَدَ (wajada) / يَجِدُ (yajidu) — find
- وَصَلَ (waṣala) / يَصِلُ (yaṣilu) — arrive/connect
- وَقَفَ (waqafa) / يَقِفُ (yaqifu) — stand/stop
- وَعَدَ (waʿada) / يَعِدُ (yaʿidu) — promise
- وَضَعَ (waḍaʿa) / يَضَعُ (yaḍaʿu) — put/place

**Why assimilated verbs are "easy":**
- Only ONE rule to memorize (vs hollow verbs' 3 principles, defective verbs' mood interactions)
- Only affects Form I present/imperative
- No subtypes to distinguish (unlike hollow waw/ya or defective waw/ya)
- Past tense conjugates exactly like sound verbs

**Critical insight:** When you see a present tense verb that LOOKS like it's missing a root letter, check if the root starts with و — it's probably an assimilated verb! The "missing" letter is hiding in the root, not in the conjugated form.

**Weak verb mastery progress:**
- ✓ [L4.12 Hollow Verbs](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs/) — Middle-weak (3 contraction principles)
- ✓ [L4.13 Defective Verbs](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/) — Final-weak (mood interaction)
- ✓ **L4.14 Assimilated Verbs** — Initial-weak (simple deletion)
- → Next: [L4.15 Hamzated Verbs](/learn/level-4/15-hamzated-verbs/) — Hamza spelling

**Remember:** Assimilated verbs are your friends! Learn ONE simple rule (initial و drops in present Form I), and you've mastered the category. No complex transformations, no mood variations, just straightforward deletion. This is the reward for working through hollow and defective verbs first!
