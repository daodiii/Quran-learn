## Introduction

Arabic expresses if-then relationships through conditional sentences — one of the most sophisticated structures in the language. These sentences appear throughout the Quran in commands, warnings, and promises.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ"
  transliteration="in kuntum ṣādiqīna"
  translation="if you are truthful"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:23"
  highlight="إِن كُنتُمْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِن", tr: "in", en: "if" },
    { ar: "كُنتُمْ", tr: "kuntum", en: "you are" },
    { ar: "صَٰدِقِينَ", tr: "ṣādiqīna", en: "truthful" }
  ]}
/>

The particle **إِنْ** (in) "if" sets up a condition, and notice how the verb **كُنتُمْ** (kuntum) changes form — it's in the jussive mood, marked by the deletion of the final nūn. This mood change is the key to recognizing conditional sentences in Arabic.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand the three-part conditional sentence structure (particle + condition + result)
- Recognize how conditional particles trigger verb mood changes
- Identify the jussive markers that signal conditional relationships
- Analyze conditional sentences in Quranic commands and warnings
- Distinguish between إِنْ (conditional "if") and إِنَّ (emphatic "indeed")

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L2.03 Verbal Sentences](/learn/level-2/03-verbal-sentence/), you learned how verbal sentences work with their verb-subject-object structure. Conditional sentences are COMPOUND verbal sentences — two verbal sentences joined by an if-then relationship. The "if" part is the condition (**shart** / شَرْطٌ), and the "then" part is the result (**jawab** / جَوَابٌ).

**Forward connection:** This lesson establishes the basic structure. In [L4.04 Types of Conditional Particles](/learn/level-4/04-conditional-particles/), you'll learn how different particles (إِنْ, إِذَا, لَوْ) change the meaning and certainty level of conditionals.

## Understanding Conditional Sentences

**Plain English first:** Arabic conditionals work like English if-then statements: "If X happens, then Y will happen." But Arabic does something English doesn't — the verb forms CHANGE based on the conditional particle. The key insight: the particle controls the mood of BOTH verbs (the condition verb AND the result verb).

**English comparison:**

In English, we keep the same verb forms:
- "If he **comes**, I **will help**" (present → future)
- "If he **came**, I **would help**" (past → conditional)

In Arabic, BOTH verbs change to show they're conditional. It's like English subjunctive: "If he **were to come**, then I **were to help**" — except Arabic has a specific mood marker (jussive) that makes this visible in the verb ending.

### Arabic Terminology

**Conditional particle** — [أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ](/resources/glossary/#adat-ash-shart) (adātu sh-sharṭi / particle of condition)

This is the "if" word that introduces the conditional relationship. The most common is **إِنْ** (in), but there are others like إِذَا (idhā) "when," لَوْ (law) "if only," and مَنْ (man) "whoever."

**Condition clause** — [جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ](/resources/glossary/#jumlat-ash-shart) (jumlatu sh-sharṭi / sentence of condition)

This is the "if" clause — the hypothetical situation being proposed. It always contains a verb (usually present tense in form, but conditional in meaning).

**Result clause** — [جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ](/resources/glossary/#jawab-ash-shart) (jawābu sh-sharṭi / answer of condition)

This is the "then" clause — what happens if the condition is fulfilled. Some grammarians also call this **jazāʾ** (جَزَاءٌ / reward or consequence).

### The Three-Part Structure

Every conditional sentence has exactly three components:

```
[أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ] + [جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ] + [جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ]
   Particle     +    Condition      +      Result
     إِنْ        +   تَنْصُرُوا۟ اللَّهَ  +    يَنصُرْكُمْ
     If          +   you support Allah +  He will support you
```

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِن تَنْصُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ"
  transliteration="in tanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum"
  translation="If you support Allah, He will support you"
  reference="Muhammad 47:7"
  highlight="تَنْصُرُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِن", tr: "in", en: "if" },
    { ar: "تَنْصُرُوا۟", tr: "tanṣurū", en: "you support" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهَ", tr: "llāha", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "يَنصُرْكُمْ", tr: "yanṣurkum", en: "He will support you" }
  ]}
/>

Notice three things:
1. **إِنْ** — the conditional particle
2. **تَنْصُرُوا۟** — the condition verb (you support) — jussive mood
3. **يَنصُرْكُمْ** — the result verb (He will support) — also jussive mood

Both verbs changed form because of إِنْ.

## Mood Changes in Conditional Sentences

Here's where Arabic gets sophisticated: when certain conditional particles are used (especially **إِنْ**), BOTH the condition verb and the result verb must take the **jussive mood** (مَجْزُومٌ / majzūm).

You learned in [L3.04 Past & Present Tense](/learn/level-3/03-past-tense/) that present tense verbs normally end in ḍamma (ـُ) for indicative mood. In conditional sentences with إِنْ, that changes to jussive mood with visible markers:

### Jussive Mood Markers

**For plural verbs ending in -ūna:**
- **Indicative:** تَنْصُرُونَ (tanṣurūna) "you (plural) support" — with final nūn
- **Jussive:** تَنْصُرُوا۟ (tanṣurū) "you (plural) support" — nūn DELETED

**For dual verbs and feminine plural:**
- **Indicative:** تَنْصُرَانِ (tanṣurāni) / تَنصُرْنَ (tanṣurna) — with final nūn
- **Jussive:** تَنْصُرَا (tanṣurā) / تَنصُرْنَ (tanṣurna) — nūn DELETED (for dual)

**For singular verbs:**
- **Indicative:** يَنصُرُ (yanṣuru) — with ḍamma
- **Jussive:** يَنصُرْ (yanṣur) — with sukūn

The jussive mood is called majzūm (مَجْزُومٌ) because **jazm** (جَزْمٌ) means "cutting off" — the verb ending is "cut" or shortened.

### How to Spot Jussive Mood

Look for these signs:
1. **Deleted nūn** (ن) — most obvious marker for plurals and duals
2. **Sukūn** (ـْ) on final letter — for singular masculine verbs
3. **Context** — appears after conditional particles like إِنْ

<GrammarTable>
| Verb | Indicative (Normal) | Jussive (Conditional) | What Changed |
|------|---------------------|----------------------|--------------|
| يَكْتُبُ (he writes) | يَكْتُبُ (yaktubu) | يَكْتُبْ (yaktub) | Final ḍamma → sukūn |
| تَكْتُبُونَ (you write) | تَكْتُبُونَ (taktubūna) | تَكْتُبُوا۟ (taktubū) | Final nūn deleted |
| يَكْتُبَانِ (they two write) | يَكْتُبَانِ (yaktubāni) | يَكْتُبَا (yaktubā) | Final nūn deleted |
| تَكْتُبْنَ (you fem write) | تَكْتُبْنَ (taktubna) | تَكْتُبْنَ (taktubna) | No change (already sukūn) |
</GrammarTable>

**Key principle:** When إِنْ introduces a conditional, check BOTH verbs for jussive markers. The condition clause AND the result clause both take jussive mood.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's analyze complete conditional sentences from Surah Al-Baqarah to see the structure in context.

### Example 1: Conditional Challenge

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَإِن كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍۢ مِّمَّا نَزَّلْنَا عَلَىٰ عَبْدِنَا فَأْتُوا۟ بِسُورَةٍۢ مِّن مِّثْلِهِۦ"
  transliteration="wa in kuntum fī raybin mimmā nazzalnā ʿalā ʿabdinā fa'tū bi-sūratin min mithlihi"
  translation="And if you are in doubt about what We have sent down upon Our Servant, then produce a surah the like thereof"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:23"
  highlight="إِن كُنتُمْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَإِن", tr: "wa in", en: "and if" },
    { ar: "كُنتُمْ", tr: "kuntum", en: "you are" },
    { ar: "فِى", tr: "fī", en: "in" },
    { ar: "رَيْبٍۢ", tr: "raybin", en: "doubt" },
    { ar: "مِّمَّا", tr: "mimmā", en: "about what" },
    { ar: "نَزَّلْنَا", tr: "nazzalnā", en: "We have sent down" },
    { ar: "عَلَىٰ", tr: "ʿalā", en: "upon" },
    { ar: "عَبْدِنَا", tr: "ʿabdinā", en: "Our Servant" },
    { ar: "فَأْتُوا۟", tr: "fa'tū", en: "then produce" },
    { ar: "بِسُورَةٍۢ", tr: "bi-sūratin", en: "a surah" },
    { ar: "مِّن", tr: "min", en: "of" },
    { ar: "مِّثْلِهِۦ", tr: "mithlihi", en: "the like thereof" }
  ]}
/>

**Structure breakdown:**
- **Particle:** وَإِن (wa in) — "and if"
- **Condition:** كُنتُمْ فِى رَيْبٍۢ (kuntum fī raybin) — "you are in doubt" (jussive)
- **Result:** فَأْتُوا۟ بِسُورَةٍۢ (fa'tū bi-sūratin) — "then produce a surah" (imperative with فَ)

**Morphological i'rab:**
- **كُنتُمْ** — Root: ك-و-ن (k-w-n), Form: I hollow verb (past tense form used), Function: condition verb, Mood: serves as condition after إِنْ

Note: **كَانَ** (kāna) "to be" uses past tense forms in present conditional meaning. The jussive is visible in the **deleted nūn**: the normal form would be كُنْتُمُونَ, but in conditional it becomes كُنتُمْ.

**Result with فَ:** When the result clause is an **imperative** (command), it must be introduced by **فَ** (fa) "then/so." The فَ links the result to the condition.

### Example 2: Support and Victory

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِن تَنْصُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ"
  transliteration="in tanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum wa yuthabbit aqdāmakum"
  translation="If you support Allah, He will support you and make firm your feet"
  reference="Muhammad 47:7"
  highlight="تَنْصُرُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِن", tr: "in", en: "if" },
    { ar: "تَنْصُرُوا۟", tr: "tanṣurū", en: "you support" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهَ", tr: "llāha", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "يَنصُرْكُمْ", tr: "yanṣurkum", en: "He will support you" },
    { ar: "وَيُثَبِّتْ", tr: "wa yuthabbit", en: "and make firm" },
    { ar: "أَقْدَامَكُمْ", tr: "aqdāmakum", en: "your feet" }
  ]}
/>

**Structure breakdown:**
- **Particle:** إِن (in) — "if"
- **Condition:** تَنْصُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ (tanṣurū llāha) — "you support Allah" (jussive — nūn deleted)
- **Result:** يَنصُرْكُمْ (yanṣurkum) — "He will support you" (jussive — sukūn on ص)

**Morphological i'rab:**
- **تَنْصُرُوا۟** — Root: ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r), Form: I, Tense: present, Person: 2nd plural, Function: condition verb, Mood: jussive (majzūm) marked by deletion of final nūn, Reason: falls after conditional particle إِنْ
- **يَنصُرْكُمْ** — Root: ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r), Form: I, Tense: present, Person: 3rd singular, Function: result verb, Mood: jussive (majzūm) marked by sukūn on final letter, Reason: jawāb ash-sharṭ (result of condition)

**Double result:** Notice وَيُثَبِّتْ (wa yuthabbit) "and make firm" — a second result verb, also in jussive mood with sukūn on ت. Multiple results can be chained with wāw (وَ).

### Example 3: Belief and Good Deeds

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ وَعَمِلُوا۟ ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ"
  transliteration="inna lladhīna āmanū wa ʿamilū ṣ-ṣāliḥāti"
  translation="Indeed, those who believed and did righteous deeds"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:25"
  highlight="إِنَّ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّ", tr: "inna", en: "indeed" },
    { ar: "ٱلَّذِينَ", tr: "lladhīna", en: "those who" },
    { ar: "ءَامَنُوا۟", tr: "āmanū", en: "believed" },
    { ar: "وَعَمِلُوا۟", tr: "wa ʿamilū", en: "and did" },
    { ar: "ٱلصَّٰلِحَٰتِ", tr: "ṣ-ṣāliḥāti", en: "righteous deeds" }
  ]}
/>

**CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** This is NOT a conditional sentence!

Notice **إِنَّ** (inna) with **shadda** (double nūn) — this is the emphatic particle meaning "indeed/verily," not the conditional particle إِنْ. The shadda makes all the difference:

- **إِنْ** (in) — one nūn with sukūn — CONDITIONAL "if"
- **إِنَّ** (inna) — doubled nūn with shadda — EMPHATIC "indeed"

The verbs after إِنَّ do NOT change to jussive mood. This is one of the most common reading errors for learners.

### Example 4: Protection from Hypocrisy

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَإِن تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌۭ يَقُولُوا۟ هَٰذِهِۦ مِنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="wa in tuṣibhum ḥasanatun yaqūlū hādhihi min ʿindi llāhi"
  translation="And if a good thing befalls them, they say: This is from Allah"
  reference="An-Nisa 4:78"
  highlight="تُصِبْهُمْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَإِن", tr: "wa in", en: "and if" },
    { ar: "تُصِبْهُمْ", tr: "tuṣibhum", en: "befalls them" },
    { ar: "حَسَنَةٌۭ", tr: "ḥasanatun", en: "a good thing" },
    { ar: "يَقُولُوا۟", tr: "yaqūlū", en: "they say" },
    { ar: "هَٰذِهِۦ", tr: "hādhihi", en: "this is" },
    { ar: "مِنْ", tr: "min", en: "from" },
    { ar: "عِندِ", tr: "ʿindi", en: "with/near" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "Allah" }
  ]}
/>

**Structure breakdown:**
- **Particle:** وَإِن (wa in) — "and if"
- **Condition:** تُصِبْهُمْ حَسَنَةٌۭ (tuṣibhum ḥasanatun) — "befalls them a good thing" (jussive)
- **Result:** يَقُولُوا۟ (yaqūlū) — "they say" (jussive — nūn deleted)

**Morphological i'rab:**
- **تُصِبْهُمْ** — Root: ص-و-ب (ṣ-w-b), Form: IV (أَصَابَ), Tense: present, Person: 3rd singular feminine, Function: condition verb, Mood: jussive marked by sukūn on ب, Reason: falls after إِنْ
- **يَقُولُوا۟** — Root: ق-و-ل (q-w-l), Form: I, Tense: present, Person: 3rd plural, Function: result verb, Mood: jussive marked by deletion of final nūn, Reason: jawāb ash-sharṭ

**Subject position:** Notice حَسَنَةٌۭ (ḥasanatun) "a good thing" is the SUBJECT (فَاعِلٌ / fāʿilun) in nominative case, coming AFTER the verb — standard VSO order in verbal sentences.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
A conditional sentence has three parts:

1. **Conditional particle** (أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ) — such as إِنْ (in) "if"
2. **Condition clause** (جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ) — the "if" part with a verb
3. **Result clause** (جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ) — the "then" part with a verb

When **إِنْ** is used, BOTH the condition verb AND the result verb take **jussive mood** (مَجْزُومٌ / majzūm). Jussive markers include:
- Deletion of final nūn (ن) for plural/dual verbs
- Sukūn (ـْ) on final letter for singular verbs

The result clause may need **فَ** (fa) before it when the result is:
- An imperative (command)
- A nominal sentence
- A sentence starting with certain particles (قَدْ, سَ, لَنْ, مَا)
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't forget mood changes:** The particle إِنْ requires jussive mood in BOTH clauses — both the condition AND the result. Don't leave the result verb in indicative mood (with final ḍamma or nūn).

❌ **Wrong:** إِن تَكْتُبْ أَقْرَأُ (in taktub aqraʾu) — result verb should be jussive
✓ **Correct:** إِن تَكْتُبْ أَقْرَأْ (in taktub aqraʾ) — both verbs jussive

**Don't confuse إِنْ with إِنَّ:** The shadda makes all the difference:
- **إِنْ** (in) — conditional "if" → verbs change to jussive
- **إِنَّ** (inna) — emphatic "indeed" → no mood change

❌ **Wrong:** Reading إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ as a conditional
✓ **Correct:** Recognizing إِنَّ as emphatic particle, not conditional

**Watch for فَ before the result:** When the result clause is an imperative, nominal sentence, or starts with certain particles, it MUST be introduced by فَ (fa).

✓ **Correct:** إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ فَأْتُوا۟ (if you are truthful, THEN produce)
❌ **Wrong:** إِن كُنتُمْ صَٰدِقِينَ ائْتُوا۟ (missing فَ before imperative)

**Don't assume all "if" sentences use إِنْ:** In the next lesson, you'll learn that إِذَا (idhā) "when" and لَوْ (law) "if only" are also used for conditionals, but they DON'T trigger jussive mood. Each particle has its own rules.
</Callout>

Create an appropriate result clause. Make sure the verb is in jussive mood. Consider adding فَ if needed.

</ExerciseBox>

## Summary

Conditional sentences in Arabic express if-then relationships through a three-part structure: conditional particle + condition clause + result clause. The particle إِنْ (in) "if" is the most common, and it triggers a visible grammatical change — both verbs must take jussive mood (majzūm).

The jussive mood is marked by:
- **Deletion of final nūn** (ن) for plural and dual verbs
- **Sukūn** (ـْ) on the final letter for singular verbs

Mastering conditionals requires recognizing these mood markers and distinguishing إِنْ (conditional "if") from إِنَّ (emphatic "indeed"). The result clause may need the linking particle فَ (fa) before it in certain cases.

This structural foundation prepares you for [L4.04 Types of Conditional Particles](/learn/level-4/04-conditional-particles/), where you'll learn how different particles (إِنْ, إِذَا, لَوْ) create different certainty levels and mood requirements.
