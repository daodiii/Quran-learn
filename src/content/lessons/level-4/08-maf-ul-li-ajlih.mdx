## Introduction

Why did you do it? Arabic has a specialized accusative construction to express the REASON or PURPOSE behind an action: the **maf'ul li-ajlih** (object of cause). This is a masdar placed in the accusative case to answer "for what purpose?" or "because of what?"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ"
  transliteration="yajʿalūna aṣābiʿahum fī ādhānihim mina ṣ-ṣawāʿiqi ḥadhara l-mawti"
  translation="They put their fingers in their ears from the thunderclaps, in fear of death"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:19"
  highlight="حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ"
/>

The word **حَذَرَ** (ḥadhara) "fear, caution" is the maf'ul li-ajlih. It answers WHY they put their fingers in their ears: "out of fear" or "because of caution." It expresses the MOTIVE for the action.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand maf'ul li-ajlih as the masdar expressing reason/purpose
- Recognize four conditions that must be met for this function
- Distinguish causal objects from absolute objects and direct objects
- Identify maf'ul li-ajlih in accusative case patterns
- Analyze causal expressions in Surah Al-Baqarah
- Apply morphological analysis to causal constructions

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.07 Maf'ul Mutlaq](/learn/level-4/07-maf-ul-mutlaq/), you learned how a masdar can EMPHASIZE the verb's action (same root). Now you'll see how a masdar can EXPLAIN WHY the action happened (different purpose, often different root). Both use accusative case, but for completely different grammatical functions.

**Forward connection:** This lesson continues the specialized accusative series. Next, in [L4.09 Maf'ul Ma'ah](/learn/level-4/09-maf-ul-ma-ah/), you'll learn about the object of accompaniment, which expresses WITH WHOM an action occurred. Together, these three lessons complete the major accusative functions beyond direct objects.

## Understanding the Object of Cause

**Plain English first:** Think of maf'ul li-ajlih as the "because-word." It's the masdar that answers "why?" or "for what reason?"

**Analogy for clarity:**

Imagine a courtroom:
- **The action (verb):** "He ran"
- **Direct object:** "He ran THE RACE" (what he ran)
- **Absolute object:** "He ran A RUNNING" (emphasizes how he ran)
- **Object of cause:** "He ran OUT OF FEAR" (why he ran)

The maf'ul li-ajlih provides the MOTIVE, the REASON, the CAUSE for doing the action.

### Arabic Terminology

**Maf'ul li-Ajlih** — [mafʿūl li-ajlihi](/resources/glossary/#mafool-li-ajlih) (mafʿūl li-ajlihi / مَفْعُولٌ لِأَجْلِهِ)

Literally "the object for the sake of which [the action was done]." The phrase **لِأَجْلِهِ** (li-ajlihi) means "for its sake, because of it."

**Alternative terms:**
- **مَفْعُولٌ لَهُ** (mafʿūl lahu) — "object for it"
- **مَفْعُولٌ مِنْ أَجْلِهِ** (mafʿūl min ajlihi) — "object from [because of] its sake"

All three terms refer to the same grammatical function: expressing the cause or purpose of an action.

**Grammatical status:**
- **Case:** Accusative (مَنْصُوبٌ) — typically with fatha or tanwin
- **Function:** Expresses reason, purpose, or motive
- **Form:** Usually a masdar (verbal noun)

## Four Conditions for Maf'ul li-Ajlih

Classical grammarians identified FOUR CONDITIONS that must be met for a masdar to function as maf'ul li-ajlih:

### Condition 1: Must Be a Masdar (Verbal Noun)

The maf'ul li-ajlih is almost always a masdar (verbal noun), not a concrete noun.

**Valid examples:**
- **خَوْفًا** (khawfan) — "out of fear" (masdar from خَافَ "to fear")
- **رَغْبَةً** (raghbatan) — "out of desire" (masdar from رَغِبَ "to desire")
- **حَذَرًا** (ḥadharan) — "out of caution" (masdar from حَذِرَ "to be cautious")

**Why masdar?** Because motives are ABSTRACT concepts (fear, hope, love), not concrete things. The masdar captures this abstractness perfectly.

### Condition 2: Must Share the Same Agent (فَاعِل)

The doer of the main verb must be the same as the doer of the maf'ul li-ajlih action.

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَامَ ٱلطَّالِبُ احْتِرَامًا لِلْمُعَلِّمِ"
  transliteration="qāma ṭ-ṭālibu iḥtirāman li-l-muʿallimi"
  translation="The student stood up out of respect for the teacher"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="احْتِرَامًا"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Main verb:** قَامَ (qāma) "stood up"
- **Agent:** ٱلطَّالِبُ (the student)
- **Maf'ul li-ajlih:** احْتِرَامًا (iḥtirāman) "respect"
- **Agent of اِحْتِرَام:** Also the student

The student both STOOD UP and FELT RESPECT — same agent for both actions. ✓ Valid maf'ul li-ajlih.

**Counter-example (invalid):**

"The student stood up because of the teacher's respect" — Here the respect belongs to the teacher, not the student. Different agents. ✗ Not valid maf'ul li-ajlih.

### Condition 3: Must Share the Same Time

The cause must occur at the SAME TIME as the main action, or slightly before.

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَدْرُسُ طَلَبًا لِلْعِلْمِ"
  transliteration="adrusu ṭalaban li-l-ʿilmi"
  translation="I study in seeking knowledge / out of desire for knowledge"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="طَلَبًا"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Main action:** أَدْرُسُ "I study" (present/continuous)
- **Cause:** طَلَبًا "seeking, desire" (present/continuous)
- **Time:** Both occur simultaneously — I study WHILE seeking knowledge ✓

**Counter-example:**

"I study because of yesterday's failure" — The failure happened in the past, the studying happens now. Different times might disqualify it from being maf'ul li-ajlih (though grammarians debate this edge case).

### Condition 4: Must Express a Heart Action (قَلْبِيَّة)

The maf'ul li-ajlih typically expresses a MENTAL or EMOTIONAL state — feelings, desires, intentions.

**Common heart actions (قَلْبِيَّة):**
- **خَوْفٌ** (khawf) — fear
- **رَجَاءٌ** (rajāʾ) — hope
- **حُبٌّ** (ḥubb) — love
- **كَرَاهِيَةٌ** (karāhiya) — hatred
- **رَغْبَةٌ** (raghba) — desire
- **احْتِرَامٌ** (iḥtirām) — respect

**Why heart actions?** Motives come from internal states — you act because you FEEL something (fear, hope, love). External physical causes typically use different constructions.

<Callout type="insight" title="Four conditions summary">
For a masdar to function as maf'ul li-ajlih, it must be:
1. **A masdar** (verbal noun, not concrete)
2. **Same agent** as the main verb
3. **Same time** as the main verb
4. **A heart action** (mental/emotional state)

If all four conditions are met, the masdar is placed in accusative case to express the REASON for the action.
</Callout>

## Maf'ul li-Ajlih vs. Other Accusatives

Let's distinguish the causal object from other accusative functions:

<GrammarTable>
| Type | Purpose | Example | Translation |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **Direct object** | What receives action | كَتَبَ رِسَالَةً (kataba risālatan) | "wrote a letter" |
| **Absolute object** | Emphasizes action (same root) | كَتَبَ كِتَابَةً (kataba kitābatan) | "wrote (emphatically)" |
| **Causal object** | Why action occurred | كَتَبَ رَغْبَةً (kataba raghbatan) | "wrote out of desire" |
</GrammarTable>

**Side-by-side comparison:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَتَبَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلدَّرْسَ كِتَابَةً جَمِيلَةً رَغْبَةً فِي ٱلتَّفَوُّقِ"
  transliteration="kataba ṭ-ṭālibu d-darsa kitābatan jamīlatan raghbatan fī t-tafawwuqi"
  translation="The student wrote the lesson beautifully out of desire for excellence"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="ٱلدَّرْسَ كِتَابَةً جَمِيلَةً رَغْبَةً"
/>

**Three accusatives in one sentence:**
1. **ٱلدَّرْسَ** (ad-darsa) — direct object (WHAT was written)
2. **كِتَابَةً جَمِيلَةً** (kitābatan jamīlatan) — absolute object with type (HOW it was written)
3. **رَغْبَةً** (raghbatan) — causal object (WHY it was written)

All three are accusative, but each serves a distinct grammatical function.

## Examples from Surah Al-Baqarah

Al-Baqarah contains rich examples of causal expressions:

### Example 1: Fear of Death

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَجْعَلُونَ أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ"
  transliteration="yajʿalūna aṣābiʿahum fī ādhānihim mina ṣ-ṣawāʿiqi ḥadhara l-mawti"
  translation="They put their fingers in their ears from the thunderclaps in fear of death"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:19"
  highlight="حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ"
/>

**Full grammatical analysis:**

**يَجْعَلُونَ** (yajʿalūna) — "they put/place"
- Verb: Present indicative, Form I from ج-ع-ل
- Subject: Embedded pronoun "they" (referring to hypocrites)

**أَصَٰبِعَهُمْ** (aṣābiʿahum) — "their fingers"
- Function: Direct object
- Case: Accusative (sound masculine plural ending ـِينَ → ـِ before possessive)
- Root: ص-ب-ع "finger"

**فِىٓ ءَاذَانِهِم** (fī ādhānihim) — "in their ears"
- Function: Prepositional phrase (location)
- Root: أ-ذ-ن "ear" (plural آذَانٌ)

**مِّنَ ٱلصَّوَٰعِقِ** (mina ṣ-ṣawāʿiqi) — "from the thunderclaps"
- Function: Prepositional phrase (source/cause)
- Root: ص-ع-ق "thunderbolt"

**حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ** (ḥadhara l-mawti) — "fear/caution of death"
- **Function:** Maf'ul li-ajlih (object of cause)
- **Case:** Accusative (fatha on حَذَرَ)
- **Root:** ح-ذ-ر "to be cautious, to fear"
- **Form:** Masdar (فَعَلٌ pattern)
- **Construction:** مُضَاف (ḥadhar) + مُضَاف إِلَيْهِ (al-mawt) = "fear of death"

**Why maf'ul li-ajlih?**
1. ✓ Masdar: حَذَرَ is a verbal noun
2. ✓ Same agent: "They" put fingers in ears AND "they" feel fear
3. ✓ Same time: Fear and finger-placing happen simultaneously
4. ✓ Heart action: Fear is an emotional/mental state

**Translation note:** The phrase answers WHY they put their fingers in their ears — "out of fear of death" or "because they fear death."

### Example 2: Desire for Worldly Gain

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ مَن يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="wa-mina n-nāsi man yashrī nafsahu btighāʾa marḍāti llāhi"
  translation="And among people is he who sells himself seeking Allah's pleasure"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:207"
  highlight="ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ"
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

**يَشْرِى نَفْسَهُ** (yashrī nafsahu) — "sells himself"
- Verb: Present, Form I from ش-ر-ي "to buy/sell"
- Direct object: نَفْسَهُ "himself/his soul"

**ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ** (ibtighāʾa marḍāti llāhi) — "seeking Allah's pleasure"
- **Function:** Maf'ul li-ajlih (object of cause)
- **Case:** Accusative (fatha with hamza)
- **Root:** ب-غ-ي "to seek"
- **Form:** Form VIII masdar (اِفْتِعَالٌ pattern: ابْتِغَاء)
- **Construction:** Idafa chain: اِبْتِغَاء (seeking) + مَرْضَاتِ (pleasure) + ٱللَّهِ (Allah)

**Why maf'ul li-ajlih?**
1. ✓ Masdar: ابْتِغَاء is Form VIII verbal noun
2. ✓ Same agent: The person both sells AND seeks
3. ✓ Same time: Selling and seeking happen together
4. ✓ Heart action: Seeking is a mental intention/desire

**Meaning:** This answers WHY the believer sacrifices himself — "out of seeking" or "in order to seek" Allah's pleasure.

### Example 3: Hope for Reward

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلَّذِينَ يُنفِقُونَ أَمْوَٰلَهُمُ ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا مِّنْ أَنفُسِهِمْ"
  transliteration="wa-lladhīna yunfiqūna amwālahumu btighāʾa marḍāti llāhi wa-tathbītan min anfusihim"
  translation="And those who spend their wealth seeking Allah's pleasure and as a strengthening from themselves"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:265"
  highlight="ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ وَتَثْبِيتًا"
/>

**Two maf'ul li-ajlih in parallel:**

1. **ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ** (ibtighāʾa marḍāti llāhi) — "seeking Allah's pleasure"
2. **تَثْبِيتًا** (tathbītan) — "as strengthening/affirmation"

Both are accusative masdars expressing WHY they spend — first, seeking divine pleasure; second, strengthening their own faith.

**Form II masdar:** تَثْبِيتٌ (tathbīt) is the Form II masdar from ث-ب-ت "to be firm/steady." The Form II (ثَبَّتَ) means "to make firm, to strengthen."

## Alternative Constructions

The maf'ul li-ajlih can appear in THREE forms:

### Form 1: Accusative with Tanwin (Most Common)

**Pattern:** Bare masdar with tanwin

<ArabicExample
  arabic="جِئْتُ طَلَبًا لِلْعِلْمِ"
  transliteration="jiʾtu ṭalaban li-l-ʿilmi"
  translation="I came seeking knowledge"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="طَلَبًا"
/>

**طَلَبًا** (ṭalaban) — accusative with tanwin, the classic maf'ul li-ajlih form.

### Form 2: Accusative in Idafa (Construct State)

**Pattern:** Masdar + genitive noun

<ArabicExample
  arabic="جِئْتُ طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمِ"
  transliteration="jiʾtu ṭalaba l-ʿilmi"
  translation="I came seeking knowledge"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمِ"
/>

**طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمِ** (ṭalaba l-ʿilmi) — accusative in construct state (no tanwin because it's mudaf).

### Form 3: Genitive After لِـ (Preposition)

**Pattern:** لِـ + masdar

<ArabicExample
  arabic="جِئْتُ لِطَلَبِ ٱلْعِلْمِ"
  transliteration="jiʾtu li-ṭalabi l-ʿilmi"
  translation="I came for seeking knowledge"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="لِطَلَبِ"
/>

**لِطَلَبِ** (li-ṭalabi) — genitive after the preposition لِـ "for."

**All three are grammatically valid** and mean essentially the same thing. The accusative forms (1 and 2) are considered "true" maf'ul li-ajlih by grammarians. The prepositional form (3) expresses the same semantic idea but technically is a prepositional phrase, not an accusative object.

## Summary

**Maf'ul li-ajlih (object of cause) key points:**

1. **Definition:** A masdar placed in accusative case to express the REASON, PURPOSE, or MOTIVE for an action
2. **Four conditions:**
   - Must be a **masdar** (verbal noun)
   - Must have the **same agent** as the main verb
   - Must occur at the **same time** as the main verb
   - Must express a **heart action** (mental/emotional state)
3. **Case:** Accusative (مَنْصُوبٌ) with fatha or tanwin
4. **Function:** Answers "why?" or "for what purpose?"
5. **Common masdars:** خَوْفٌ (fear), رَجَاءٌ (hope), حُبٌّ (love), رَغْبَةٌ (desire), احْتِرَامٌ (respect), ابْتِغَاءٌ (seeking)
6. **Alternative forms:**
   - Accusative with tanwin (طَلَبًا)
   - Accusative in idafa (طَلَبَ ٱلْعِلْمِ)
   - Genitive after لِـ (لِطَلَبِ ٱلْعِلْمِ)

**Distinction from other accusatives:**

| Type | Root vs. Verb | Purpose | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Direct object** | Different | Receives action | كَتَبَ رِسَالَةً |
| **Absolute object** | Same (masdar of verb) | Emphasizes action | كَتَبَ كِتَابَةً |
| **Causal object** | Usually different | Explains why | كَتَبَ رَغْبَةً |

**Recognition checklist:**
1. Find an accusative masdar
2. Ask: Does it answer "why?" or "for what reason?"
3. Check four conditions (masdar, same agent, same time, heart action)
4. If all met → maf'ul li-ajlih

**Six examples from this lesson:**

| Example | Root | Maf'ul li-Ajlih | Meaning | Reference |
|---------|------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| They put fingers in ears | ح-ذ-ر | حَذَرَ ٱلْمَوْتِ | out of fear of death | Al-Baqarah 2:19 |
| He sells himself | ب-غ-ي | ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ | seeking Allah's pleasure | Al-Baqarah 2:207 |
| They spend wealth | ب-غ-ي | ٱبْتِغَآءَ مَرْضَاتِ ٱللَّهِ | seeking Allah's pleasure | Al-Baqarah 2:265 |
| They spend wealth | ث-ب-ت | تَثْبِيتًا | for strengthening | Al-Baqarah 2:265 |
| Student stood | ح-ت-ر-م | احْتِرَامًا | out of respect | (example) |
| I study | ط-ل-ب | طَلَبًا | seeking | (example) |

**Next steps:** In [L4.09 Maf'ul Ma'ah](/learn/level-4/09-maf-ul-ma-ah/), you'll learn about the object of accompaniment — an accusative construction expressing WITH WHOM or ALONG WITH WHAT an action occurred. This completes the trio of specialized accusative functions: emphasis (mutlaq), cause (li-ajlih), and accompaniment (ma'ah).
