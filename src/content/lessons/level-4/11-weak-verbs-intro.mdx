## Introduction

You've mastered sound verbs — verbs with three strong consonants that conjugate regularly. Now you're ready for the most challenging topic in Arabic verb morphology: weak verbs. These are verbs containing a weak letter (waw و, ya ي, or alif ا/hamza ء) that causes irregularities in conjugation.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ"
  transliteration="ihdinā ṣ-ṣirāṭa l-mustaqīma"
  translation="Guide us to the straight path"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:6"
  highlight="ٱهْدِنَا"
/>

The word **ٱهْدِنَا** (ihdinā) "guide us" is an imperative verb from the root ه-د-ي (h-d-y). Notice that the final root letter is ي (ya) — a weak letter. This makes it a [defective verb](/resources/glossary#fil-naqis) (fiʿl nāqiṣ / فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ), and it conjugates differently from sound verbs. Instead of adding suffixes directly, the weak letter undergoes changes.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand what makes a verb "weak" vs "sound"
- Master the four-category classification: hollow, defective, assimilated, hamzated
- Learn the systematic 4-step recognition strategy for weak verbs
- Apply categorization skills to Quranic examples from Al-Fatiha
- Recognize weak verbs as patterns to learn, not exceptions to memorize

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/02-verb-form-i), you learned the three vowel classes (faʿala, faʿila, faʿula) for sound verbs. In [L3.03 Past Tense](/learn/level-3/03-past-tense) and [L3.04 Present Tense](/learn/level-3/04-present-tense), you mastered sound verb conjugation. Now you'll discover that weak verbs follow DIFFERENT but SYSTEMATIC patterns based on which position contains the weak letter.

**Forward connection:** This lesson establishes the framework. The next four lessons apply it systematically: [L4.12 Hollow Verbs](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs) (middle weak), [L4.13 Defective Verbs](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs) (final weak), [L4.14 Assimilated Verbs](/learn/level-4/14-assimilated-verbs) (initial weak), and [L4.15 Hamzated Verbs](/learn/level-4/15-hamzated-verbs) (hamza complications).

**Key mindset shift:** Weak verbs are NOT exceptions to memorize individually. They are CATEGORIES with consistent internal patterns. Learn the category rules, and you can handle hundreds of weak verbs systematically.

## Understanding Weak vs Sound Verbs

**Plain English first:** Imagine you're building a tower. With strong bricks (sound verbs), you stack them predictably — each level is stable and follows the same rules. But if one brick is made of soft clay (weak letter), that level behaves differently — it might compress, change shape, or even disappear under pressure. Weak verbs work the same way: when conjugation rules "put pressure" on a weak letter (adding suffixes, changing vowels), that weak letter changes or drops.

### What Makes a Letter "Weak"?

In Arabic, three letters are called [weak letters](/resources/glossary#hurufu-l-illah) (ḥurūfu l-ʿillah / حُرُوفُ ٱلْعِلَّةِ):

1. **و (waw)** — pronounced like "w" or long "u"
2. **ي (ya)** — pronounced like "y" or long "i"
3. **ا (alif)** — represents long "a" (has no consonantal value)

Additionally, **ء (hamza)** causes irregularities and is sometimes grouped with weak letters for conjugation purposes.

**Why are they "weak"?** These letters are semi-vowels — they sit between consonants and vowels. When conjugation rules try to add vowels or suffixes, these letters often:
- Contract into long vowels
- Drop entirely
- Transform into other letters
- Merge with surrounding vowels

### Sound Verb vs Weak Verb: The Difference

**[Sound verb](/resources/glossary#fil-sahih)** (fiʿl ṣaḥīḥ / فِعْلٌ صَحِيحٌ) — all three root letters are strong consonants

Example: **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b) "writing"
- Past: كَتَبَ (kataba) "he wrote"
- Present: يَكْتُبُ (yaktubu) "he writes"
- Imperative: ٱُكْتُبْ (uktub) "write!"

All conjugations follow predictable rules. No letters drop or change.

**[Weak verb](/resources/glossary#fil-mutall)** (fiʿl muʿtall / فِعْلٌ مُعْتَلٌّ) — contains at least one weak letter (و، ي، ا) or hamza (ء)

Example: **ق-و-ل** (q-w-l) "saying"
- Past: قَالَْ (qāla) "he said" — middle و contracted to long ا
- Present: يَقُولُ (yaqūlu) "he says" — middle و becomes long ū
- Imperative: قُلْ (qul) "say!" — middle و dropped entirely!

The weak letter و changes form or disappears depending on conjugation context.

## The Four-Category Classification System

**Key insight:** Weak verbs are NOT one random group. They divide into FOUR clear categories based on WHERE the weak letter appears in the root:

<GrammarTable>
| Category | Arabic Term | Position | Weak Letter | Example Root | Example Word | Pattern Behavior |
|----------|-------------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Hollow** | أَجْوَف | Middle (2nd radical) | و or ي | ق-و-ل | قَالَْ (qāla) "said" | Middle letter contracts/drops |
| **Defective** | نَاقِصٌ | Final (3rd radical) | و or ي | ه-د-ي | هَدَىْٰ (hadā) "guided" | Final letter changes/drops |
| **Assimilated** | مِثَالٌ | Initial (1st radical) | و (rarely ي) | و-ج-د | وَجَدَ (wajada) "found" | Initial و drops in some forms |
| **Hamzated** | مَهْمُوزٌ | Any position | ء (hamza) | ق-ر-ء | قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) "read" | Hamza seat changes based on vowels |
</GrammarTable>

**Memory aid:** Think of the root as a three-position slot machine: [1st]–[2nd]–[3rd]. The weak letter's position determines which category and which rules apply.

### Category 1: Hollow Verbs (al-Ajwaf)

**[Hollow verb](/resources/glossary#fil-ajwaf)** (fiʿl ajwaf / فِعْلٌ أَجْوَفٌ) — weak letter in the MIDDLE position

**Arabic term etymology:** أَجْوَف (ajwaf) means "hollow" or "empty" — the middle is hollowed out or contracted.

**Most common weak verb type** — appears frequently in the Quran

Examples:
- ق-و-ل (q-w-l) → قَالَْ (qāla) "he said"
- ك-و-ن (k-w-n) → كَانَْ (kāna) "he was"
- ج-ي-ء (j-y-ʾ) → جَاءَْ (jāʾa) "he came"

**Pattern rule:** The middle weak letter contracts into a long vowel (ا، و، ي) in most conjugations, or drops entirely in imperative and jussive forms.

Detailed study in [L4.12 Hollow Verbs](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs).

### Category 2: Defective Verbs (al-Naqis)

**[Defective verb](/resources/glossary#fil-naqis)** (fiʿl nāqiṣ / فِعْلٌ نَاقِصٌ) — weak letter in the FINAL position

**Arabic term etymology:** نَاقِصٌ (nāqiṣ) means "deficient" or "lacking" — the verb lacks a full strong final letter.

**Second most common** — many high-frequency verbs are defective

Examples:
- ه-د-ي (h-d-y) → هَدَىْٰ (hadā) "he guided"
- م-ش-ي (m-sh-y) → مَشَىْٰ (mashā) "he walked"
- د-ع-و (d-ʿ-w) → دَعَاْ (daʿā) "he called"

**Pattern rule:** The final weak letter changes form depending on case endings and conjugation. It often appears as ى (alif maqṣūrah) in past tense, and drops before pronoun suffixes.

Detailed study in [L4.13 Defective Verbs](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs).

### Category 3: Assimilated Verbs (al-Mithal)

**[Assimilated verb](/resources/glossary#fil-mithal)** (fiʿl mithāl / فِعْلٌ مِثَالٌ) — weak letter in the INITIAL position

**Arabic term etymology:** مِثَالٌ (mithāl) means "similar" or "example" — these verbs resemble sound verbs except in certain forms.

**Least irregular** — often conjugates like sound verbs, with exceptions in imperative and derived forms

Examples:
- و-ج-د (w-j-d) → وَجَدَ (wajada) "he found"
- و-ص-ل (w-ṣ-l) → وَصَلَ (waṣala) "he arrived"
- و-ق-ع (w-q-ʿ) → وَقَعَ (waqaʿa) "he fell"

**Pattern rule:** The initial و drops in the imperative (جِدْ "find!" not *وِجِدْ) and present tense of Form I (يَجِدُ not *يَوْجِدُ). Otherwise fairly regular.

Detailed study in [L4.14 Assimilated Verbs](/learn/level-4/14-assimilated-verbs).

### Category 4: Hamzated Verbs (al-Mahmuz)

**[Hamzated verb](/resources/glossary#fil-mahmuz)** (fiʿl mahmūz / فِعْلٌ مَهْمُوزٌ) — contains hamza ء in any position

**Arabic term etymology:** مَهْمُوزٌ (mahmūz) means "having hamza."

**Different type of irregularity** — hamza changes its "seat" (throne) depending on surrounding vowels

Examples:
- ء-م-ن (ʾ-m-n) → آمَنَْ (āmana) "he believed" (initial hamza)
- س-ء-ل (s-ʾ-l) → سَأَلَ (saʾala) "he asked" (middle hamza)
- ق-ر-ء (q-r-ʾ) → قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) "he read" (final hamza)

**Pattern rule:** Hamza sits on different "thrones" (ا، و، ي، or standalone ء) based on vowel hierarchy. The conjugation is otherwise regular — only the spelling changes.

Detailed study in [L4.15 Hamzated Verbs](/learn/level-4/15-hamzated-verbs).

## The 4-Step Recognition Strategy

**This is the most important section.** Don't memorize individual weak verbs. Instead, master this systematic approach:

<Callout type="rule" title="4-Step Weak Verb Recognition Strategy">

**Step 1: Find the root**
Strip away prefixes, suffixes, case endings, and definite article to isolate the three (or four) root consonants.

**Step 2: Identify any weak letters**
Check if the root contains و، ي، ا، or ء. If all letters are strong consonants, it's a sound verb — stop here.

**Step 3: Determine the position**
Is the weak letter in position 1 (assimilated), position 2 (hollow), or position 3 (defective)? Is it hamza (hamzated)?

**Step 4: Apply category rules**
Use the appropriate category rules for conjugation patterns. Each category has systematic principles — not random exceptions.

</Callout>

### Step-by-Step Example: Analyzing ٱهْدِنَا

Let's apply the 4-step strategy to the word from Al-Fatiha:

**Word:** ٱهْدِنَا (ihdinā) "guide us"

**Step 1: Find the root**
- Strip prefix: ٱِ (imperative hamza) → leaves هْدِنَا
- Strip suffix: ـنَا (us) → leaves هْدِ
- Add the missing third radical → root is **ه-د-ي** (h-d-y)

How did we know the third radical is ي? Because in Arabic dictionaries, defective verbs show the full trilateral root even when the final letter drops in conjugation.

**Step 2: Identify weak letters**
Root **ه-د-ي** contains ي (ya) — a weak letter.

**Step 3: Determine position**
The ي appears in the 3rd (final) position → **defective verb** category

**Step 4: Apply category rules**
Defective verb rules tell us:
- In imperative, the final ي drops before pronoun suffixes
- The base imperative is ٱِهْدِ (ihdi) "guide!" with the ي visible
- When we add ـنَا (us), the ي drops: ٱِهْدِ + نَا → ٱِهْدِنَا

Result: We systematically determined the verb type and understood why it conjugates this way — no memorization required!

### Practice with Al-Fatiha Verbs

Let's apply the 4-step strategy to other verbs from Al-Fatiha:

**Example 2: نَعْبُدُ (naʿbudu) "we worship"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ"
  transliteration="iyyāka naʿbudu wa-iyyāka nastaʿīnu"
  translation="You alone we worship, and You alone we ask for help"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:5"
  highlight="نَعْبُدُ"
/>

**Step 1:** Root is **ع-ب-د** (ʿ-b-d)
**Step 2:** No weak letters (ع، ب، د are all strong consonants)
**Step 3:** N/A — this is a **sound verb**
**Step 4:** Apply regular sound verb conjugation rules

**Example 3: نَسْتَعِينُ (nastaʿīnu) "we ask for help"**

**Step 1:** Root is **ع-و-ن** (ʿ-w-n) — derived Form X (اِسْتَفْعَلَ)
**Step 2:** Contains و (waw) — weak letter
**Step 3:** The و is in position 2 (middle) → **hollow verb** category
**Step 4:** Hollow verb rules apply — the و became long ī in present tense

Notice how the و transformed into ي in this conjugation. This is a hollow verb pattern!

## Weak Verb Recognition in Context

Now let's practice categorizing weak verbs from various Quranic contexts:

<GrammarTable>
| Quranic Word | Transliteration | Root | Weak Letter | Position | Category | Translation |
|--------------|-----------------|------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|
| قَالَْ | qāla | ق-و-ل | و | 2nd | Hollow | he said |
| جَاءَْ | jāʾa | ج-ي-ء | ي | 2nd | Hollow | he came |
| هَدَىْٰ | hadā | ه-د-ي | ي | 3rd | Defective | he guided |
| دَعَاْ | daʿā | د-ع-و | و | 3rd | Defective | he called |
| وَجَدَ | wajada | و-ج-د | و | 1st | Assimilated | he found |
| قَرَأَ | qaraʾa | ق-ر-ء | ء | 3rd | Hamzated | he read |
| آمَنَْ | āmana | ء-م-ن | ء | 1st | Hamzated | he believed |
| سَأَلَ | saʾala | س-ء-ل | ء | 2nd | Hamzated | he asked |
</GrammarTable>

**Key observation:** Once you identify the weak letter's position, you know which category and which rules to apply. The patterns are systematic, not random.

<Callout type="info" title="Doubly Weak Verbs">

Some verbs have TWO weak letters in the same root. These are called [doubly weak verbs](/resources/glossary#fil-lafif) (fiʿl lafīf / فِعْلٌ لَفِيفٌ):

- **و-ق-ي** (w-q-y) "to protect" — assimilated + defective
- **ر-ء-ي** (r-ʾ-y) "to see" — hamzated + defective

These combine the rules of both categories. They're less common, so we'll address them after mastering the four main categories.

</Callout>

## Why This Framework Matters

**Traditional approach (DON'T do this):** Memorize each weak verb's conjugation as an individual exception. This requires memorizing hundreds of irregular patterns.

**GSD approach (DO this):** Learn the FOUR category rules. Then apply them systematically to any weak verb you encounter. This requires understanding four rule sets — exponentially easier!

**Practical benefit for Quran study:**

When you encounter **فَقَالَْ** (fa-qāla) "and he said" in your reading:
1. Recognize root ق-و-ل with middle و → hollow verb
2. Apply hollow verb rules → middle و contracts to ا in past tense
3. Understand the morphology instantly — no dictionary needed!

This skill accelerates your reading fluency and deepens comprehension.

<ExerciseBox
  title="Exercise 4: Al-Fatiha Weak Verb Hunt"
  instructions="Read Al-Fatiha (Chapter 1) and identify ALL weak verbs. State the root, weak letter position, and category for each."
>

**Hint:** Al-Fatiha contains at least 3 weak verbs. Look carefully at:
- Verse 5: إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ
- Verse 6: ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ
- Verse 7: صِرَاطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ

**Challenge:** Identify the verb forms (Form I, IV, X, etc.) as well as the categories.

**Expected verbs:**
1. **نَعْبُدُ** (naʿbudu) — root ع-ب-د, no weak letter → SOUND verb (trick question!)
2. **نَسْتَعِينُ** (nastaʿīnu) — root ع-و-ن, و in position 2 → Hollow, Form X
3. **ٱهْدِنَا** (ihdinā) — root ه-د-ي, ي in position 3 → Defective, Form I imperative
4. **أَنْعَمْتَ** (anʿamta) — root ن-ع-م, no weak letter → SOUND verb, Form IV

Note: This exercise reinforces that not all verbs are weak — always check first!

</ExerciseBox>

## Summary

You've now mastered the foundational framework for weak verbs:

**Key concepts:**
1. **Weak letters:** و، ي، ا، ء cause conjugation irregularities
2. **Four categories:** Position determines category (hollow, defective, assimilated, hamzated)
3. **Recognition strategy:** 4 systematic steps replace memorization
4. **Pattern-based learning:** Each category follows consistent internal rules
