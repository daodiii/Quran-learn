## Introduction

Welcome to Level 4! You've mastered Arabic sentence structure and word morphology. Now you're ready to explore specialized grammatical functions that add precision and nuance to Quranic expression.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَآءً يَبْكُونَ"
  transliteration="wa jāʾū abāhum ʿishāʾan yabkūna"
  translation="And they came to their father at night, weeping"
  reference="Yusuf 12:16"
  highlight="يَبْكُونَ"
/>

In this verse, the brothers of Yusuf came to their father — but HOW did they come? The word **يَبْكُونَ** (yabkūna) "weeping" describes the STATE or CONDITION in which they arrived. This is a [hal clause](/resources/glossary/#hal) (ḥāl / ḥāl) — a circumstantial expression that tells us the manner or state accompanying an action.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand hal as describing the state or circumstance in which an action occurs
- Recognize the three types of hal expressions (single word, sentence, semi-sentence)
- Master the accusative case marking required for hal
- Distinguish hal from adjectives (na't) using definiteness and function tests

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L2.05 Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/05-accusative-case/), you learned that the accusative (naṣb / نَصْبٌ) marks direct objects. Now discover a specialized accusative function: hal — describing the TEMPORARY STATE accompanying an action. While direct objects receive the action, hal describes the CIRCUMSTANCES of the action.

**Key Level 4 advancement:** Level 3 taught you word morphology — how roots become verbs, nouns, and participles. Level 4 teaches you specialized grammatical functions — how words serve precise roles beyond basic subject/predicate/object. Hal is your first specialized function that adds descriptive depth to Quranic narrative.

## Understanding Hal (Circumstantial Expressions)

**Plain English first:** A hal clause answers the question "HOW?" or "IN WHAT STATE?" someone did something. It's like adding a descriptive snapshot to an action.

Consider these English examples:
- "She entered the room **smiling**" ← smiling describes HOW she entered
- "He left **angry**" ← angry describes the STATE he was in when he left
- "They arrived **exhausted**" ← exhausted describes their CONDITION upon arrival

Arabic hal works the same way, but with specific grammatical rules. The hal must be:
1. **Indefinite** (no ٱلْـ prefix)
2. **Accusative case** (takes fatḥah or fatḥatain ending)
3. **Temporary state** (not permanent characteristic)

### Arabic Terminology

**Hal** — [ḥāl](/resources/glossary/#hal) (*ḥāl*) literally means "state" or "condition"

The hal describes the temporary state or circumstance of the subject (or object) when performing (or receiving) the action. It's always related to a noun in the sentence, called the [ṣāḥib al-ḥāl](/resources/glossary/#sahib-al-hal) (ṣāḥib al-ḥāl / صَاحِبُ ٱلْحَالِ) — "the owner of the state."

**Example structure:**
- ****jāʾa** مُحَمَّدٌ **ḍāḥikan**** (jāʾa muḥammadun ḍāḥikan) — "Muhammad came laughing"
  - **jāʾa** = the action (came)
  - مُحَمَّدٌ = the actor/subject (ṣāḥib al-ḥāl)
  - **ḍāḥikan** = the hal (laughing) — describes Muhammad's state WHILE coming

### The Three Types of Hal

Arabic hal expressions come in three forms, each with distinct grammatical structure:

#### 1. Single-Word Hal (Al-Ḥāl Al-Mufrad)

The hal is a single word (noun or adjective) in the accusative case.

**Pattern:** [Action] + [Actor] + [Hal in accusative]

**Examples:**
- **دَخَلَ ٱلطَّالِبُ مُسْرِعًا** (dakhala ṭ-ṭālibu musriʿan) — "The student entered hurrying"
  - مُسْرِعًا (hurrying) — single accusative word describing the student's state

- **رَجَعَ **khāʾifan**** (rajaʿa khāʾifan) — "He returned fearful"
  - **khāʾifan** (fearful) — single accusative word

#### 2. Sentence Hal (Al-Ḥāl Al-Jumlah)

The hal is a complete sentence (nominal or verbal) that describes the state. Sentence hal often begins with **وَ** (wāw al-ḥāl / *wāwu* ٱلْحَالِ) — "the waw of circumstance" — or contains a pronoun referring back to the ṣāḥib al-ḥāl.

**Pattern:** [Action] + [Actor] + **وَ** + [Sentence describing state]

**Examples:**
- ****jāʾa** مُحَمَّدٌ وَهُوَ يَضْحَكُ** (jāʾa muḥammadun wa-huwa yaḍḥaku) — "Muhammad came while he was laughing"
  - وَهُوَ يَضْحَكُ = sentence hal (nominal sentence: "he is laughing")
  - The pronoun هُوَ refers back to Muhammad

- **خَرَجَ ٱلْقَوْمُ وَهُمْ يَبْكُونَ** (kharaja l-qawmu wa-hum yabkūna) — "The people went out while they were weeping"
  - وَهُمْ يَبْكُونَ = sentence hal with plural pronoun

**Key recognition:** The wāw at the beginning is NOT "and" — it's the wāw al-ḥāl marking a circumstantial clause.

#### 3. Semi-Sentence Hal (Al-Ḥāl Shibh Al-Jumlah)

The hal is a prepositional phrase or locational expression (ẓarf / ظَرْفٌ).

**Pattern:** [Action] + [Actor] + [Prepositional phrase describing location/state]

**Examples:**
- **جَلَسَ ٱلطَّالِبُ فِي ٱلْفَصْلِ** (jalasa ṭ-ṭālibu fī l-faṣli) — "The student sat in the classroom"
  - فِي ٱلْفَصْلِ = prepositional phrase describing circumstance

- **رَأَيْتُهُۥ عِنْدَ ٱلْبَابِ** (raʾaytuhu ʿinda l-bābi) — "I saw him at the door"
  - عِنْدَ ٱلْبَابِ = locational phrase describing where he was

### Hal Must Be Indefinite and Accusative

**Rule 1: Hal must be indefinite (nakirah / نَكِرَةٌ)**

If the hal is a single word, it CANNOT have the definite article ٱلْـ or be in a possessive construction (iḍāfah).

❌ Wrong: ****jāʾa** ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلضَّاحِكَ** (definite)
✓ Correct: ****jāʾa** ٱلطَّالِبُ **ḍāḥikan**** (indefinite)

**Why?** Hal describes a TEMPORARY STATE, not a permanent characteristic. Definiteness implies permanence or specific identity, while indefiniteness captures the fleeting nature of circumstance.

**Rule 2: Hal must be accusative (manṣūb / مَنْصُوبٌ)**

Single-word hal takes fatḥah (ـَ) or fatḥatain (ـً) ending.

**Example:**
- **ضَاحِكٌ** (ḍāḥikun) nominative → ****ḍāḥikan**** (ḍāḥikan) accusative hal

**For sentence and semi-sentence hal:** The hal itself doesn't take a case ending (sentences don't decline), but they function in the accusative position grammatically.

### Hal vs Na't (Adjective) — Critical Distinction

Learners often confuse hal with na't (adjective / نَعْتٌ) because both can describe nouns. The distinction is crucial:

<GrammarTable>
| Feature | Hal (*ḥāl*) | Na't (*naʿt*) |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| **Function** | Describes TEMPORARY STATE during action | Describes PERMANENT characteristic |
| **Definiteness** | Always INDEFINITE | Matches the noun it modifies |
| **Case** | Always ACCUSATIVE | Matches the noun it modifies |
| **Agreement** | Only in gender/number (not definiteness/case) with ṣāḥib al-ḥāl | Full agreement (gender/number/case/definiteness) |
| **Example** | **jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ **ḍāḥikan**<br/>"The man came laughing" | **jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ<br/>"The generous man came" |
| **Translation test** | Can add "while" or "in a state of" | Translates as direct adjective |
| **Definiteness test** | Making it definite breaks the meaning | Making it indefinite changes identity |
</GrammarTable>

**The quick test:** Can you make the descriptive word DEFINITE without changing the core meaning?

- ****jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ **ḍāḥikan**** (the man came laughing)
  - Try making **ḍāḥikan** definite: **jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلضَّاحِكُ
  - Meaning CHANGES: now it's "the laughing man came" (identifying which man)
  - Conclusion: ****ḍāḥikan** is HAL** (temporary state)

- ****jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ** (the generous man came)
  - Already definite — it's identifying which man (the generous one)
  - Conclusion: **ٱلْكَرِيمُ is NA'T** (permanent characteristic)

**Another test — "while":** Can you naturally insert "while" or "in a state of" in the translation?

- ****jāʾa** **ḍāḥikan**** → "He came WHILE laughing" ✓ (hal)
- ****jāʾa** ٱلْكَرِيمُ** → "He came WHILE generous" ✗ (doesn't make sense — na't)

## Examples from the Quran (Surah Yusuf)

Surah Yusuf contains numerous hal clauses that bring the narrative to life. Let's examine how hal describes the states of characters during key moments.

### Example 1: The Brothers Weeping (Single-Word Hal)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَآءً يَبْكُونَ"
  transliteration="wa jāʾū abāhum ʿishāʾan yabkūna"
  translation="And they came to their father at night, weeping"
  reference="Yusuf 12:16"
  highlight="يَبْكُونَ"
/>

**Word focus: يَبْكُونَ** (yabkūna) — "weeping"

**Grammatical analysis:**
- **Function:** Hal (circumstantial expression)
- **Type:** Single-word hal (active participle used as hal)
- **Case marker:** Accusative with ـُونَ ending (masculine plural nominative FORM, but in accusative FUNCTION here due to hal position)
- **Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The pronoun وَ (they) in **jāʾū** refers to Yusuf's brothers
- **Root:** ب-ك-ي (b-k-y) "weeping"
- **Pattern:** يَفْعُلُونَ (yafʿulūna) — present tense, third person plural

**Narrative power:** The hal يَبْكُونَ captures the brothers' STATE when they came to Ya'qub — they were weeping (falsely, as the story reveals). This single word paints the scene: their arrival at night, their tears, their deception.

**Note on case:** Present tense verbs used as hal may appear to keep their indicative mood endings, but they function in the accusative hal position syntactically.

### Example 2: Yusuf Found in the Well (Sentence Hal)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَاءَتْ سَيَّارَةٌ فَأَرْسَلُوا۟ وَارِدَهُمْ فَأَدْلَىٰ دَلْوَهُۥ ۖ قَالَ يَٰبُشْرَىٰ هَٰذَا غُلَٰمٌ"
  transliteration="wa jāʾat sayyāratun fa-arsalū wāridahum fa-adlā dalwahu qāla yā bushrā hādhā ghulāmun"
  translation="And there came a caravan, and they sent their water-drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, 'Good news! This is a boy.'"
  reference="Yusuf 12:19"
  highlight="**qāla** يَٰبُشْرَىٰ"
/>

**Word focus: **qāla** يَٰبُشْرَىٰ** (qāla yā bushrā) — "he said, 'Good news!'"

**Grammatical analysis:**
- **Function:** Sentence hal (verbal sentence describing the state/reaction)
- **Type:** Verbal sentence (**qāla** + speech)
- **Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The water-drawer (وَارِدَهُمْ) who found Yusuf
- **Connection:** The verbal sentence describes his STATE OF REACTION when he pulled up the bucket

**Narrative power:** The sentence hal captures his immediate joyful exclamation upon discovering Yusuf — not just that he spoke, but that he spoke WHILE in a state of excitement and surprise.

### Example 3: Yusuf's Brothers Returning (Sentence Hal with Wāw)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَلَمَّا رَجَعُوٓا۟ إِلَىٰٓ أَبِيهِمْ قَالُوا يَٰٓأَبَانَا مُنِعَ مِنَّا ٱلْكَيْلُ"
  transliteration="fa-lammā rajaʿū ilā abīhim qālū yā abānā muniʿa minnā l-kaylu"
  translation="So when they returned to their father, they said, 'O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us'"
  reference="Yusuf 12:63"
  highlight="**qālū**"
/>

**Word focus: **qālū**** (qālū) — "they said"

**Grammatical analysis:**
- **Function:** Sentence hal (verbal sentence)
- **Type:** Verbal sentence describing their state upon return
- **Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The brothers (implied in رَجَعُوٓا۟)
- **Meaning:** They returned WHILE speaking/saying (their state of complaint)

**Pattern note:** Not all sentence hal have explicit wāw al-ḥāl. Context indicates the circumstantial relationship.

### Example 4: The King's Messengers (Semi-Sentence Hal)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَقَالَ ٱلْمَلِكُ ٱئْتُونِى بِهِۦ ۖ فَلَمَّا جَاءَهُ ٱلرَّسُولُ قَالَ ٱرْجِعْ إِلَىٰ رَبِّكَ"
  transliteration="wa qāla l-maliku 'tūnī bihi fa-lammā jāʾahu r-rasūlu qāla rjiʿ ilā rabbika"
  translation="And the king said, 'Bring him to me.' But when the messenger came to him, [Yusuf] said, 'Return to your master'"
  reference="Yusuf 12:50"
  highlight="*ilā* رَبِّكَ"
/>

**Word focus: *ilā* رَبِّكَ** (ilā rabbika) — "to your master"

**Grammatical analysis:**
- **Function:** Semi-sentence hal (prepositional phrase)
- **Type:** Direction phrase describing the messenger's destination state
- **Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The messenger (ٱلرَّسُولُ)
- **Meaning:** Return (while going) TO your master

**Note:** Some prepositional phrases function as hal by describing the circumstantial state related to the action.

### Example 5: Yusuf's Brothers' False Tears (Complex Hal)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَالُوا يَٰٓأَبَانَآ إِنَّا ذَهَبْنَا نَسْتَبِقُ وَتَرَكْنَا يُوسُفَ عِندَ مَتَٰعِنَا فَأَكَلَهُ ٱلذِّئْبُ"
  transliteration="qālū yā abānā innā dhahabnā nastabiqu wa-taraknā yūsufa ʿinda matāʿinā fa-akalahu dh-dhiʾbu"
  translation="They said, 'O our father, indeed we went racing and left Yusuf with our possessions, and a wolf ate him'"
  reference="Yusuf 12:17"
  highlight="نَسْتَبِقُ"
/>

**Word focus: نَسْتَبِقُ** (nastabiqu) — "racing"

**Grammatical analysis:**
- **Function:** Verbal sentence hal
- **Type:** Present tense verb functioning as circumstantial clause
- **Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The brothers (نَحْنُ implied in ذَهَبْنَا)
- **Root:** س-ب-ق (s-b-q) "racing, competing"
- **Pattern:** نَفْتَعِلُ (naftaʿilu) — Form VIII, first person plural present
- **Meaning:** We went WHILE racing (describing their state during departure)

**Narrative insight:** The hal نَسْتَبِقُ is part of their fabricated excuse — they claim they left Yusuf behind because they were busy racing. The circumstantial expression adds realism to their lie.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Hal (Circumstantial Expression) Rules">

**Definition:** Hal (*ḥāl*) is a word, sentence, or phrase that describes the temporary STATE or CIRCUMSTANCE of the subject (or object) when performing (or receiving) an action.

**Three Types:**

1. **Single-word hal (mufrad):** Indefinite accusative noun/adjective
2. **Sentence hal (jumlah):** Complete nominal or verbal sentence (often with wāw al-ḥāl)
3. **Semi-sentence hal (shibh jumlah):** Prepositional phrase or locational expression

**Requirements for single-word hal:**

1. **Must be indefinite** (nakirah / نَكِرَةٌ)
   - No ٱلْـ prefix
   - Not part of iḍāfah construction

2. **Must be accusative** (manṣūb / مَنْصُوبٌ)
   - Takes fatḥah (ـَ) or fatḥatain (ـً) ending
   - Masculine plural: ـِينَ, feminine plural: ـَاتٍ

3. **Describes temporary state**
   - Not permanent characteristic (that would be na't/adjective)

**Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl (Owner of the state):**
- The noun that the hal describes (usually subject or object)
- Must be definite (ma'rifah / مَعْرِفَةٌ)
- Hal agrees with it in gender and number (but NOT case or definiteness)

**Translation helpers:**
- Add "while," "in a state of," "as," or "-ing" to capture the circumstantial meaning
- Example: **jāʾa** **ḍāḥikan** → "He came laughing / while laughing / in a state of laughter"

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes with Hal">

**Mistake 1: Confusing hal with na't (adjective)**

❌ Wrong thinking: "Both describe nouns, so they're the same"

✓ Correct understanding:
- **Hal** describes TEMPORARY STATE during action (indefinite, accusative)
- **Na't** describes PERMANENT characteristic (agrees in all four: gender, number, case, definiteness)

**Test:** Can you make it definite without changing the meaning?
- If YES → it's na't (adjective)
- If NO → it's hal (circumstantial)

**Example comparison:**

****jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلْكَرِيمُ** — "The generous man came"
- ٱلْكَرِيمُ is DEFINITE (matches ٱلرَّجُلُ)
- ٱلْكَرِيمُ is NOMINATIVE (matches ٱلرَّجُلُ)
- This is **NA'T** (permanent characteristic identifying which man)

****jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ **ḍāḥikan**** — "The man came laughing"
- **ḍāḥikan** is INDEFINITE (doesn't match ٱلرَّجُلُ)
- **ḍāḥikan** is ACCUSATIVE (doesn't match ٱلرَّجُلُ)
- This is **HAL** (temporary state while coming)

---

**Mistake 2: Making hal definite**

❌ Wrong: ****jāʾa** مُحَمَّدٌ ٱلضَّاحِكُ** (trying to say "Muhammad came laughing" but making hal definite)

✓ Correct: ****jāʾa** مُحَمَّدٌ **ḍāḥikan****

**Why wrong?** Making ٱلضَّاحِكُ definite changes it from "came WHILE laughing" (hal) to "the laughing one came" (na't identifying which person).

---

**Mistake 3: Forgetting accusative case on single-word hal**

❌ Wrong: **خَرَجَ سَعِيدٌ** (nominative — this just means "Sa'id went out")

✓ Correct: **خَرَجَ **saʿīdan**** (accusative — "He went out happy/while happy")

**Why it matters:** Without the accusative ending, you lose the circumstantial meaning entirely.

---

**Mistake 4: Confusing wāw al-ḥāl with regular "and"**

❌ Wrong translation: ****jāʾa** وَهُوَ يَضْحَكُ** → "He came AND he laughs" (treating وَ as conjunction)

✓ Correct translation: "He came WHILE he was laughing" (recognizing وَ as wāw al-ḥāl)

**Recognition tip:** When وَ introduces a sentence describing the STATE of the subject during the main action, it's wāw al-ḥāl, not a simple conjunction.

---

**Mistake 5: Making ṣāḥib al-ḥāl indefinite**

The ṣāḥib al-ḥāl (the noun being described by hal) must be DEFINITE.

❌ Incorrect: ****jāʾa** رَجُلٌ **ḍāḥikan**** (might be acceptable in some contexts, but typically ṣāḥib al-ḥāl should be definite)

✓ Better: ****jāʾa** ٱلرَّجُلُ **ḍāḥikan**** (definite ṣāḥib al-ḥāl)

**Note:** There are exceptional cases where ṣāḥib al-ḥāl can be indefinite (when the indefinite noun is preceded by a negative or interrogative), but the default rule is that it must be definite.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify whether the underlined word is HAL or NA'T (adjective): **jāʾa** ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ ٱلْجَدِيدُ">

**Answer:**

**ٱلْجَدِيدُ** (al-jadīdu) "the new (one)" is **NA'T** (adjective), NOT hal.

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Check definiteness**
- ٱلْجَدِيدُ is DEFINITE (has ٱلْـ prefix)
- It MATCHES ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ (also definite)
- Hal must be INDEFINITE → This is not hal

**Step 2: Check case**
- ٱلْجَدِيدُ is NOMINATIVE (ends with damma ـُ)
- It MATCHES ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ (also nominative as subject)
- Hal must be ACCUSATIVE → This is not hal

**Step 3: Check meaning**
- "The new teacher came"
- ٱلْجَدِيدُ identifies WHICH teacher (the new one, not the old one)
- This is a PERMANENT characteristic (he IS the new teacher)
- Hal describes TEMPORARY state during action

**Conclusion:** ٱلْجَدِيدُ is NA'T (adjective) because it:
- Agrees in definiteness (both definite)
- Agrees in case (both nominative)
- Describes a permanent characteristic
- Identifies which noun we're talking about

**Translation:** "The new teacher came" (not "The teacher came newly")

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Identify the hal in this sentence and explain why it's hal: **jāʾa** ٱلطُّلَّابُ مُسْرِعِينَ">

**Answer:**

**مُسْرِعِينَ** (musriʿīna) "hurrying" is the **HAL**.

**Analysis:**

**Step 1: Check definiteness**
- مُسْرِعِينَ is INDEFINITE (no ٱلْـ prefix)
- ٱلطُّلَّابُ (the students) is DEFINITE
- They DON'T match → This could be hal ✓

**Step 2: Check case**
- مُسْرِعِينَ ends with ـِينَ (accusative ending for masculine plural)
- ٱلطُّلَّابُ is NOMINATIVE (subject of sentence)
- They DON'T match in case → This is hal ✓

**Step 3: Check meaning**
- "The students came hurrying"
- "Hurrying" describes the TEMPORARY STATE they were in WHILE coming
- You can add "while": "The students came WHILE hurrying" ✓

**Step 4: Check agreement**
- مُسْرِعِينَ is masculine plural
- ٱلطُّلَّابُ is masculine plural
- They AGREE in gender and number ✓

**Root and pattern:**
- Root: س-ر-ع (s-r-ʿ) "speed, haste"
- Pattern: مُفْعِل (mufʿil) — Form IV active participle
- Meaning: "one who hastens" → "hurrying"

**Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** ٱلطُّلَّابُ (the students) — they are the ones in the state of hurrying

**Translation:** "The students came hurrying" or "The students came while hurrying"

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Analyze the hal in this verse: وَدَخَلَ ٱلْمَدِينَةَ *ʿalā* *ḥīni* غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا (Surah Al-Qasas 28:15). What type of hal is it?">

**Answer:**

***ʿalā* *ḥīni* غَفْلَةٍ مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا** (ʿalā ḥīni ghaflatin min ahlihā) "at a time of unawareness from its people" is a **SEMI-SENTENCE HAL** (shibh jumlah).

**Analysis:**

**Full verse translation:** "And he entered the city at a time of unawareness from its people"

**Hal structure:**
- Type: **Semi-sentence hal** (prepositional phrase)
- Phrase: *ʿalā* *ḥīni* غَفْلَةٍ (at a time of unawareness)
- Additional detail: مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا (from its people)

**Grammatical breakdown:**

1. ***ʿalā*** (ʿalā) — preposition "at/upon"
2. ***ḥīni*** (ḥīni) — noun in genitive case (because of preposition *ʿalā*)
   - Root: ح-ي-ن (ḥ-y-n) "time, moment"
   - Meaning: "time"
3. **غَفْلَةٍ** (ghaflatin) — second part of iḍāfah, genitive case
   - Root: غ-ف-ل (gh-f-l) "heedlessness, unawareness"
   - Meaning: "unawareness, inattention"
4. **مِّنْ أَهْلِهَا** (min ahlihā) — additional prepositional phrase
   - مِّنْ = "from"
   - أَهْلِهَا = "its people" (genitive)

**Why it's hal:**
- Describes the CIRCUMSTANCE during which he entered
- The prepositional phrase functions as hal describing the STATE of the city/people
- Answers "WHEN/IN WHAT STATE did he enter?" → "at a time when people were unaware"

**Ṣāḥib al-ḥāl:** The implied subject "he" (referring to Musa ʿalayhi s-salām in the story)

**Narrative significance:** This hal sets the scene — Musa entered the city stealthily when people weren't paying attention, foreshadowing the encounter that would follow.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Convert this sentence with single-word hal to sentence hal using wāw al-ḥāl: خَرَجَ ٱلْقَوْمُ فَرِحِينَ">

**Answer:**

**Original sentence (single-word hal):**
**خَرَجَ ٱلْقَوْمُ فَرِحِينَ** (kharaja l-qawmu fariḥīna)
"The people went out rejoicing"

**Converted to sentence hal:**
**خَرَجَ ٱلْقَوْمُ وَهُمْ فَرِحُونَ** (kharaja l-qawmu wa-hum fariḥūna)
"The people went out while they were rejoicing"

**Analysis:**

**Original structure:**
- خَرَجَ (kharaja) — verb "went out"
- ٱلْقَوْمُ (al-qawmu) — subject "the people" (nominative, definite)
- فَرِحِينَ (fariḥīna) — single-word hal "rejoicing" (accusative plural)

**Converted structure:**
- خَرَجَ ٱلْقَوْمُ — same main clause
- **وَهُمْ فَرِحُونَ** — sentence hal (nominal sentence)
  - **وَ** — wāw al-ḥāl (not "and," but marking circumstantial clause)
  - **هُمْ** — pronoun referring back to ٱلْقَوْمُ (the people)
  - **فَرِحُونَ** — predicate "rejoicing" (nominative because it's predicate in the nominal sentence)

**Key changes:**

1. **Added وَهُمْ:** The wāw al-ḥāl plus pronoun creates a complete nominal sentence
2. **Case change:** فَرِحِينَ (accusative as single-word hal) → فَرِحُونَ (nominative as predicate in sentence hal)
3. **Meaning:** Both versions convey the same meaning, but sentence hal makes the circumstance more explicit

**Why both are valid:**
- Arabic allows both single-word and sentence hal to express the same idea
- Sentence hal can add emphasis or clarity
- Single-word hal is more concise

**Translation comparison:**
- Single-word: "The people went out rejoicing"
- Sentence: "The people went out while they were rejoicing" (more explicit)

**Root:** ف-ر-ح (f-r-ḥ) "joy, gladness"
