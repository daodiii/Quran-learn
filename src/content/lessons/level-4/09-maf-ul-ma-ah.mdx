## Introduction

Arabic has a special construction to express "ALONG WITH" or "IN COMPANY WITH": the **maf'ul ma'ah** (object of accompaniment). This appears after a particular type of waw called **waw al-ma'iyyah** (the waw of accompaniment) and takes the accusative case.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا كُنتَ تَتْلُوا۟ مِن قَبْلِهِۦ مِن كِتَٰبٍۢ وَلَا تَخُطُّهُۥ بِيَمِينِكَ"
  transliteration="wa-mā kunta tatlū min qablihi min kitābin wa-lā takhuṭṭuhū bi-yamīnika"
  translation="And you did not recite before it any scripture, nor did you inscribe one with your right hand"
  reference="Al-Ankabut 29:48"
  highlight="بِيَمِينِكَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَمَا", tr: "wa-mā", en: "and not" },
    { ar: "كُنتَ", tr: "kunta", en: "you were" },
    { ar: "تَتْلُوا۟", tr: "tatlū", en: "reciting" },
    { ar: "مِن", tr: "min", en: "from" },
    { ar: "قَبْلِهِۦ", tr: "qablihi", en: "before it" },
    { ar: "مِن", tr: "min", en: "any" },
    { ar: "كِتَٰبٍۢ", tr: "kitābin", en: "scripture" },
    { ar: "وَلَا", tr: "wa-lā", en: "nor" },
    { ar: "تَخُطُّهُۥ", tr: "takhuṭṭuhū", en: "inscribe it" },
    { ar: "بِيَمِينِكَ", tr: "bi-yamīnika", en: "with your right hand" }
  ]}
/>

While this particular verse uses a prepositional phrase, the concept of accompaniment is central. In this lesson, you'll learn when the waw creates a maf'ul ma'ah in accusative case versus when it functions as a conjunction.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand maf'ul ma'ah as the noun after waw al-ma'iyyah expressing accompaniment
- Distinguish waw al-ma'iyyah (with + accusative) from waw al-'atf (and + coordination)
- Recognize the meaning "along with" or "in company with"
- Identify accompaniment patterns in Surah Hud
- Review ALL FIVE accusative functions in a comprehensive comparison
- Apply morphological analysis to accompaniment constructions

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.08 Maf'ul li-Ajlih](/learn/level-4/08-maf-ul-li-ajlih/), you learned how accusative expresses the REASON for an action. Now you'll see how accusative can express WHO/WHAT accompanies the action. Together with [L4.07 Maf'ul Mutlaq](/learn/level-4/07-maf-ul-mutlaq/), these three lessons complete the specialized accusative functions beyond direct objects.

**Forward connection:** This lesson completes your Level 4 study of accusative case functions. You now understand FIVE major uses of accusative: direct object, circumstance (hal), specification (tamyiz), emphasis (mutlaq), cause (li-ajlih), and accompaniment (ma'ah). These tools enable sophisticated Quranic analysis.

## Understanding the Object of Accompaniment

**Plain English first:** Think of maf'ul ma'ah as "the with-person" or "the along-with-thing." It answers "with whom?" or "along with what?"

**Analogy for clarity:**

Imagine actions with companions:
- "I walked AND my friend walked" → Two separate actions (conjunction)
- "I walked WITH my friend" → One action, with accompaniment (maf'ul ma'ah)

Arabic distinguishes these using different types of waw.

### Arabic Terminology

**Maf'ul Ma'ah** — [mafʿūl maʿah](/resources/glossary/#mafool-maah) (mafʿūl maʿahu / مَفْعُولٌ مَعَهُ)

Literally "the object with it/him." The word **مَعَهُ** (maʿahu) means "with it, along with it."

**Grammatical status:**
- **Case:** Always accusative (مَنْصُوبٌ)
- **Preceded by:** Waw al-ma'iyyah (وَ meaning "along with")
- **Function:** Expresses accompaniment, co-occurrence

**Alternative name:** Sometimes called **اِسْمٌ مَنْصُوبٌ بَعْدَ وَاوِ ٱلْمَعِيَّةِ** (ism manṣūb baʿda wāwi l-maʿiyyah) — "the noun placed in accusative after the waw of accompaniment."

## Waw al-Ma'iyyah vs. Waw al-'Atf

**This is the KEY DISTINCTION.** Arabic has multiple types of waw, and you must identify which type to determine the case:

### Waw al-'Atf (وَاوُ ٱلْعَطْفِ) — Coordinating Conjunction

**Meaning:** "and" (coordination of two equal elements)

**Pattern:** Noun₁ + وَ + Noun₂ (both have SAME case)

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="جَاءَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَعَلِيٌّ"
  transliteration="jāʾa muḥammadun wa-ʿaliyyun"
  translation="Muhammad came and Ali came"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="مُحَمَّدٌ وَعَلِيٌّ"
  words={[
    { ar: "جَاءَ", tr: "jāʾa", en: "came" },
    { ar: "مُحَمَّدٌ", tr: "muḥammadun", en: "Muhammad" },
    { ar: "وَعَلِيٌّ", tr: "wa-ʿaliyyun", en: "and Ali" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **مُحَمَّدٌ** (Muḥammadun) — nominative (subject) — "Muhammad"
- **وَ** (wa) — coordinating conjunction ("and")
- **عَلِيٌّ** (ʿAliyyun) — nominative (also subject, coordinated) — "Ali"

**Both subjects** performed the action of coming. Two separate but coordinated events.

### Waw al-Ma'iyyah (وَاوُ ٱلْمَعِيَّةِ) — Accompaniment Waw

**Meaning:** "along with, in company with, together with"

**Pattern:** Verb/Noun + وَ + Noun in ACCUSATIVE

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سِرْتُ وَٱلنَّهْرَ"
  transliteration="sirtu wa-n-nahra"
  translation="I walked along the river / I walked with the river"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="وَٱلنَّهْرَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "سِرْتُ", tr: "sirtu", en: "I walked" },
    { ar: "وَٱلنَّهْرَ", tr: "wa-n-nahra", en: "along the river" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **سِرْتُ** (sirtu) — "I walked" (main verb)
- **وَ** (wa) — waw of accompaniment ("along with")
- **ٱلنَّهْرَ** (an-nahra) — accusative (maf'ul ma'ah) — "the river"

**ONE subject** (I) performed ONE action (walking), and the river was the COMPANION/SETTING for that action. The river didn't walk — it was the accompaniment.

<Callout type="rule" title="Critical distinction">
**Waw al-'atf** (conjunction): Both nouns have SAME case (coordinated equals)
**Waw al-ma'iyyah** (accompaniment): Following noun is ACCUSATIVE (maf'ul ma'ah)

To identify: Ask "Are there TWO separate actions, or ONE action with accompaniment?"
- Two actions → waw al-'atf (coordination)
- One action + companion → waw al-ma'iyyah (accusative)
</Callout>

## Identifying Waw al-Ma'iyyah

**How do you know when waw means "along with" instead of "and"?**

### Criterion 1: Impossibility of Coordination

If the second noun **cannot logically be coordinated** as an equal subject/object, then waw is ma'iyyah.

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سِرْتُ وَطُلُوعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ"
  transliteration="sirtu wa-ṭulūʿa sh-shamsi"
  translation="I walked along with sunrise / I walked at sunrise"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="وَطُلُوعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ"
  words={[
    { ar: "سِرْتُ", tr: "sirtu", en: "I walked" },
    { ar: "وَطُلُوعَ", tr: "wa-ṭulūʿa", en: "at the rising of" },
    { ar: "ٱلشَّمْسِ", tr: "sh-shamsi", en: "the sun" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:** "Sunrise" (طُلُوعَ ٱلشَّمْسِ) cannot be a coordinated subject that "walked." The sun's rising is the TIME CIRCUMSTANCE, not a co-actor. Therefore, waw = ma'iyyah, and طُلُوعَ is accusative maf'ul ma'ah.

**Translation:** "I walked at sunrise" or "I walked while the sun was rising."

### Criterion 2: Semantic Meaning "With"

If the context clearly means "WITH" or "ALONG WITH" rather than "AND," use waw al-ma'iyyah.

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱسْتَوَىٰ ٱلْمَاءُ وَٱلْخَشَبَةَ"
  transliteration="istawā l-māʾu wa-l-khashabata"
  translation="The water became level with the wood"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="وَٱلْخَشَبَةَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱسْتَوَىٰ", tr: "istawā", en: "became level" },
    { ar: "ٱلْمَاءُ", tr: "l-māʾu", en: "the water" },
    { ar: "وَٱلْخَشَبَةَ", tr: "wa-l-khashabata", en: "with the wood" }
  ]}
/>

**Meaning:** The water rose to be EVEN WITH the wood, not "and the wood" as a separate subject. ٱلْخَشَبَةَ is accusative maf'ul ma'ah.

### Criterion 3: Preceding Negative or Command

After negation or imperative, waw often signals ma'iyyah:

**Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَا تَأْكُلِ ٱلسَّمَكَ وَتَشْرَبَ ٱللَّبَنَ"
  transliteration="lā taʾkuli s-samaka wa-tashrab al-labana"
  translation="Don't eat fish while drinking milk"
  reference="(constructed example)"
  highlight="وَتَشْرَبَ ٱللَّبَنَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "لَا", tr: "lā", en: "do not" },
    { ar: "تَأْكُلِ", tr: "taʾkuli", en: "eat" },
    { ar: "ٱلسَّمَكَ", tr: "s-samaka", en: "the fish" },
    { ar: "وَتَشْرَبَ", tr: "wa-tashrab", en: "while drinking" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّبَنَ", tr: "al-labana", en: "the milk" }
  ]}
/>

**If coordination:** "Don't eat fish and don't drink milk" (two prohibitions)
**If accompaniment:** "Don't eat fish WHILE drinking milk" (one prohibition with circumstance)

Context determines which interpretation applies.

## Examples from Surah Hud

Surah Hud contains narrative passages with accompaniment patterns:

### Example 1: Noah and Disobedience

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَعَصَىٰٓ ءَادَمُ رَبَّهُۥ فَغَوَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-ʿaṣā ādamu rabbahū fa-ghawā"
  translation="And Adam disobeyed his Lord and went astray"
  reference="Taha 20:121"
  highlight="وَعَصَىٰٓ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَعَصَىٰٓ", tr: "wa-ʿaṣā", en: "and disobeyed" },
    { ar: "ءَادَمُ", tr: "ādamu", en: "Adam" },
    { ar: "رَبَّهُۥ", tr: "rabbahū", en: "his Lord" },
    { ar: "فَغَوَىٰ", tr: "fa-ghawā", en: "and went astray" }
  ]}
/>

**Note:** This particular verse uses waw al-'atf (conjunction), not ma'iyyah. But Hud's narratives provide context for understanding accompaniment in action sequences.

### Example 2: Accompaniment in Time

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَالَ يَٰقَوْمِ ٱعْبُدُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ مَا لَكُم مِّنْ إِلَٰهٍ غَيْرُهُۥٓ"
  transliteration="qāla yā-qawmi ʿbudū llāha mā lakum min ilāhin ghayruhū"
  translation="He said, 'O my people, worship Allah; you have no deity other than Him'"
  reference="Hud 11:50"
  highlight="يَٰقَوْمِ"
  words={[
    { ar: "قَالَ", tr: "qāla", en: "he said" },
    { ar: "يَٰقَوْمِ", tr: "yā-qawmi", en: "O my people" },
    { ar: "ٱعْبُدُوا۟", tr: "ʿbudū", en: "worship" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهَ", tr: "llāha", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "مَا", tr: "mā", en: "not" },
    { ar: "لَكُم", tr: "lakum", en: "for you" },
    { ar: "مِّنْ", tr: "min", en: "any" },
    { ar: "إِلَٰهٍ", tr: "ilāhin", en: "deity" },
    { ar: "غَيْرُهُۥٓ", tr: "ghayruhū", en: "other than Him" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:** يَٰقَوْمِ (yā-qawmi) is vocative (مُنَادًى), not maf'ul ma'ah. This demonstrates that not every construction involves maf'ul ma'ah — you must identify the specific grammatical pattern.

### Classical Example Pattern

While full Quranic examples of strict maf'ul ma'ah are less common than other accusative types, the pattern appears in classical Arabic prose and poetry frequently:

**Classical pattern:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="سَارَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ وَٱلْجَيْشَ"
  transliteration="sāra l-amīru wa-l-jaysha"
  translation="The commander traveled with the army"
  reference="(classical example)"
  highlight="وَٱلْجَيْشَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "سَارَ", tr: "sāra", en: "traveled" },
    { ar: "ٱلْأَمِيرُ", tr: "l-amīru", en: "the commander" },
    { ar: "وَٱلْجَيْشَ", tr: "wa-l-jaysha", en: "with the army" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **سَارَ ٱلْأَمِيرُ** (sāra l-amīru) — "the commander traveled" (subject + verb)
- **وَٱلْجَيْشَ** (wa-l-jaysha) — "with the army" (waw al-ma'iyyah + accusative)

ONE subject traveled (the commander), accompanied by the army. The army didn't independently travel as a second subject — it was the accompaniment.

<Callout type="tip" title="Maf'ul ma'ah in Quranic vs. classical Arabic">
Maf'ul ma'ah is a well-established grammatical category in Arabic, but the Quran often expresses accompaniment through prepositional phrases (مَعَ "with", بِ "with") rather than the waw al-ma'iyyah construction. Classical poetry and prose use maf'ul ma'ah more frequently. The grammatical concept remains essential for understanding Arabic's expressive range, even if direct Quranic examples are fewer than other accusative types.

## Five Accusative Functions: Complete Summary

You've now studied FIVE major accusative functions. Here's the comprehensive comparison:

<GrammarTable>
| Function | Arabic Term | Purpose | Pattern | Example | Reference Lesson |
|----------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|------------------|
| **Direct Object** | مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ | Receives action | Verb + acc. noun (different root) | كَتَبَ رِسَالَةً "wrote a letter" | L2.05 |
| **Circumstance (Hal)** | حَالٌ | Describes state during action | Verb + acc. noun/adjective | جَاءَ رَاكِبًا "came riding" | L4.05 |
| **Specification (Tamyiz)** | تَمْيِيزٌ | Clarifies vague quantity/quality | Vague word + acc. specifier | عِشْرُونَ رَجُلًا "twenty men" | L4.06 |
| **Absolute Object (Mutlaq)** | مَفْعُولٌ مُطْلَقٌ | Emphasizes action (same root) | Verb + acc. masdar (same root) | كَتَبَ كِتَابَةً "wrote (emphatically)" | L4.07 |
| **Causal Object (Li-Ajlih)** | مَفْعُولٌ لِأَجْلِهِ | Explains why/purpose | Verb + acc. masdar (reason) | كَتَبَ رَغْبَةً "wrote out of desire" | L4.08 |
| **Accompaniment (Ma'ah)** | مَفْعُولٌ مَعَهُ | Shows accompaniment | Verb + وَ + acc. noun (with) | سَارَ وَٱلنَّهْرَ "walked along the river" | L4.09 |
</GrammarTable>

### Detailed Comparison

**1. Direct Object (مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ)**
- **What it does:** Receives the action directly
- **Root relationship:** Different root from verb
- **Recognition:** Answers "what?" or "whom?"
- **Example:** ضَرَبَ ٱلْكُرَةَ (ḍaraba l-kurata) "struck the ball"

**2. Circumstance — Hal (حَالٌ)**
- **What it does:** Describes the STATE of subject/object during action
- **Root relationship:** No specific root relationship
- **Recognition:** Answers "how?" or "in what condition?"
- **Example:** جَاءَ رَاكِبًا (jāʾa rākiban) "came (while) riding"

**3. Specification — Tamyiz (تَمْيِيزٌ)**
- **What it does:** Clarifies WHAT is meant by vague quantity/quality
- **Root relationship:** Different from modified word
- **Recognition:** After numbers, measurements, or vague adjectives
- **Example:** ٱشْتَرَيْتُ عِشْرِينَ كِتَابًا (ishtaraytu ʿishrīna kitāban) "I bought twenty books"

**4. Absolute Object — Maf'ul Mutlaq (مَفْعُولٌ مُطْلَقٌ)**
- **What it does:** EMPHASIZES or SPECIFIES the verb's action
- **Root relationship:** SAME root as verb (its masdar)
- **Recognition:** Masdar echoing the verb
- **Example:** ضَرَبَ ضَرْبًا (ḍaraba ḍarban) "struck (emphatically, a striking)"

**5. Causal Object — Maf'ul li-Ajlih (مَفْعُولٌ لِأَجْلِهِ)**
- **What it does:** Explains WHY/FOR WHAT PURPOSE action occurred
- **Root relationship:** Usually different root (masdar of reason)
- **Recognition:** Masdar expressing motive (fear, hope, desire)
- **Example:** قَامَ احْتِرَامًا (qāma iḥtirāman) "stood out of respect"

**6. Accompaniment — Maf'ul Ma'ah (مَفْعُولٌ مَعَهُ)**
- **What it does:** Shows WHAT/WHO accompanies the action
- **Root relationship:** No specific relationship
- **Recognition:** After waw al-ma'iyyah (وَ = "with")
- **Example:** سَارَ وَٱلنَّهْرَ (sāra wa-n-nahra) "walked along the river"

<Callout type="tip" title="All six are accusative (منصوب)">
Despite serving completely different functions, ALL SIX take accusative case marking:
- Fatha (ـَ) on singular nouns
- Alif (ى) on dual nouns
- Kasra (ـِ) on sound feminine plurals
- Alif-nun (ينَ) on sound masculine plurals

The CASE is the same, but the FUNCTION differs. Context and pattern determine which type you're analyzing.

## Exercises

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Waw al-'Atf vs. Waw al-Ma'iyyah">

Determine whether the waw is coordinating conjunction ('atf) or accompaniment (ma'iyyah).

**1. جَاءَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَعَلِيٌّ (jāʾa muḥammadun wa-ʿaliyyun) — 'Muhammad came and Ali came'**

WAW AL-'ATF (conjunction). Both مُحَمَّدٌ and عَلِيٌّ are nominative subjects (ـٌ). They are coordinated equals — both performed the action of coming. Two separate events joined by 'and'.

**2. سِرْتُ وَٱلنَّهْرَ (sirtu wa-n-nahra) — 'I walked along the river'**

WAW AL-MA'IYYAH (accompaniment). ٱلنَّهْرَ is accusative (ـَ), not nominative. The river didn't walk — it was the SETTING/COMPANION for my walking. ONE action with accompaniment. ٱلنَّهْرَ is maf'ul ma'ah.

**3. ٱسْتَوَىٰ ٱلْمَاءُ وَٱلْخَشَبَةَ (istawā l-māʾu wa-l-khashabata) — 'The water became level with the wood'**

WAW AL-MA'IYYAH (accompaniment). ٱلْخَشَبَةَ is accusative. The wood didn't 'become level' as a subject — the water became level WITH it. Accompaniment pattern. ٱلْخَشَبَةَ is maf'ul ma'ah.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Identify Accusative Function">

Determine which of the six accusative functions each example demonstrates.

**1. كَتَبَ رِسَالَةً (kataba risālatan) — 'wrote a letter'**

DIRECT OBJECT (مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ). رِسَالَةً receives the action — it's WHAT was written. Different root from verb. Answers 'what?'

**2. جَاءَ رَاكِبًا (jāʾa rākiban) — 'came riding'**

HAL (حَالٌ) — Circumstance. رَاكِبًا describes the STATE of the subject during coming — HOW he came. Answers 'in what condition?'

**3. عِشْرُونَ كِتَابًا (ʿishrūna kitāban) — 'twenty books'**

TAMYIZ (تَمْيِيزٌ) — Specification. كِتَابًا clarifies WHAT the twenty are. Specifies the vague number. Answers 'twenty of what?'

**4. ضَرَبَ ضَرْبًا (ḍaraba ḍarban) — 'struck (a striking)'**

MAF'UL MUTLAQ (مَفْعُولٌ مُطْلَقٌ) — Absolute object. ضَرْبًا is the masdar from same root as verb (ض-ر-ب), emphasizing the action. Answers 'struck HOW MUCH?'

**5. قَامَ احْتِرَامًا (qāma iḥtirāman) — 'stood out of respect'**

MAF'UL LI-AJLIH (مَفْعُولٌ لِأَجْلِهِ) — Causal object. احْتِرَامًا is a masdar expressing WHY he stood — the motive/reason. Answers 'for what purpose?'

**6. سَارَ وَٱلنَّهْرَ (sāra wa-n-nahra) — 'walked along the river'**

MAF'UL MA'AH (مَفْعُولٌ مَعَهُ) — Accompaniment. ٱلنَّهْرَ follows waw al-ma'iyyah and shows WHAT accompanied the walking. Answers 'with what?'

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Multiple Accusatives in One Sentence">

Identify ALL accusative nouns and their functions.

**1. كَتَبَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلدَّرْسَ كِتَابَةً جَيِّدَةً رَغْبَةً فِي ٱلنَّجَاحِ (The student wrote the lesson well out of desire for success)**

Three accusatives: (1) ٱلدَّرْسَ — direct object (what was written). (2) كِتَابَةً جَيِّدَةً — maf'ul mutlaq with type specification (how it was written, same root ك-ت-ب). (3) رَغْبَةً — maf'ul li-ajlih (why it was written — motive/desire).

**2. جَاءَ رَاكِبًا عِشْرِينَ فَرَسًا (He came riding twenty horses - constructed)**

Three accusatives: (1) رَاكِبًا — hal (circumstance, how he came). (2) عِشْرِينَ — part of number construct. (3) فَرَسًا — tamyiz (specification, twenty of what).

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Apply the Complete System">

Analyze the sentence and identify all grammatical elements.

**1. ضَرَبَ ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ ٱلطَّالِبَ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا غَضَبًا (The teacher struck the student severely out of anger)**

Subject: ٱلْمُعَلِّمُ (nominative). Verb: ضَرَبَ (struck). Accusatives: (1) ٱلطَّالِبَ — direct object (whom was struck). (2) ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا — maf'ul mutlaq with type (emphasizes + specifies severe striking, same root ض-ر-ب). (3) غَضَبًا — maf'ul li-ajlih (why — out of anger, motive).

</ExerciseBox>

## Summary

**Maf'ul ma'ah (object of accompaniment) key points:**

1. **Definition:** A noun in accusative case after waw al-ma'iyyah expressing accompaniment ("along with, together with")
2. **Case:** Always accusative (مَنْصُوبٌ)
3. **Preceded by:** Waw al-ma'iyyah (وَ meaning "with"), NOT waw al-'atf ("and")
4. **Function:** Shows WHAT/WHO accompanies or co-occurs with the action
5. **Distinction:**
   - **Waw al-'atf:** Both nouns same case (coordination)
   - **Waw al-ma'iyyah:** Following noun accusative (accompaniment)
6. **Recognition:** If the second noun cannot logically be a coordinated subject/object, waw = ma'iyyah

**Six accusative functions — complete review:**

| Function | Term | Answers | Example |
|----------|------|---------|---------|
| **Direct Object** | مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ | What? Whom? | كَتَبَ رِسَالَةً |
| **Circumstance** | حَالٌ | How? In what state? | جَاءَ رَاكِبًا |
| **Specification** | تَمْيِيزٌ | What type? Of what? | عِشْرُونَ كِتَابًا |
| **Absolute Object** | مَفْعُولٌ مُطْلَقٌ | Emphasis/type/number | ضَرَبَ ضَرْبًا |
| **Causal Object** | مَفْعُولٌ لِأَجْلِهِ | Why? For what reason? | قَامَ احْتِرَامًا |
| **Accompaniment** | مَفْعُولٌ مَعَهُ | With whom/what? | سَارَ وَٱلنَّهْرَ |

**Recognition checklist for maf'ul ma'ah:**
1. Find a noun after وَ (waw)
2. Check if noun is accusative (not nominative/genitive)
3. Ask: Is this coordination (two equal subjects/objects) or accompaniment?
4. If accompaniment → waw al-ma'iyyah, noun is maf'ul ma'ah
5. If coordination → waw al-'atf, noun matches previous case

**Master accusative case strategy:**

When you encounter an accusative noun in Quranic text:
1. **Check for verb object:** Is it receiving the action? → Direct object
2. **Check for state description:** Does it describe HOW? → Hal
3. **Check for specification:** After number/vague word? → Tamyiz
4. **Check for same-root masdar:** Emphasizing verb? → Maf'ul mutlaq
5. **Check for reason masdar:** Explaining WHY? → Maf'ul li-ajlih
6. **Check for waw + accompaniment:** After وَ meaning "with"? → Maf'ul ma'ah

**Mastery achievement:** You can now analyze ANY accusative noun in the Quran using these six categories. This completes your foundational understanding of Arabic case functions.

**Next steps:** In upcoming lessons, you'll apply this complete case system to complex Quranic passages, analyze weak verbs, and study advanced rhetorical devices. Your grammatical toolkit is now comprehensive enough for sophisticated textual analysis.
