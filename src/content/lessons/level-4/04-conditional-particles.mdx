## Introduction

Not all "if" statements express the same level of certainty. When you say "if it rains" (uncertain), "when it rains" (expected), or "if only it had rained" (impossible), you're communicating different levels of expectation. Arabic has distinct particles for each certainty level — and they follow different grammatical rules.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَإِذَا جَآءَ وَعْدُ ٱلْءَاخِرَةِ جِئْنَا بِكُمْ لَفِيفًۭا"
  transliteration="fa-idhā jāʾa waʿdu l-ākhirati jiʾnā bikum lafīfan"
  translation="So when the promise of the Hereafter comes, We will bring you forth in a mixed gathering"
  reference="Al-Isra 17:104"
  highlight="إِذَا جَآءَ"
/>

Notice **إِذَا** (idhā) "when" — not إِنْ (in) "if." The choice signals that this event is EXPECTED, not uncertain. The verb جَآءَ (jāʾa) is past tense (but with future meaning), and it does NOT take jussive mood — no shortened ending.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Distinguish between إِنْ (uncertain), إِذَا (expected), and لَوْ (impossible) on the certainty scale
- Understand which particles trigger jussive mood and which don't
- Recognize how particle choice reveals the speaker's certainty level
- Analyze conditional particles in Surah Yusuf's narrative conditionals
- Avoid the most common error: confusing إِنْ and إِذَا

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.03 Conditional Sentences](/learn/level-4/conditional-sentences), you learned the three-part conditional structure and how إِنْ triggers jussive mood in both verbs. Now you'll see that different particles create different meanings and mood requirements.

**Forward connection:** This lesson completes the conditional logic foundation. In Level 5, you'll encounter [L5.07 Complex Conditional Structures](/learn/level-5/complex-conditionals) with nested conditions and multiple clauses, building on this certainty scale framework.

## Understanding Conditional Particles

**Plain English first:** In English, we use context and helping words to show certainty:
- "**If** I had money..." (uncertain — I don't know if I'll have it)
- "**When** I get money..." (expected — I'm confident it will happen)
- "**If only** I had money..." (impossible — I definitely don't have it now)

Arabic does something more sophisticated — it uses different particles, and these particles trigger different verb forms. The particle choice tells you the speaker's mindset about the condition.

### The Certainty Scale

This is the MOST IMPORTANT concept in conditional particles:

```
IMPOSSIBLE ←————— UNCERTAIN ————→ EXPECTED
    لَوْ              إِنْ             إِذَا
  "if only"           "if"          "when/if"
  (past only)      (jussive)     (no mood change)
```

Think of this as a spectrum of belief:
- **لَوْ** (law) — you're saying "this didn't happen, and I'm imagining if it had"
- **إِنْ** (in) — you're saying "I don't know if this will happen"
- **إِذَا** (idhā) — you're saying "I expect this to happen"

**THE CRITICAL DISTINCTION:** إِذَا is fundamentally a TEMPORAL particle meaning "when," not a conditional particle meaning "if." It evolved to have conditional meaning in certain contexts, but it retains its temporal sense — "when this happens" implies EXPECTATION that it will happen.

This is the single most common error for Arabic learners: treating إِنْ and إِذَا as interchangeable. They are NOT.

## The Six Main Conditional Particles

Arabic has multiple conditional particles, each with specific meaning and grammatical requirements.

<GrammarTable>
| Particle | Transliteration | Meaning | Certainty | Mood Effect | Verb Tense | Used For |
|----------|-----------------|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|----------|
| إِنْ | in | if | Uncertain/hypothetical | **Jussive** (both verbs) | Present | General conditions, unknown outcomes |
| إِذَا | idhā | when/if | Expected/likely | **No change** (indicative) | Past (future meaning) | Expected events, confident predictions |
| لَوْ | law | if/if only | Impossible/counterfactual | **No change** | Past tense | Contrary-to-fact, wishes, regrets |
| لَمَّا | lammā | when (past) | Completed event | **No change** | Past tense | Completed past events |
| مَنْ | man | whoever | General condition (person) | **Jussive** (both verbs) | Present | Universal statements about people |
| مَا | mā | whatever | General condition (thing) | **Jussive** (both verbs) | Present | Universal statements about things |
</GrammarTable>

**Key observation:** Only three particles trigger jussive mood: إِنْ, مَنْ, and مَا. The others (إِذَا, لَوْ, لَمَّا) do NOT change verb mood.

### إِنْ (in) — Uncertain Condition

**Meaning:** "if" (uncertain, hypothetical)
**Mood:** Jussive on BOTH condition and result verbs
**Usage:** When the speaker doesn't know whether the condition will be met

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِن تَنْصُرُوا۟ ٱللَّهَ يَنصُرْكُمْ وَيُثَبِّتْ أَقْدَامَكُمْ"
  transliteration="in tanṣurū llāha yanṣurkum wa yuthabbit aqdāmakum"
  translation="If you support Allah, He will support you and make firm your feet"
  reference="Muhammad 47:7"
  highlight="إِن تَنْصُرُوا۟"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** إِنْ — uncertain condition
- **Condition:** تَنْصُرُوا۟ (tanṣurū) — jussive (nūn deleted from تَنْصُرُونَ)
- **Result:** يَنصُرْكُمْ (yanṣurkum) — jussive (sukūn on ص)

The uncertainty is appropriate here — whether believers will support Allah's cause is not predetermined.

### إِذَا (idhā) — Expected/Temporal

**Meaning:** "when" (expected event), sometimes "if" (but with expectation)
**Mood:** NO mood change — verbs stay indicative
**Usage:** When the speaker expects the condition to happen

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ"
  transliteration="idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wa-l-fatḥu"
  translation="When the victory of Allah comes, and the conquest"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:1"
  highlight="إِذَا جَآءَ"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** إِذَا — expected event (Allah's victory WILL come)
- **Verb:** جَآءَ (jāʾa) — past tense form with future meaning, NO jussive mood
- **Subject:** نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ (naṣru llāhi) "Allah's victory" — nominative

**Why past tense?** With إِذَا, the verb is typically in past tense form even though it refers to a future event. This emphasizes the CERTAINTY of the event — it's so sure to happen, it's spoken of as if it already occurred.

**Critical point:** إِذَا does NOT trigger jussive mood. If you see shortened verb endings after إِذَا, something else is causing them (like a negation particle).

### لَوْ (law) — Impossible/Counterfactual

**Meaning:** "if" (contrary to fact), "if only"
**Mood:** NO mood change — past tense
**Usage:** Expressing wishes, regrets, or hypothetical situations that didn't happen

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَوْ كَانَ فِيهِمَآ ءَالِهَةٌ إِلَّا ٱللَّهُ لَفَسَدَتَا"
  transliteration="law kāna fīhimā ālihatun illā llāhu la-fasadatā"
  translation="If there had been within them [the heavens and earth] gods besides Allah, they would have been ruined"
  reference="Al-Anbiya 21:22"
  highlight="لَوْ كَانَ"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** لَوْ — counterfactual (there ARE NOT multiple gods)
- **Condition:** كَانَ فِيهِمَآ ءَالِهَةٌ (kāna fīhimā ālihatun) — past tense "there had been"
- **Result:** لَفَسَدَتَا (la-fasadatā) — past tense with emphatic لَـ "they would have been ruined"

This is a logical argument: since the heavens and earth are NOT ruined, there CANNOT be multiple gods. The لَوْ particle makes this counterfactual reasoning explicit.

**Usage principle:** Use لَوْ to express:
1. **Regrets:** لَوْ كُنْتُ هُنَاكَ (law kuntu hunāka) "if only I had been there"
2. **Hypotheticals:** لَوْ تَعَلَّمْتُ (law taʿallamtu) "if I had learned"
3. **Logical impossibilities:** As in the verse above

### لَمَّا (lammā) — When (Past, Completed)

**Meaning:** "when" (for past events that already happened)
**Mood:** NO mood change — past tense
**Usage:** Completed events in the past

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ رَسُولٌۭ مِّنْ عِندِ ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="wa lammā jāʾahum rasūlun min ʿindi llāhi"
  translation="And when a messenger came to them from Allah"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:101"
  highlight="لَمَّا جَآءَهُمْ"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** لَمَّا — "when" (past completed event)
- **Verb:** جَآءَهُمْ (jāʾahum) — past tense, no mood change
- **Subject:** رَسُولٌۭ (rasūlun) — nominative

**Difference from إِذَا:** لَمَّا is strictly for PAST events that have already been completed. إِذَا can refer to future expected events.

### مَنْ (man) — Whoever

**Meaning:** "whoever" (general condition about any person)
**Mood:** Jussive on BOTH verbs
**Usage:** Universal statements applying to any person

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَن يَعْمَلْ سُوٓءًۭا يُجْزَ بِهِۦ"
  transliteration="man yaʿmal sūʾan yujza bihi"
  translation="Whoever does evil will be recompensed for it"
  reference="An-Nisa 4:123"
  highlight="مَن يَعْمَلْ"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** مَنْ — "whoever"
- **Condition:** يَعْمَلْ (yaʿmal) — jussive (sukūn on ل instead of ḍamma)
- **Result:** يُجْزَ (yujza) — jussive passive verb

مَنْ functions like إِنْ in terms of grammar — it triggers jussive mood. But it adds the meaning of "any person who."

### مَا (mā) — Whatever

**Meaning:** "whatever" (general condition about any thing/action)
**Mood:** Jussive on BOTH verbs
**Usage:** Universal statements applying to any thing or action

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَمَا تُنفِقُوا۟ مِنْ خَيْرٍۢ يُوَفَّ إِلَيْكُمْ"
  transliteration="wa mā tunfiqū min khayrin yuwaffa ilaykum"
  translation="And whatever you spend of good will be fully repaid to you"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:272"
  highlight="مَا تُنفِقُوا۟"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** مَا — "whatever"
- **Condition:** تُنفِقُوا۟ (tunfiqū) — jussive (nūn deleted)
- **Result:** يُوَفَّ (yuwaffa) — jussive passive verb (no final diacritic, indicating passive construction)

## Examples from Surah Yusuf

Surah Yusuf (Joseph) is narrative-rich with multiple conditional particles showing different certainty levels. Let's analyze how particle choice shapes meaning.

### Example 1: The Brothers' Uncertainty

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَالُوا۟ إِن يَسْرِقْ فَقَدْ سَرَقَ أَخٌۭ لَّهُۥ مِن قَبْلُ"
  transliteration="qālū in yasriq fa-qad saraqa akhun lahu min qablu"
  translation="They said: If he steals, a brother of his has stolen before"
  reference="Yusuf 12:77"
  highlight="إِن يَسْرِقْ"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** إِنْ — uncertain (they don't actually believe Benjamin stole)
- **Condition:** يَسْرِقْ (yasriq) — jussive mood (sukūn on ق)
- **Result:** فَقَدْ سَرَقَ (fa-qad saraqa) — nominal clause with فَ, past tense

**Context:** The brothers are accused of theft. They use إِنْ because they're expressing a hypothetical — they don't truly believe Benjamin is a thief, but they're making a defensive statement.

**Mood note:** The result clause starts with قَدْ (qad), which makes it a nominal-like construction requiring فَ before it.

### Example 2: Expected Recognition

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَلَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟ عَلَىٰ يُوسُفَ ءَاوَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ أَخَاهُ"
  transliteration="fa-lammā dakhalū ʿalā yūsufa āwā ilayhi akhāhu"
  translation="So when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself"
  reference="Yusuf 12:69"
  highlight="لَمَّا دَخَلُوا۟"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** لَمَّا — completed past event
- **Verb:** دَخَلُوا۟ (dakhalū) — past tense, no mood change
- **Result:** ءَاوَىٰٓ إِلَيْهِ (āwā ilayhi) — past tense main verb

**Context:** This describes a completed historical event. لَمَّا is appropriate because it signals "when this actually happened" — not a hypothetical or future expectation.

### Example 3: Father's Wisdom on Certainty

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَمَّا فَتَحُوا۟ مَتَٰعَهُمْ وَجَدُوا۟ بِضَٰعَتَهُمْ رُدَّتْ إِلَيْهِمْ"
  transliteration="wa lammā fataḥū matāʿahum wajadū biḍāʿatahum ruddat ilayhim"
  translation="And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them"
  reference="Yusuf 12:65"
  highlight="لَمَّا فَتَحُوا۟"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** لَمَّا — completed past action
- **Condition:** فَتَحُوا۟ (fataḥū) — past tense (opened)
- **Result:** وَجَدُوا۟ (wajadū) — past tense (found)

**Narrative flow:** The surah uses لَمَّا repeatedly to narrate the sequential events of Joseph's story — each "when this happened, then that happened" moves the story forward with completed actions.

### Example 4: The Governor's Command

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَإِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى بِهِۦ فَلَا كَيْلَ لَكُمْ عِندِى"
  transliteration="fa-in lam taʾtūnī bihi fa-lā kayla lakum ʿindī"
  translation="But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be for you from me"
  reference="Yusuf 12:60"
  highlight="إِن لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى"
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Particle:** إِنْ — uncertain condition (will they bring Benjamin?)
- **Condition:** لَّمْ تَأْتُونِى (lam taʾtūnī) — negated jussive with لَمْ, nūn deleted (تَأْتُونَنِى → تَأْتُونِى)
- **Result:** فَلَا كَيْلَ لَكُمْ (fa-lā kayla lakum) — nominal sentence with فَ

**Context:** Joseph (as the Egyptian governor) is setting a condition — he's uncertain whether the brothers will comply, so إِنْ is appropriate. The negation لَمْ (lam) "not" works with the jussive mood that إِنْ already requires.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
Choose conditional particles based on the certainty level of your condition:

**إِذَا** (idhā) = "when" (EXPECTED events)
- Use for confident predictions, inevitable events
- Verb: past tense form (but future meaning)
- Mood: NO change (indicative)

**إِنْ** (in) = "if" (UNCERTAIN conditions)
- Use for hypotheticals, unknown outcomes
- Verb: present tense
- Mood: JUSSIVE on both condition and result

**لَوْ** (law) = "if/if only" (IMPOSSIBLE/counterfactual)
- Use for contrary-to-fact situations, wishes, regrets
- Verb: past tense only
- Mood: NO change

**Special particles:**
- **لَمَّا** (lammā) = "when" for completed past events
- **مَنْ** (man) = "whoever" → triggers jussive
- **مَا** (mā) = "whatever" → triggers jussive
</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warning">
**MOST COMMON ERROR: Using إِنْ and إِذَا interchangeably**

إِذَا does NOT mean "if" in the uncertain sense. It means "WHEN" — expressing expectation.

❌ **Wrong:** إِذَا دَرَسْتُ أَنْجَحُ (idhā darastu anjaḥu) — if the outcome is uncertain
✓ **Correct:** إِنْ أَدْرُسْ أَنْجَحْ (in adrus anjaḥ) — uncertain, both verbs jussive

The Quran uses **إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ** (idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi) "WHEN Allah's victory comes" because it's certain, not hypothetical.

**Don't use jussive mood after إِذَا**

Only إِنْ, مَنْ, and مَا trigger jussive mood. إِذَا does NOT.

❌ **Wrong:** إِذَا يَذْهَبْ... (idhā yadhhab) — jussive after إِذَا
✓ **Correct:** إِذَا ذَهَبَ... (idhā dhahaba) — past tense after إِذَا

**لَوْ always uses past tense**

Even for present hypotheticals, لَوْ requires past tense forms.

✓ **Correct:** لَوْ كُنْتُ غَنِيًّا (law kuntu ghaniyyan) "if I were rich" — past tense كُنْتُ even though it's about a present hypothetical

❌ **Wrong:** لَوْ أَكُونُ غَنِيًّا (law akūnu ghaniyyan) — present tense after لَوْ

**Don't confuse إِنْ (condition) with إِنَّ (emphasis)**

This was covered in L4.03, but it bears repeating:
- **إِنْ** (in) — one nūn, conditional "if"
- **إِنَّ** (inna) — doubled nūn (shadda), emphatic "indeed"

Only إِنْ triggers conditional structure and jussive mood.

/>

## Summary

Conditional particles in Arabic form a certainty scale from impossible (لَوْ) through uncertain (إِنْ) to expected (إِذَا). Understanding this scale is critical for both comprehension and production.

**The certainty scale:**
- **لَوْ** (law) — impossible/counterfactual → past tense, no jussive
- **إِنْ** (in) — uncertain/hypothetical → jussive mood required
- **إِذَا** (idhā) — expected/temporal → past tense (future meaning), no jussive

**Mood triggers:** Only three particles require jussive mood: إِنْ, مَنْ, and مَا. The others (إِذَا, لَوْ, لَمَّا) do NOT change verb mood.

**The most common error:** Treating إِنْ and إِذَا as interchangeable. Remember: إِذَا is fundamentally "when" (temporal with expectation), while إِنْ is "if" (uncertain condition). The Quranic usage consistently reflects this distinction — expected events use إِذَا, uncertain conditions use إِنْ.

This nuanced particle system allows Arabic to communicate not just the logical structure of conditionals, but also the speaker's mindset about whether the condition is likely, unlikely, or impossible.
