## Introduction

You've completed three weak verb categories: hollow, defective, and assimilated. Now you're ready for the final category: hamzated verbs (al-mahmūz). These are verbs containing hamza (ء) — the glottal stop that changes its "seat" (carrier letter) based on surrounding vowels.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّآ", tr: "innā", en: "Indeed, We" },
    { ar: "أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ", tr: "aʿṭaynāka", en: "have granted you" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَوْثَرَ", tr: "l-kawthar", en: "al-Kawthar" }
  ]}
/>

The word **أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ** (aʿṭaynāka) "We gave you" is from the hamzated root ع-ط-ي (ʿ-ṭ-y). Wait — where's the hamza? It's hidden in the past tense, but appears clearly in other forms: the masdar is **إِعْطَاءٌ** (iʿṭāʾun) "giving." The hamza's spelling changes based on the vowels around it, making hamzated verbs unique among weak verbs.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand hamza seat rules (kasra > damma > fatha > sukūn hierarchy)
- Identify three hamza positions: initial, middle, final
- Recognize common hamzated roots and their conjugations
- Master irregular imperative exceptions (khudh, kul, mur)
- Complete the four-category weak verb comparison
- Apply hamza analysis to Al-Kawthar examples

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L4.11 Weak Verbs Introduction](/learn/level-4/11-weak-verbs-intro/), you learned the four-category system. You've mastered [L4.12 Hollow Verbs](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs/) (middle weak), [L4.13 Defective Verbs](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/) (final weak), and [L4.14 Assimilated Verbs](/learn/level-4/14-assimilated-verbs/) (initial weak). Hamzated verbs complete the system — they're different because hamza doesn't contract or drop like و/ي. Instead, its SPELLING changes while pronunciation stays the same.

**Forward connection:** This lesson completes the weak verb series. With all four categories mastered, you'll move to [L4.16 Introduction to Balagha](/learn/level-4/16-intro-balagha/) (rhetoric), expanding from morphology to stylistics and eloquence.

**Key insight:** Hamza is technically NOT a "weak letter" in the grammatical sense — it's a consonant (glottal stop). But it causes spelling irregularities that justify including it with weak verbs. The good news: conjugation is regular, only the orthography (spelling) changes based on vowel context.

## Understanding Hamzated Verbs

**Plain English first:** Imagine hamza as royalty that must always sit on a throne. The throne can be alif (ا), waw (و), ya (ي), or the line itself (standalone ء). Which throne hamza sits on depends on the vowels around it — like choosing formal clothes based on the occasion. Same person (hamza), different presentation (spelling).

### What Makes a Verb "Hamzated"?

**[Hamzated verb](/resources/glossary/#fil-mahmuz)** (fiʿl mahmūz / فِعْلٌ مَهْمُوزٌ) — verb containing hamza (ء) in any position (initial, middle, or final)

**Examples:**
- **ء-خ-ذ** (ʾ-kh-dh) "taking" — initial hamza
- **س-ء-ل** (s-ʾ-l) "asking" — middle hamza
- **ق-ر-ء** (q-r-ʾ) "reading" — final hamza

**Why "mahmūz"?** The Arabic term مَهْمُوزٌ (mahmūz) means "having hamza." It's a passive participle from the root ه-م-ز (h-m-z) meaning "to insert hamza."

### Hamza vs Weak Letters: The Difference

**Weak letters (و، ي):**
- Contract into long vowels (قَالَْ from ق-و-ل)
- Drop entirely (قُلْ from ق-و-ل)
- Change pronunciation based on conjugation

**Hamza (ء):**
- Pronunciation NEVER changes (always a glottal stop)
- Conjugation follows regular sound verb patterns
- ONLY the spelling (carrier/seat) changes based on vowels

**Key takeaway:** You already know how to conjugate hamzated verbs! The challenge is spelling them correctly. Master the seat rules, and hamzated verbs become straightforward.

## Hamza Seat Rules (The Vowel Hierarchy)

Hamza must sit on a carrier that matches the surrounding vowels. The carrier is determined by a hierarchy:

<Callout type="rule" title="Hamza Seat Hierarchy (Strongest to Weakest)">

**1. Kasra (ِ) → Hamza on ya (ئ)**
**2. Damma (ُ) → Hamza on waw (ؤ)**
**3. Fatha (َ) → Hamza on alif (أ or إ)**
**4. Sukūn (ْ) → Hamza on line (ء) or follows previous vowel**

**Rule:** Compare the hamza's vowel with the vowel of the letter BEFORE it. Use the STRONGER vowel to determine the seat.

</Callout>

### Detailed Seat Rules with Examples

**Rule 1: Kasra wins (strongest)**

If hamza OR the letter before it has kasra, hamza sits on ya (ئ).

Examples:
- **سُئِلَ** (suʾila) "he was asked" — hamza has kasra → sits on ya
- **قَارِئٌ** (qāriʾun) "reader" — letter before (ر) has kasra → sits on ya
- **مَسَائِلُ** (masāʾilu) "questions" — letter before (ا) has kasra effect → sits on ya

**Rule 2: Damma second (strong)**

If neither has kasra, but one has damma, hamza sits on waw (ؤ).

Examples:
- **يُؤْمِنُ** (yuʾminu) "he believes" — hamza has sukūn, but prefix has damma → sits on waw
- **مَسْؤُولٌ** (masʾūlun) "responsible" — hamza has damma → sits on waw
- **رُؤُوسٌ** (ruʾūsun) "heads" — letter before has damma → sits on waw

**Rule 3: Fatha third (moderate)**

If only fatha is present, hamza sits on alif (أ or إ).

Examples:
- **أَخَذَ** (ʾakhada) "he took" — initial hamza with fatha → sits on alif above
- **سَأَلَ** (saʾala) "he asked" — hamza has fatha → sits on alif
- **قَرَأَ** (qaraʾa) "he read" — hamza has fatha → sits on alif

**Rule 4: Sukūn (weakest) or standalone**

If hamza has sukūn and the letter before has sukūn or long vowel, hamza sits on the line (ء) or follows the previous vowel's rule.

Examples:
- **شَيْءٌ** (shayʾun) "thing" — hamza follows long vowel → sits on line
- **قِرَاءَةٌ** (qirāʾatun) "reading" — hamza follows long ā → sits on line
- **يَقْرَءُ** (yaqraʾu) "he reads" — final hamza with preceding sukūn → various spellings acceptable

<Callout type="note" title="Why This Hierarchy?">

The hierarchy mirrors Arabic phonology: kasra is the "tightest" vowel (high front), followed by damma (high back), then fatha (low). Sukūn has no vowel quality. Hamza, being a glottal stop, needs vowel context to determine its orthographic representation.

Think of it like dressing for weather: kasra is winter coat (most protective carrier), fatha is light jacket, sukūn is no coat (hamza stands alone).

</Callout>

## Three Hamza Positions

Hamzated verbs are categorized by WHERE the hamza appears in the root:

<GrammarTable>
| Position | Example Root | Past 3MS | Present 3MS | Imperative 2MS | Translation | Key Feature |
|----------|-------------|---------|-------------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Initial** | ء-خ-ذ | أَخَذَ | يَأْخُذُ | خُذْ | take/took | Hamza drops in some forms |
| **Middle** | س-ء-ل | سَأَلَ | يَسْأَلُ | ٱِسْأَلْ | ask/asked | Hamza seat changes frequently |
| **Final** | ق-ر-ء | قَرَأَ | يَقْرَأُ | ٱِقْرَأْ | read | Hamza maintained in all forms |
</GrammarTable>

### Position 1: Initial Hamza (First Radical)

**Pattern:** Initial hamza often changes spelling based on vowel type.

**Common initial hamza roots:**
- **ء-م-ن** (ʾ-m-n) "believing" → ʾāmana "he believed"
- **ء-م-ر** (ʾ-m-r) "commanding" → أَمَرَ (ʾamara) "he commanded"
- **ء-خ-ذ** (ʾ-kh-dh) "taking" → أَخَذَ (ʾakhada) "he took"
- **ء-ك-ل** (ʾ-k-l) "eating" → أَكَلَ (ʾakala) "he ate"

**Special case:** Form IV doubles the hamza (أَفْعَلَ pattern), creating آ (madda):
- ʾāmana "he believed" — from ء-م-ن, Form IV (أَأْمَنَ becomes ʾāmana with madda آ)

**Key behavior:** In imperative, initial hamza sometimes drops for phonetic ease (irregular forms).

### Position 2: Middle Hamza (Second Radical)

**Pattern:** Middle hamza changes seat frequently based on conjugation vowels.

**Common middle hamza roots:**
- **س-ء-ل** (s-ʾ-l) "asking" → سَأَلَ (saʾala) "he asked"
- **ر-ء-س** (r-ʾ-s) "heading/presiding" → رَأَسَ (raʾasa) "he presided"
- **ب-ء-س** (b-ʾ-s) "hardship" → بَئِسَ (baʾisa) "it was miserable"

**Seat changes in conjugation:**
- Past 3MS: سَأَلَ (saʾala) — fatha → alif seat
- Past 1S: سَأَلْتُ (saʾaltu) — still fatha → alif seat
- Present 3MS: يَسْأَلُ (yasʾalu) — sukūn before, damma after → alif seat (follows fatha pattern)
- Masdar: سُؤَالٌ (suʾālun) — damma → waw seat

**Most variable position** — seat changes frequently!

### Position 3: Final Hamza (Third Radical)

**Pattern:** Final hamza is the most stable — usually sits on alif or line.

**Common final hamza roots:**
- **ق-ر-ء** (q-r-ʾ) "reading" → قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) "he read"
- **ب-د-ء** (b-d-ʾ) "beginning" → بَدَأَ (badaʾa) "he began"
- **م-ل-ء** (m-l-ʾ) "filling" → مَلَأَ (malaʾa) "he filled"

**Seat consistency:**
- Past 3MS: قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) — fatha → alif
- Present 3MS: يَقْرَأُ (yaqraʾu) — fatha → alif
- Imperative: ٱِقْرَأْ (iqraʾ) — fatha → alif
- Masdar: قِرَاءَةٌ (qirāʾatun) — long ā before → line

**Most predictable position** — seat rarely changes!

## Common Hamzated Verb Conjugation

Let's conjugate two hamzated verbs to see the seat changes in action:

### Verb 1: أَمَرَ (ʾamara) "to command" — Initial Hamza

<VerbConjugation
  title="Past Tense: أَمَرَ (ʾamara) 'he commanded'"
  root="ء-م-ر"
>

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Hamza Seat Note |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3MS (he) | أَمَرَ | ʾamara | Initial hamza with fatha → alif above |
| 3FS (she) | أَمَرَتْ | ʾamarat | Same |
| 3MD (they two) | أَمَرَا | ʾamarā | Same |
| 3FD (they two) | أَمَرَتَا | ʾaratā | Same |
| 3MP (they) | أَمَرُوْا | ʾamarū | Same |
| 3FP (they) | أَمَرْنَ | ʾamarna | Same |
| 2MS (you) | أَمَرْتَ | ʾamarta | Same |
| 2FS (you) | أَمَرْتِ | ʾamarti | Same |
| 2MD (you two) | أَمَرْتُمَا | ʾamartumā | Same |
| 2FD (you two) | أَمَرْتُمَا | ʾamartumā | Same |
| 2MP (you) | أَمَرْتُمْ | ʾamartum | Same |
| 2FP (you) | أَمَرْتُنَّ | ʾamartunna | Same |
| 1S (I) | أَمَرْتُ | ʾamartu | Same |
| 1P (we) | أَمَرْنَا | ʾamarnā | Same |

</VerbConjugation>

**Present tense: يَأْمُرُ (yaʾmuru) "he commands"**

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Hamza Seat Note |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3MS | يَأْمُرُ | yaʾmuru | Hamza has sukūn, prefix has fatha → sits on alif |
| 3FS | تَأْمُرُ | taʾmuru | Same |
| 1S | أَامُرُ | ʾāmuru | Initial hamza with fatha → alif (madda آ) |
| 1P | نَأْمُرُ | naʾmuru | Same pattern |

**Imperative: مُرْ (mur) "command!" — IRREGULAR**

The regular form would be *ٱِئْمُرْ* (iʾmur), but Arabic simplifies this to **مُرْ** (mur). This is an irregular exception that must be memorized.

### Verb 2: سَأَلَ (saʾala) "to ask" — Middle Hamza

<VerbConjugation
  title="Past and Present Tense: سَأَلَ (saʾala) 'he asked'"
  root="س-ء-ل"
>

**Past Tense**

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Hamza Seat Note |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3MS (he) | سَأَلَ | saʾala | Fatha on hamza → sits on alif |
| 3FS (she) | سَأَلَتْ | saʾalat | Same |
| 2MS (you) | سَأَلْتَ | saʾalta | Same |
| 1S (I) | سَأَلْتُ | saʾaltu | Same |
| 1P (we) | سَأَلْنَا | saʾalnā | Same |

**Present Tense**

| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Hamza Seat Note |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| 3MS | يَسْأَلُ | yasʾalu | Sukūn before, fatha after → alif |
| 3FS | تَسْأَلُ | tasʾalu | Same |
| 3MP | يَسْأَلُونَ | yasʾalūna | Same |
| 1S | أَسْأَلُ | ʾasʾalu | Same |
| 1P | نَسْأَلُ | nasʾalu | Same |

**Imperative: ٱِسْأَلْ (isʾal) "ask!"**

Regular imperative — hamza maintained with alif seat.

</VerbConjugation>

**Key observation:** Middle hamza (س-ء-ل) has consistent alif seat in Form I because the surrounding vowels (fatha) remain constant. In derived forms or with different vowels, the seat would change.

## Irregular Imperative Exceptions

Three common hamzated verbs have irregular imperatives that don't follow standard conjugation:

<GrammarTable>
| Root | Regular Imperative | Actual Imperative | Transliteration | Translation |
|------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|
| ء-خ-ذ | *ٱِئْخُذْ* | خُذْ | khudh | take! |
| ء-ك-ل | *ٱِئْكُلْ* | كُلْ | kul | eat! |
| ء-م-ر | *ٱِئْمُرْ* | مُرْ | mur | command! |
</GrammarTable>

**Why irregular?** The regular forms (*ٱِئْخُذْ*, *ٱِئْكُلْ*, *ٱِئْمُرْ*) are phonetically awkward — starting with hamza + sukūn + consonant cluster. Arabic simplifies these to single-syllable forms by dropping the initial hamza and prefix vowel.

**Memory aid:** Think of these as "command shortcuts" — quick, sharp orders.

**Quranic examples:**
- **خُذْ** (khudh) — "خُذْ مِنْ أَمْوَالِهِمْ" (Take from their wealth) [At-Tawbah 9:103]
- **كُلْ** (kul) — "كُلْ وَٱشْرَبْ" (Eat and drink) [Al-Baqarah 2:187]
- **مُرْ** (mur) — Similar command forms

<Callout type="rule" title="Memorize the Three Irregular Imperatives">

1. **خُذْ** (khudh) — take!
2. **كُلْ** (kul) — eat!
3. **مُرْ** (mur) — command!

These are high-frequency verbs. Memorize their imperative forms as exceptions.

</Callout>

## Four-Category Weak Verb Summary

You've now completed all four weak verb categories. Here's the complete comparison:

<GrammarTable>
| Category | Arabic | Position | Weak Letter | Key Behavior | Example Root | Example Conjugation | Master Strategy |
|----------|--------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| **Hollow** | أَجْوَف | Middle (2nd) | و or ي | Contracts/drops | ق-و-ل | قَالَْ / يَقُولُ / قُلْ | Learn 3 contraction principles |
| **Defective** | نَاقِصٌ | Final (3rd) | و or ي | Changes/drops at end | ه-د-ي | هَدَىْٰ / يَهْدِي / ٱِهْدِ | Recognize alif maqṣūrah (ى) pattern |
| **Assimilated** | مِثَالٌ | Initial (1st) | و (rarely ي) | Drops in some forms | و-ج-د | وَجَدَ / يَجِدُ / جِدْ | Initial و drops in present/imperative |
| **Hamzated** | مَهْمُوزٌ | Any position | ء (hamza) | Seat changes only | س-ء-ل | سَأَلَ / يَسْأَلُ / ٱِسْأَلْ | Master vowel hierarchy (kasra > damma > fatha) |
</GrammarTable>

**Comparative insights:**

1. **Hollow, defective, assimilated** = letters contract/drop → pronunciation AND spelling change
2. **Hamzated** = only spelling changes → pronunciation stays constant (always glottal stop)

3. **Recognition difficulty ranking:**
   - Easiest: Assimilated (least irregular)
   - Moderate: Hollow, Hamzated (predictable patterns)
   - Hardest: Defective (many forms look identical to sound verbs)

4. **Frequency in Quran:**
   - Highest: Hollow (قَالَْ, كَانَْ, جَاءَْ are top verbs)
   - High: Defective (ه-د-ي, د-ع-و common)
   - Moderate: Hamzated (ء-م-ن, س-ء-ل frequent)
   - Lower: Assimilated (و-ج-د common, but category is smaller)

**The complete weak verb recognition strategy:**

1. **Find the root** — strip prefixes/suffixes
2. **Identify weak letters** — look for و، ي، ء
3. **Determine position** — 1st/2nd/3rd radical
4. **Match to category** — hollow/defective/assimilated/hamzated
5. **Apply category rules** — contraction, dropping, or seat changes

With this framework, you can analyze ANY weak verb systematically!

## Examples from Al-Kawthar

Let's analyze hamzated verb morphology from Surah Al-Kawthar (Chapter 108):

### Example 1: أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ (aʿṭaynāka) "We gave you"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّآ", tr: "innā", en: "Indeed, We" },
    { ar: "أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ", tr: "aʿṭaynāka", en: "have granted you" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَوْثَرَ", tr: "l-kawthar", en: "al-Kawthar" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ** (aʿṭaynāka)
  - Root: ع-ط-ي (ʿ-ṭ-y) — wait, where's the hamza?
  - Verb form: Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern)
  - Pattern: أَعْطَى → Past tense, defective (final ي)
  - Person: 1st plural (نَا suffix "we")
  - Object: كَ suffix "you" (2nd masculine singular)
  - Translation: "We gave you" / "We granted you"

**Where's the hamza?** The Form IV pattern أَفْعَلَ adds an initial hamza, but this verb is from ع-ط-ي (defective, not hamzated root). However, the masdar **إِعْطَاءٌ** (iʿṭāʾun) "giving" DOES show hamza — because the defective ي extends into a glide followed by hamza in the masdar pattern (إِفْعَالٌ → إِعْطَاءٌ).

**Key insight:** Form IV adds hamza regardless of root type. So **أَعْطَى** (aʿṭā) combines:
- Initial hamza (Form IV marker)
- Defective final ي (becomes ى alif maqṣūrah in past 3MS)

This demonstrates how verb forms can layer multiple weak features!

### Example 2: Masdar إِعْطَاءٌ (iʿṭāʾun) "giving"

**Masdar pattern for Form IV defective verbs:** إِفْعَالٌ → إِعْطَاءٌ

- **Root:** ع-ط-ي
- **Form IV masdar:** إِعْطَاءٌ (iʿṭāʾun)
- **Hamza seat:** Final position, preceded by long ā → sits on line (ء)
- **Translation:** "giving" / "granting"

**Seat rule applied:** Long vowel (ā) before hamza → sukūn context → hamza sits on line (ءٌ).

### Example 3: Hidden Hamza in Form IV

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wanḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
  highlight="فَصَلِّ"
  words={[
    { ar: "فَصَلِّ", tr: "fa-ṣalli", en: "So pray" },
    { ar: "لِرَبِّكَ", tr: "li-rabbika", en: "to your Lord" },
    { ar: "وَٱنْحَرْ", tr: "wanḥar", en: "and sacrifice" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**

- **صَلِّ** (ṣalli) — root ص-ل-و (ṣ-l-w), Form II imperative, defective (not hamzated) — "pray"
- **ٱِنْحَرْ** (inḥar) — root ن-ح-ر (n-ḥ-r), sound verb (not weak) — "sacrifice"

No hamzated verbs in verses 2-3. Al-Kawthar's hamzated focus is on **أَعْطَى** (aʿṭā) and its masdar **إِعْطَاءٌ** (iʿṭāʾun), demonstrating Form IV hamza addition and masdar hamza seat rules.

### Example 4: Related Verb — يُعْطِي (yuʿṭī) "he gives"

From the same root ع-ط-ي, Form IV present tense:

- **يُعْطِي** (yuʿṭī) "he gives"
  - Present tense pattern: يُفْعِلُ → يُعْطِي
  - Defective final ي visible in present tense
  - No hamza in conjugated form (hamza is Form IV marker in masdar only)
  - Translation: "he gives"

**Comparison with masdar:**
- Masdar: إِعْطَاءٌ (iʿṭāʾun) — shows hamza in final position
- Verb: يُعْطِي (yuʿṭī) — hamza absent in conjugated forms

This shows that hamza can appear in SOME forms (masdar) but not others (conjugated verb) for the same root!

## The 4-Step Strategy for Hamzated Verbs

Applying the weak verb recognition strategy to hamzated verbs:

**Step 1: Find the root**

Strip prefixes, suffixes, case endings. For hamzated verbs, the hamza is part of the root.

**Step 2: Identify hamza position**

Is hamza the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd radical? This determines conjugation patterns.

**Step 3: Check surrounding vowels**

Apply the vowel hierarchy (kasra > damma > fatha > sukūn) to predict hamza seat.

**Step 4: Verify spelling**

Does the hamza sit on the expected carrier (alif, waw, ya, line)?

**Example application: Analyzing سَأَلْنَا (saʾalnā) "we asked"**

- **Step 1:** Root is س-ء-ل (s-ʾ-l) — middle hamza
- **Step 2:** Hamza is 2nd radical (middle position)
- **Step 3:** Hamza has fatha, letter before (س) has fatha → fatha governs → alif seat
- **Step 4:** Spelling is سَأَلْنَا — hamza on alif (ʾ) ✓ Correct!

1. قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) — fatha → alif
2. قَرَأْتُ (qaraʾtu) — fatha → alif
3. يَقْرَأُ (yaqraʾu) — fatha → alif
4. نَقْرَأُ (naqraʾu) — fatha → alif
5. ٱِقْرَأْ (iqraʾ) — fatha → alif

1. **قَالَْ** (qāla) "he said" — root ق-و-ل
2. **هَدَىْٰ** (hadā) "he guided" — root ه-د-ي
3. **وَجَدَ** (wajada) "he found" — root و-ج-د
4. **سَأَلَ** (saʾala) "he asked" — root س-ء-ل
5. **كَانَْ** (kāna) "he was" — root ك-و-ن
6. **أَمَرَ** (ʾamara) "he commanded" — root ء-م-ر
7. **مَشَىْٰ** (mashā) "he walked" — root م-ش-ي
8. **قَرَأَ** (qaraʾa) "he read" — root ق-ر-ء

**Work through the 4-step strategy for each.**

**Expected answers:**
1. Hollow (middle و)
2. Defective (final ي)
3. Assimilated (initial و)
4. Hamzated (middle ء)
5. Hollow (middle و)
6. Hamzated (initial ء)
7. Defective (final ي)
8. Hamzated (final ء)

## Summary

You've now completed the four-category weak verb classification system:

**Key concepts:**
1. **Hamzated verbs:** Contain hamza (ء) in any position — conjugation is regular, only spelling changes
2. **Hamza seat rules:** Vowel hierarchy (kasra > damma > fatha > sukūn) determines carrier (ya, waw, alif, line)
3. **Three positions:** Initial (often irregular imperatives), middle (frequent seat changes), final (most stable)
4. **Irregular imperatives:** خُذْ (khudh), كُلْ (kul), مُرْ (mur) — memorize these exceptions
5. **Complete system:** Hollow (middle weak), defective (final weak), assimilated (initial weak), hamzated (hamza spelling)

**Common hamzated verbs to remember:**
- **أَمَرَ** (ʾamara) / يَأْمُرُ (yaʾmuru) / مُرْ (mur) — command
- **سَأَلَ** (saʾala) / يَسْأَلُ (yasʾalu) / ٱِسْأَلْ (isʾal) — ask
- **قَرَأَ** (qaraʾa) / يَقْرَأُ (yaqraʾu) / ٱِقْرَأْ (iqraʾ) — read
- **أَخَذَ** (ʾakhada) / يَأْخُذُ (yaʾkhudhu) / خُذْ (khudh) — take
- **أَكَلَ** (ʾakala) / يَأْكُلُ (yaʾkulu) / كُلْ (kul) — eat

**Four-category mastery:**

You've now completed the weak verb series spanning L4.11-15. You can:
- Recognize any weak verb by position
- Apply category-specific conjugation rules
- Understand pronunciation vs spelling differences
- Analyze Quranic weak verbs systematically

**Next steps:**
- [L4.16 Introduction to Balagha](/learn/level-4/16-intro-balagha/) — Move from morphology to rhetoric and eloquence
- [L4.17 Figures of Speech](/learn/level-4/17-figures-of-speech/) — Explore Quranic linguistic beauty

**Remember:** Hamzated verbs are the easiest weak verb category once you master the seat rules. The conjugation is regular — only the spelling adapts to vowel context. Trust the hierarchy, and hamzated verbs become straightforward!
