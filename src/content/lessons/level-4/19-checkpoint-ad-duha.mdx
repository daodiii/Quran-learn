## Introduction

This is the Level 4 Analysis Checkpoint — the most comprehensive exercise in the curriculum so far. You will apply EVERYTHING you have learned across Levels 1 through 4 to a single, complete surah: **Surah Ad-Duha (93)**.

<ArabicExample

In just 11 verses, this surah contains divine oaths, negation particles, defective verbs, emphasis structures, conditional constructions, rhetorical questions, imperative commands, and saja' (rhyming prose). It is a perfect testing ground for every skill you have built.

**What makes this checkpoint different from previous lessons:**
- Previous lessons taught you ONE tool at a time (e.g., defective verbs in L4.13, negation in L4.10)
- This checkpoint requires you to use ALL tools simultaneously on real Quranic text
- You will combine **grammatical** analysis (nahw/sarf) with **rhetorical** analysis (balagha)
- This is the bridge between Level 4 (learning tools) and Level 5 (applying tools to complete surahs)

**Background:** Surah Ad-Duha was revealed to the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) after a period when revelation had paused. Some in Makkah taunted him, saying his Lord had abandoned him. This surah is Allah's direct response — a consolation, a reminder of past blessings, and a set of instructions for gratitude.

## Structural Overview

Before analyzing individual verses, understand how the surah is organized. The 11 verses divide into three clear sections:

<GrammarTable>
| Section | Verses | Theme | Grammar Focus |
|---------|--------|-------|---------------|
| **Oath + Negation** | 1-3 | Oath by morning/night, then negation of abandonment | Oath particle وَ, temporal إِذَا, negation مَا, defective verbs |
| **Promise + Rhetorical Questions** | 4-8 | Future promise, then past blessings recalled through questions | Emphasis لَ, future سَوْفَ, rhetorical أَلَمْ, hal clauses, Form IV verbs |
| **Commands** | 9-11 | Three أَمَّا constructions giving instructions | Conditional أَمَّا, prohibition لَا + jussive, Form II imperative |
</GrammarTable>

**Rhetorical arc:** The surah moves from ASSURANCE (you are not abandoned) to EVIDENCE (look at what Allah has done for you) to ACTION (now respond with these behaviors). Grammar and rhetoric work together to carry the listener through this emotional journey.

**Saja' pattern:** Every verse in the surah ends in the long **-a** sound (alif maqsura): ٱلضُّحَىٰ, سَجَىٰ, قَلَىٰ, ٱلْأُولَىٰ, فَتَرْضَىٰٓ, فَـَٔاوَىٰ, فَهَدَىٰ, فَأَغْنَىٰ, تَقْهَرْ/تَنْهَرْ (near-rhyme), فَحَدِّثْ. This consistent -a ending creates a gentle, soothing rhythm that matches the surah's consoling tone — a hallmark of Quranic [saja'](/resources/glossary/#saja) ([L4.18](/learn/level-4/18-figures-of-speech/)).

## Section 1: The Oath (Verses 1-3)

### Verse 1

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلضُّحَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-ḍ-ḍuḥā"
  translation="By the morning brightness"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:1"
  highlight="وَٱلضُّحَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa-", en: "By (oath)" },
    { ar: "ٱلضُّحَىٰ", tr: "ḍ-ḍuḥā", en: "the morning brightness" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **وَ** — oath particle (waw al-qasam). You encountered this in [L4.06](/learn/level-4/06-emphasis-affirmation/): the oath وَ is one of Arabic's strongest emphasis devices. It puts the following noun into the genitive case.
- **ٱلضُّحَىٰ** — definite noun, genitive case (مجرور) after oath وَ. The word means "the mid-morning brightness" — the time when sunlight is full and warm. The alif maqsura (ى) at the end signals that this word's root ends in a weak letter (ض-ح-و or ض-ح-ي), making it a defective noun ([L2.06](/learn/level-2/06-genitive-case/) for genitive case).

**Rhetorical purpose:** Allah swears by a time of light and warmth — symbolizing hope, clarity, and divine presence. The oath creates immediate emphasis: what follows is guaranteed truth.

### Verse 2

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلَّيْلِ إِذَا سَجَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-l-layli idhā sajā"
  translation="And by the night when it covers with darkness"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:2"
  highlight="سَجَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَٱلَّيْلِ", tr: "wa-l-layli", en: "And by the night" },
    { ar: "إِذَا", tr: "idhā", en: "when" },
    { ar: "سَجَىٰ", tr: "sajā", en: "it covers with darkness" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **وَٱلَّيْلِ** — second oath: وَ (oath particle) + ٱلَّيْلِ (the night, genitive). The kasra ending (-i) shows genitive case clearly.
- **إِذَا** — temporal conditional particle meaning "when" ([L4.04](/learn/level-4/04-conditional-particles/)). It indicates an expected, recurring event — night WILL come, this is certain. إِذَا does NOT trigger jussive mood, unlike إِنْ.
- **سَجَىٰ** — **defective verb!** Root: س-ج-و (s-j-w), meaning "to be still, to cover with darkness." This is a Form I defective-waw verb ([L4.13](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/)). The final و transforms into alif maqsura (ى) in the past tense 3rd person masculine singular, following Principle #1 of defective verb transformation.

**Rhetorical contrast:** Morning brightness (verse 1) paired with night's stillness (verse 2) creates [tibaq](/resources/glossary/#tibaq) (antithesis, [L4.18](/learn/level-4/18-figures-of-speech/)) — light vs. dark, activity vs. rest. Both are under Allah's control; both are blessings.

### Verse 3

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَا وَدَّعَكَ رَبُّكَ وَمَا قَلَىٰ"
  transliteration="mā waddaʿaka rabbuka wa-mā qalā"
  translation="Your Lord has not taken leave of you, nor has He detested [you]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:3"
  highlight="مَا,وَدَّعَكَ,قَلَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "مَا", tr: "mā", en: "not" },
    { ar: "وَدَّعَكَ", tr: "waddaʿaka", en: "has taken leave of you" },
    { ar: "رَبُّكَ", tr: "rabbuka", en: "your Lord" },
    { ar: "وَمَا", tr: "wa-mā", en: "nor" },
    { ar: "قَلَىٰ", tr: "qalā", en: "has He detested" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **مَا** — negation particle for past tense verbs ([L4.10](/learn/level-4/10-negation-particles/)). مَا negates the verb without changing its mood (unlike لَمْ which requires jussive). The verb remains in its standard past tense form.
- **وَدَّعَكَ** — **Form II verb!** Root: و-د-ع (w-d-ʿ). Form II (فَعَّلَ pattern, [L3.12](/learn/level-3/12-form-II-III/)) is recognized by the doubled middle letter (دّ). Form II often adds intensity — وَدَّعَ means "to bid farewell, to leave completely." The كَ suffix is the 2nd person masculine singular object pronoun ("you").
- **رَبُّكَ** — subject (nominative case, ـُ). "Your Lord" — the كَ is a possessive pronoun.
- **وَمَا قَلَىٰ** — second negation. قَلَىٰ is another **defective verb**: root ق-ل-ي (q-l-y), meaning "to detest, to hate." Defective-ya verb, past 3MS — the final ي transforms to alif maqsura (ى), following the same Principle #1 as سَجَىٰ ([L4.13](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/)).

<Callout type="tip" title="Hadhf (Ellipsis) in Verse 3">

Notice that the object pronoun is OMITTED from قَلَىٰ. The full expression would be قَلَاكَ (qalāka, "detested YOU"), but the Quran says simply قَلَىٰ. This is [hadhf](/resources/glossary/#hadhf) (ellipsis, [L4.18](/learn/level-4/18-figures-of-speech/)) — the object "you" is understood from the parallel clause مَا وَدَّعَكَ. The ellipsis serves two purposes: (1) brevity and (2) maintaining the saja' rhyme pattern (-a ending).

</Callout>

**Saja' in Section 1:** ٱلضُّحَىٰ (-a), سَجَىٰ (-a), قَلَىٰ (-a) — all three verses end in the same soft, open **-a** sound. This gentle rhythm matches the reassuring tone: "Allah has NOT abandoned you." The saja' creates audible cohesion across the oath and its response.

## Section 2: Promise and Rhetorical Questions (Verses 4-8)

### Verse 4

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ خَيْرٌۭ لَّكَ مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-la-l-ākhiratu khayrun laka mina l-ūlā"
  translation="And the Hereafter is better for you than the first [life]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:4"
  highlight="وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ,خَيْرٌۭ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ", tr: "wa-la-l-ākhiratu", en: "And the Hereafter" },
    { ar: "خَيْرٌۭ", tr: "khayrun", en: "is better" },
    { ar: "لَّكَ", tr: "laka", en: "for you" },
    { ar: "مِنَ", tr: "mina", en: "than" },
    { ar: "ٱلْأُولَىٰ", tr: "l-ūlā", en: "the first [life]" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **وَ** — conjunctive (not oath here, since the oath has been answered in verse 3)
- **لَ** — emphatic lam (لام التوكيد, [L4.06](/learn/level-4/06-emphasis-affirmation/)). This لَ emphasizes the entire predication — "the Hereafter IS CERTAINLY better." This is one of Arabic's strongest emphasis devices.
- **ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةُ** — definite noun, nominative case (mubtada / subject). "The Hereafter" — from root أ-خ-ر meaning "last, final."
- **خَيْرٌ** — elative/comparative adjective, "better." This is the khabar (predicate), nominative case.
- **لَّكَ** — prepositional phrase "for you" — specifies who the comparison benefits.
- **مِنَ ٱلْأُولَىٰ** — "than the first [life]." مِنَ is the comparative preposition ("than"), and ٱلْأُولَىٰ means "the first" — a feminine superlative from root أ-و-ل. Note another alif maqsura ending maintaining the saja' pattern.

**Rhetorical significance:** The emphatic لَ turns a simple comparison into a divine guarantee. This is not speculation — it is emphasized certainty from Allah.

### Verse 5

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَسَوْفَ يُعْطِيكَ رَبُّكَ فَتَرْضَىٰٓ"
  transliteration="wa-la-sawfa yuʿṭīka rabbuka fa-tarḍā"
  translation="And your Lord is going to give you, and you will be satisfied"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:5"
  highlight="وَلَسَوْفَ,يُعْطِيكَ,فَتَرْضَىٰٓ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَلَسَوْفَ", tr: "wa-la-sawfa", en: "And surely" },
    { ar: "يُعْطِيكَ", tr: "yuʿṭīka", en: "He will give you" },
    { ar: "رَبُّكَ", tr: "rabbuka", en: "your Lord" },
    { ar: "فَتَرْضَىٰٓ", tr: "fa-tarḍā", en: "and you will be satisfied" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **لَ** — emphatic lam again ([L4.06](/learn/level-4/06-emphasis-affirmation/)), now stacked with سَوْفَ to emphasize a future promise.
- **سَوْفَ** — future particle, indicating an action that WILL happen (more distant future than سَـ). Combined with لَ, this creates an emphatic future promise: "He WILL CERTAINLY give you."
- **يُعْطِيكَ** — present tense verb from root ع-ط-و (ʿ-ṭ-w). This is a **Form IV verb** (أَعْطَى / yuʿṭī, [L3.14](/learn/level-3/14-form-IV/)). Form IV is recognized by the أَ prefix in past tense and the يُـ pattern in present. It is ALSO a **defective verb** — the final weak letter (و/ي) transforms in conjugation ([L4.13](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/)). The كَ suffix is the object pronoun "you."
- **فَ** — result/consequence particle. Here it introduces the RESULT of Allah's giving.
- **تَرْضَىٰ** — **defective verb**, Form I, root ر-ض-ي (r-ḍ-y), meaning "to be satisfied, content." The present tense 2MS form. After the فَ of result/consequence, this verb takes the subjunctive mood ([L3.05](/learn/level-3/05-verb-moods/)). In a defective verb, the subjunctive shows as fatha on the final weak letter — here realized as the alif maqsura ending (-a).

**Multiple grammar layers in one verse:** This verse alone demonstrates emphasis (لَ), future tense (سَوْفَ), Form IV derived verb (يُعْطِي), defective verb conjugation (تَرْضَى), the فَ of consequence, and subjunctive mood. This is why checkpoint analysis matters — real Quranic text layers multiple grammar concepts simultaneously.

### Verse 6

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًۭا فَـَٔاوَىٰ"
  transliteration="a-lam yajidka yatīman fa-āwā"
  translation="Did He not find you an orphan and give [you] refuge?"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:6"
  highlight="أَلَمْ,يَجِدْكَ,يَتِيمًۭا,فَـَٔاوَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "أَلَمْ", tr: "a-lam", en: "Did not" },
    { ar: "يَجِدْكَ", tr: "yajidka", en: "He find you" },
    { ar: "يَتِيمًۭا", tr: "yatīman", en: "an orphan" },
    { ar: "فَـَٔاوَىٰ", tr: "fa-āwā", en: "and give refuge" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **أَ** — interrogative particle (hamzat al-istifham). But this is NOT a genuine question — it is a **rhetorical question** ([L4.18](/learn/level-4/18-figures-of-speech/)). The expected answer is "Yes, of course!" Rhetorical questions function as emphatic affirmation: "He CERTAINLY found you an orphan."
- **لَمْ** — negation particle for present tense verbs, triggering **jussive mood** (مجزوم, [L4.10](/learn/level-4/10-negation-particles/), [L3.05](/learn/level-3/05-verb-moods/)). Combined with أَ, the double negative (question + negation) creates a strong positive assertion.
- **يَجِدْكَ** — present tense verb, **jussive mood** after لَمْ (note the sukun on the دْ — the indicative form is يَجِدُ). Root: و-ج-د (w-j-d), meaning "to find." This is actually a **hollow verb** — the first radical و drops in the present tense ([L4.12](/learn/level-4/12-hollow-verbs/)): the expected present form *يَوْجِدُ becomes يَجِدُ with the و deleted. The كَ is the object pronoun "you."
- **يَتِيمًا** — accusative case (ـًا). This functions as a **hal** (circumstantial expression, [L4.01](/learn/level-4/01-hal-clauses/)) — it describes the STATE in which the Prophet was found: "He found you [while you were] an orphan." The accusative case marking confirms its hal function.
- **فَـَٔاوَىٰ** — فَ (sequential conjunction "and then") + آوَى, a **Form IV defective verb** from root أ-و-ي (ʾ-w-y), meaning "to shelter, give refuge." Form IV is recognized by the أَ prefix pattern ([L3.14](/learn/level-3/14-form-IV/)). The verb is also defective — final weak letter becomes alif maqsura in past 3MS.

### Verse 7

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّۭا فَهَدَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā"
  translation="And He found you lost and guided [you]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:7"
  highlight="ضَآلًّۭا,فَهَدَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَوَجَدَكَ", tr: "wa-wajadaka", en: "And He found you" },
    { ar: "ضَآلًّۭا", tr: "ḍāllan", en: "lost" },
    { ar: "فَهَدَىٰ", tr: "fa-hadā", en: "and guided [you]" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **وَجَدَكَ** — past tense of وَجَدَ (root و-ج-د), "He found you." Here in past tense, the initial و of the root is visible (unlike the present tense where it drops).
- **ضَآلًّا** — **active participle** from root ض-ل-ل (ḍ-l-l), meaning "one who is lost, astray" ([L3.19](/learn/level-3/19-active-passive-participles/)). The Form I active participle pattern فَاعِل yields ضَالّ. It is in the **accusative case** (ـًا), functioning as a **hal clause** ([L4.01](/learn/level-4/01-hal-clauses/)) — describing the state: "He found you [while you were] lost."
- **فَهَدَىٰ** — فَ (sequential "and then") + هَدَى, the quintessential **defective verb** from root ه-د-ي (h-d-y), meaning "to guide" ([L4.13](/learn/level-4/13-defective-verbs/)). Past 3MS: final ي becomes alif maqsura. Note the hadhf (ellipsis) again — the object "you" is omitted (understood: فَهَدَاكَ).

### Verse 8

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًۭا فَأَغْنَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ʿāʾilan fa-aghnā"
  translation="And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:8"
  highlight="عَآئِلًۭا,فَأَغْنَىٰ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَوَجَدَكَ", tr: "wa-wajadaka", en: "And He found you" },
    { ar: "عَآئِلًۭا", tr: "ʿāʾilan", en: "poor" },
    { ar: "فَأَغْنَىٰ", tr: "fa-aghnā", en: "and made self-sufficient" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **عَآئِلًا** — another **active participle**, from root ع-ي-ل (ʿ-y-l), meaning "one who is poor, dependent" ([L3.19](/learn/level-3/19-active-passive-participles/)). Accusative case (ـًا), functioning as **hal** ([L4.01](/learn/level-4/01-hal-clauses/)): "He found you [while you were] poor."
- **فَأَغْنَىٰ** — فَ (sequential) + أَغْنَى, a **Form IV defective verb** from root غ-ن-ي (gh-n-y), meaning "to make rich, to make self-sufficient." Form IV adds the causative meaning ([L3.14](/learn/level-3/14-form-IV/)): غَنِيَ "to be rich" becomes أَغْنَى "to MAKE rich." Again, the object "you" is elided (hadhf).

**Pattern in verses 6-8:** Notice the beautiful parallel structure:

<GrammarTable>
| Verse | Finding (State) | Action (Response) | Grammar Pattern |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| 6 | يَتِيمًا (orphan) | فَـَٔاوَىٰ (gave refuge) | Hal + Form IV defective verb |
| 7 | ضَآلًّا (lost) | فَهَدَىٰ (guided) | Active participle hal + Form I defective verb |
| 8 | عَآئِلًا (poor) | فَأَغْنَىٰ (enriched) | Active participle hal + Form IV defective verb |
</GrammarTable>

Each verse follows the same structure: وَجَدَكَ + hal accusative + فَ + defective past verb. The grammatical parallelism reinforces the rhetorical message: Allah's care was CONSISTENT, SYSTEMATIC, and COMPLETE — addressing every dimension of the Prophet's early hardship.

## Section 3: The Commands (Verses 9-11)

### Verse 9

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَأَمَّا ٱلْيَتِيمَ فَلَا تَقْهَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ammā l-yatīma fa-lā taqhar"
  translation="So as for the orphan, do not oppress [him]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:9"
  highlight="فَأَمَّا,فَلَا تَقْهَرْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "فَأَمَّا", tr: "fa-ammā", en: "So as for" },
    { ar: "ٱلْيَتِيمَ", tr: "l-yatīma", en: "the orphan" },
    { ar: "فَلَا", tr: "fa-lā", en: "do not" },
    { ar: "تَقْهَرْ", tr: "taqhar", en: "oppress" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **فَأَمَّا** — the conditional-distributive particle أَمَّا ([L4.04](/learn/level-4/04-conditional-particles/)), preceded by فَ which connects this section to the preceding blessings. أَمَّا means "as for" and introduces a topic-comment structure. It ALWAYS requires a فَ in its response clause.
- **ٱلْيَتِيمَ** — accusative case (ـَ). This is the topic fronted by أَمَّا, placed in the accusative as the object of the following verb.
- **فَلَا تَقْهَرْ** — the فَ is the obligatory response marker of أَمَّا. Then لَا + تَقْهَرْ forms a **prohibition** (نهي): لَا النَّاهِيَة + **jussive mood** ([L3.05](/learn/level-3/05-verb-moods/), [L4.10](/learn/level-4/10-negation-particles/)). The jussive is visible in the sukun on the final letter (تَقْهَرْ not تَقْهَرُ). Root: ق-ه-ر (q-h-r), "to overpower, oppress."

### Verse 10

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَمَّا ٱلسَّآئِلَ فَلَا تَنْهَرْ"
  transliteration="wa-ammā s-sāʾila fa-lā tanhar"
  translation="And as for the petitioner, do not repel [him]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:10"
  highlight="ٱلسَّآئِلَ,فَلَا تَنْهَرْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَأَمَّا", tr: "wa-ammā", en: "And as for" },
    { ar: "ٱلسَّآئِلَ", tr: "s-sāʾila", en: "the petitioner" },
    { ar: "فَلَا", tr: "fa-lā", en: "do not" },
    { ar: "تَنْهَرْ", tr: "tanhar", en: "repel" }
  ]}
/>

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **ٱلسَّآئِلَ** — **active participle** from root س-أ-ل (s-ʾ-l), meaning "one who asks, a petitioner" ([L3.19](/learn/level-3/19-active-passive-participles/)). The Form I active participle pattern فَاعِل yields سَائِل. Accusative case (ـَ), functioning as the fronted topic of أَمَّا.
- **فَلَا تَنْهَرْ** — same prohibition structure as verse 9: فَ (response of أَمَّا) + لَا (prohibition) + تَنْهَرْ (jussive mood, root ن-ه-ر, "to rebuke harshly, repel").

**Saja' connection between verses 9 and 10:** تَقْهَرْ (-ar) and تَنْهَرْ (-ar) share the same ending consonant pattern. While the full -a saja' pattern shifts slightly in these command verses, the internal rhyme between تَقْهَرْ and تَنْهَرْ creates its own sonic cohesion.

### Verse 11

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَمَّا بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ فَحَدِّثْ"
  transliteration="wa-ammā bi-niʿmati rabbika fa-ḥaddith"
  translation="But as for the favor of your Lord, report [it]"
  reference="Ad-Duha 93:11"
  highlight="بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ,فَحَدِّثْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَأَمَّا", tr: "wa-ammā", en: "And as for" },
    { ar: "بِنِعْمَةِ", tr: "bi-niʿmati", en: "the favor of" },
    { ar: "رَبِّكَ", tr: "rabbika", en: "your Lord" },
    { ar: "فَحَدِّثْ", tr: "fa-ḥaddith", en: "report [it]" }

**Grammatical analysis:**

- **بِنِعْمَةِ رَبِّكَ** — preposition بِ + نِعْمَةِ (genitive after بِ) + رَبِّكَ (genitive in idafah construction, [L2.07](/learn/level-2/07-idafah-construction/)-[L2.08](/learn/level-2/08-idafah-practice/)). "With/regarding the favor of your Lord." The entire prepositional phrase is the fronted topic of أَمَّا.
- **فَحَدِّثْ** — فَ (response of أَمَّا) + حَدِّثْ, a **Form II imperative!** Root: ح-د-ث (ḥ-d-th), meaning "to speak about, to report." Form II (فَعِّلْ pattern, [L3.12](/learn/level-3/12-form-II-III/)) is recognized by the doubled middle letter (دِّ) with shadda. The imperative mood shows in the sukun on the final letter. Form II here means "to narrate, to proclaim" — making the basic root meaning (ح-د-ث "happening/news") intensive: not just mention, but PROCLAIM and SHARE.

<Callout type="note" title="The Three Commands Mirror the Three Blessings">

The commands in verses 9-11 correspond directly to the blessings in verses 6-8:

| Blessing Received | Command Given |
|-------------------|---------------|
| You were an orphan, He gave refuge (v.6) | Do not oppress the orphan (v.9) |
| You were lost, He guided (v.7) | Do not repel the one who asks (v.10) |
| You were poor, He enriched (v.8) | Proclaim the favor of your Lord (v.11) |

This chiastic structure — blessings then matching commands — is a rhetorical device that ties the surah's theology to its ethics: because Allah helped YOU, now help OTHERS.

## Exercises

<ExerciseBox
  question="Exercise 1: Identify All Weak Verbs"
>

List every defective verb in Surah Ad-Duha. For each one, give the root, state whether it is defective-waw or defective-ya, and identify its verb form (I, II, or IV).


**Hint:** There are seven defective verbs in the surah. Look for alif maqsura (ى) endings on verbs — this is the signature of a defective verb in past tense 3MS.

**Expected answers:**

1. **سَجَىٰ** (v.2) — Root: س-ج-و, defective-waw, Form I
2. **قَلَىٰ** (v.3) — Root: ق-ل-ي, defective-ya, Form I
3. **يُعْطِيكَ** (v.5) — Root: ع-ط-و, defective, Form IV
4. **تَرْضَىٰ** (v.5) — Root: ر-ض-ي, defective-ya, Form I
5. **آوَىٰ** (v.6) — Root: أ-و-ي, defective, Form IV
6. **هَدَىٰ** (v.7) — Root: ه-د-ي, defective-ya, Form I
7. **أَغْنَىٰ** (v.8) — Root: غ-ن-ي, defective-ya, Form IV

**Bonus:** Also note that يَجِدْ (v.6) is a hollow verb (root و-ج-د, middle weak letter drops in present tense). Surah Ad-Duha contains EIGHT weak verbs in 11 verses!

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox
  question="Exercise 2: Identify Verb Forms"
>

For each verb below from Surah Ad-Duha, identify whether it is Form I, Form II, or Form IV. Explain HOW you recognize the form.


1. **سَجَىٰ** (v.2) — "it covered with darkness"
2. **وَدَّعَ** (v.3) — "took leave of"
3. **يُعْطِي** (v.5) — "gives"
4. **آوَىٰ** (v.6) — "gave refuge"
5. **هَدَىٰ** (v.7) — "guided"
6. **أَغْنَىٰ** (v.8) — "enriched"
7. **حَدِّثْ** (v.11) — "report!"

**Expected answers:**

1. **سَجَىٰ** — Form I. Recognition: No extra letters; base فَعَلَ pattern (s-j-w).
2. **وَدَّعَ** — Form II. Recognition: Doubled middle letter (shadda on the دّ). فَعَّلَ pattern.
3. **يُعْطِي** — Form IV. Recognition: Present tense pattern يُفْعِلُ with damma prefix and kasra before final radical. Past tense would be أَعْطَى.
4. **آوَىٰ** — Form IV. Recognition: The أَ prefix (elongated to آ because root starts with hamza). أَفْعَلَ pattern.
5. **هَدَىٰ** — Form I. Recognition: No extra letters; base فَعَلَ pattern (h-d-y).
6. **أَغْنَىٰ** — Form IV. Recognition: The أَ prefix. أَفْعَلَ pattern.
7. **حَدِّثْ** — Form II imperative. Recognition: Doubled middle letter (shadda on the دِّ). Imperative of فَعِّلْ pattern.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox
  question="Exercise 3: Find All Emphasis Devices"
>

Identify every instance of emphasis or rhetorical intensification in Surah Ad-Duha. Include oath structures, emphasis particles, rhetorical questions, and repetition patterns.


**Expected answers:**

1. **Oath by ٱلضُّحَىٰ** (v.1) — Divine oath (وَ + genitive noun). Oaths are inherently emphatic.
2. **Oath by ٱلَّيْلِ** (v.2) — Second divine oath. Double oath = increased emphasis.
3. **Emphatic لَ on ٱلْـَٔاخِرَةُ** (v.4) — وَلَلْـَٔاخِرَةُ. The لَام التوكيد emphasizes that the Hereafter IS CERTAINLY better.
4. **Emphatic لَ + سَوْفَ** (v.5) — وَلَسَوْفَ. Two emphasis devices stacked: لَ (emphasis particle) + سَوْفَ (future certainty). "He WILL CERTAINLY give you."
5. **Rhetorical question أَلَمْ** (v.6) — The combination of interrogative أَ + negation لَمْ creates emphatic affirmation through double negative. "Did He not find you?" = "He CERTAINLY found you!"
6. **Parallel repetition** (v.6-8) — The triple repetition of the "found you X, then did Y" pattern creates cumulative emphasis on Allah's consistent care.
7. **Triple أَمَّا structure** (v.9-11) — Three parallel commands create rhythmic emphasis on the required response to blessings.
8. **Saja' pattern** (entire surah) — The consistent -a rhyme scheme is itself a badi' device that binds the surah into a unified, memorable whole.

<ExerciseBox
  question="Exercise 4: Full Analysis of Verses 6-8"
>

Perform a complete grammatical AND rhetorical analysis of verses 6, 7, and 8 together. Address every grammatical structure and explain the rhetorical effect of the parallel construction.


**Verses:**
- أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًۭا فَـَٔاوَىٰ (v.6)
- وَوَجَدَكَ ضَآلًّۭا فَهَدَىٰ (v.7)
- وَوَجَدَكَ عَآئِلًۭا فَأَغْنَىٰ (v.8)

**Expected analysis:**

**Grammatical analysis of each verse:**

*Verse 6:*
- أَ: interrogative particle (rhetorical question)
- لَمْ: negation particle triggering jussive mood
- يَجِدْكَ: hollow verb (root و-ج-د), jussive mood (sukun on دْ), "He find you"
- يَتِيمًا: hal clause (accusative, describing state — "as an orphan")
- فَـَٔاوَىٰ: فَ sequential + Form IV defective verb (root أ-و-ي), past 3MS

*Verse 7:*
- وَوَجَدَكَ: past tense (root و-ج-د shows initial و in past), "He found you"
- ضَآلًّا: active participle (root ض-ل-ل), accusative hal ("while lost")
- فَهَدَىٰ: فَ sequential + Form I defective-ya verb (root ه-د-ي), past 3MS

*Verse 8:*
- وَوَجَدَكَ: same as verse 7
- عَآئِلًا: active participle (root ع-ي-ل), accusative hal ("while poor")
- فَأَغْنَىٰ: فَ sequential + Form IV defective-ya verb (root غ-ن-ي), past 3MS

**Rhetorical analysis:**

1. **Parallel structure:** All three verses follow identical syntax — verb + object pronoun + hal accusative + فَ + response verb. This creates a rhythmic pattern that underscores Allah's SYSTEMATIC care.

2. **Progression:** The three states form a logical sequence — physical vulnerability (orphan) then spiritual need (lost) then material need (poor). Allah addressed EVERY dimension of human need.

3. **Hal clauses:** The use of accusative hal in all three verses (يَتِيمًا, ضَآلًّا, عَآئِلًا) emphasizes TEMPORARY states — the Prophet was not PERMANENTLY orphaned, lost, or poor. The hal structure grammatically encodes the idea that these were conditions Allah would change.

4. **Hadhf (ellipsis):** The object pronoun "you" is omitted from the response verbs in verses 7 and 8 (فَهَدَى not فَهَدَاكَ, فَأَغْنَى not فَأَغْنَاكَ). This serves (a) brevity, (b) maintaining saja', and (c) universalizing the message — Allah guides and enriches not just the Prophet but all who are in need.

5. **Active participles as hal:** ضَآلًّا and عَآئِلًا are active participles functioning as hal — combining morphological knowledge (L3.19 participles) with syntactic knowledge (L4.01 hal). This is exactly the kind of layered analysis that Level 4 mastery enables.

6. **Rhetorical question (v.6) vs. statements (v.7-8):** Verse 6 uses the powerful أَلَمْ rhetorical question to open the series with maximum impact, then verses 7-8 shift to direct statements. The opening question demands engagement; the following statements build cumulative force.

## Summary

You have just completed the most comprehensive analysis exercise in the curriculum. In 11 verses, Surah Ad-Duha required you to deploy skills from every level:

**From Level 1-2:** Basic sentence recognition, case identification (nominative, accusative, genitive), idafah construction, prepositions.

**From Level 3:** Root extraction, verb form identification (Forms I, II, IV), active participle recognition, verb moods (jussive, subjunctive, imperative), and the فَ conjunction.

**From Level 4:** Hal clauses (circumstantial accusatives), conditional particles (إِذَا, أَمَّا), negation particles (مَا, لَمْ, لَا), emphasis structures (لَ, oaths, rhetorical questions), defective verb conjugation, and rhetorical devices (saja', hadhf, tibaq, parallel structure).

**The key insight:** Real Quranic text does not use ONE grammar concept at a time. A single verse like أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَـَٔاوَىٰ contains a rhetorical question, negation particle, jussive mood, a hollow verb, a hal clause, a sequential conjunction, and a Form IV defective verb — all working together to create meaning. Your ability to identify and integrate all these elements IS the mastery that Level 4 has built.

**Celebrating Level 4 mastery:** You started Level 4 with a solid foundation in basic grammar and morphology. You now finish with the ability to perform sophisticated, multi-layered analysis of complete Quranic passages. You can identify weak verb categories, explain emphasis structures, recognize rhetorical devices, and show how grammar serves theological purpose.

**Looking ahead to Level 5:** Level 5 takes this exact skill — analyzing complete texts with all your tools — and applies it systematically across longer and more complex surahs. You will analyze Al-Fatiha verse by verse, explore Ayat al-Kursi in depth, study narrative structures, and develop your appreciation of Quranic i'jaz (inimitability) through repeated practice. Level 4 gave you the toolkit. Level 5 teaches you the craft. You are ready.
