## Introduction

In [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you learned the base verb pattern — the simplest form with just three root letters and vowels. Now you're ready to see how Arabic TRANSFORMS that base verb to create new meanings.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا"
  transliteration="wa-ʿallama ādama l-asmāʾa kullahā"
  translation="And He taught Adam the names, all of them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:31"
  highlight="عَلَّمَ"
/>

Look carefully at the word **عَلَّمَ** (ʿallama) "He taught." Notice the [shadda](/resources/glossary#shaddah) (shaddah / شَدَّة) — the mark (ـّ) over the middle letter ل. This doubled consonant is the marker of Form II.

The root is ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge." Form I from this root is عَلِمَ (ʿalima) "he knew" — simple knowledge. But Form II عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) means "he taught" — he CAUSED someone to know. The doubled middle letter transforms the meaning from simple knowing to causing knowledge.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize the Form II pattern (faʿʿala / فَعَّلَ) with doubled middle root letter
- Understand Form II's three main meanings: causative, intensive, and transitive
- Identify Form II verbs in the Quran and explain the semantic shift from Form I
- Learn representative conjugation forms for Form II verbs

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you mastered identifying the base, unaugmented verb pattern. Form II is the first **derived form** — it takes Form I and adds augmentation to create new meaning. This is how Arabic multiplies vocabulary from a single root.

**Forward connection:** Form II is the foundation for understanding [Form V](/learn/level-3/verb-form-v), which adds تَ prefix to Form II for reflexive meaning. Mastering Form II's doubled-middle pattern now prepares you for the entire family of intensive/causative verb forms.

## Understanding Form II

**Plain English first:** Form II takes a simple action and makes it MORE — more intense, more forceful, or directed TOWARD someone. If Form I is "break," Form II is "shatter." If Form I is "know," Form II is "teach." The doubled middle letter literally doubles the power of the verb.

Think of it like the difference between these English pairs:
- "know" → "teach" (you make someone know)
- "break" → "shatter" (you break intensely, thoroughly)
- "descend" → "send down" (you make something descend)

In English, we often need different words entirely. In Arabic, you just double the middle letter of the root. It's a systematic transformation.

**The Form II pattern: فَعَّلَ (faʿʿala)**

The template فَعَّلَ shows the Form II structure:
- **ف** (fa) = position of the FIRST root letter
- **عّ** (ʿʿ) = position of the SECOND root letter — **DOUBLED** (marked with shadda ـّ)
- **ل** (la) = position of the THIRD root letter

**Visual pattern breakdown:**

```
Root: ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"

Form I pattern:  فَعِلَ  →  عَلِمَ  "he knew"
                 (3 letters, no doubling)

Form II pattern: فَعَّلَ  →  عَلَّمَ  "he taught"
                 (middle letter doubled with shadda)
```

The shadda (ـّ) over the ل marks the doubling. This is the KEY identifier for Form II.

### The Three Meanings of Form II

Form II expresses three related types of meaning transformation:

**1. Causative — "make someone do the action"**

The most common Form II meaning. You take the Form I action and CAUSE it to happen to someone else.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form II: Causative Transformation"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form II", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ع-ل-م", "عَلِمَ", "he knew", "عَلَّمَ", "he taught (caused to know)"],
    ["ف-ه-م", "فَهِمَ", "he understood", "فَهَّمَ", "he explained (caused to understand)"],
    ["ن-ز-ل", "نَزَلَ", "he descended", "نَزَّلَ", "he sent down (caused to descend)"],
    ["خ-ر-ج", "خَرَجَ", "he went out", "خَرَّجَ", "he brought out (caused to go out)"]
  ]}
/>

**2. Intensive — "do the action intensely or repeatedly"**

Form II can add intensity or repetition to the base action.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form II: Intensive Transformation"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form II", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ك-س-ر", "كَسَرَ", "he broke", "كَسَّرَ", "he shattered (broke intensely)"],
    ["ق-ط-ع", "قَطَعَ", "he cut", "قَطَّعَ", "he cut into pieces (cut repeatedly)"],
    ["ف-ر-ق", "فَرَقَ", "he separated", "فَرَّقَ", "he scattered (separated thoroughly)"],
    ["ع-ذ-ب", "عَذَبَ", "he punished", "عَذَّبَ", "he tormented (punished severely)"]
  ]}
/>

**3. Transitive — "make an intransitive verb transitive"**

Form II can take a verb that doesn't need an object and give it an object.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form II: Transitive Transformation"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form II", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ق-د-س", "قَدُسَ", "it was holy", "قَدَّسَ", "he sanctified (made holy)"],
    ["ط-ه-ر", "طَهُرَ", "it was pure", "طَهَّرَ", "he purified (made pure)"],
    ["ك-ب-ر", "كَبُرَ", "it was great", "كَبَّرَ", "he magnified (made great)"],
    ["ح-س-ن", "حَسُنَ", "it was beautiful", "حَسَّنَ", "he beautified (made beautiful)"]
  ]}
/>

### Arabic Terminology

**Form II** — [Tafʿil](/resources/glossary#tafil) (tafʿīl / تَفْعِيلٌ)

The term تَفْعِيلٌ (tafʿīlun) literally means "intensification" or "causation." This form is called تَفْعِيلٌ because its verbal noun pattern is تَفْعِيلٌ (e.g., تَعْلِيمٌ taʿlīmun "teaching" from عَلَّمَ).

**Doubled middle letter** — [Tadʿif](/resources/glossary#tadif) (taḍʿīf / تَضْعِيفٌ)

The grammatical term for doubling a consonant is تَضْعِيفٌ (taḍʿīfun), from the root ض-ع-ف meaning "to double, to multiply."

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Form II verbs from Surah Al-Baqarah and see the pattern in action.

### Example 1: عَلَّمَ — "He taught"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا"
  transliteration="wa-ʿallama ādama l-asmāʾa kullahā"
  translation="And He taught Adam the names, all of them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:31"
  highlight="عَلَّمَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **عَلَّمَ** (ʿallama) — "He taught"
  - **Root:** ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
  - **Pattern:** فَعَّلَ (Form II with doubled middle letter)
  - **Form II marker:** Shadda (ـّ) on ل
  - **Function:** Past tense verb, third person masculine singular
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I عَلِمَ "he knew" → Form II عَلَّمَ "he taught" (causative)
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple knowledge → causing knowledge in another person

**Form I comparison:**
- Form I: عَلِمَ (ʿalima) — "he knew" (فَعِلَ pattern, kasra on middle letter)
- Form II: عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "he taught" (فَعَّلَ pattern, fatha + shadda on middle)

The doubled ل changes everything: from passive knowledge to active teaching.

### Example 2: نَزَّلَ — "He sent down"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَنزَلْنَا إِلَيْكَ ٱلذِّكْرَ لِتُبَيِّنَ لِلنَّاسِ مَا نُزِّلَ إِلَيْهِمْ"
  transliteration="wa-anzalnā ilayka dh-dhikra li-tubayyina li-n-nāsi mā nuzzila ilayhim"
  translation="And We have revealed to you the reminder that you may make clear to the people what was sent down to them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:187"
  highlight="نُزِّلَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **نُزِّلَ** (nuzzila) — "it was sent down" (passive voice)
  - **Root:** ن-ز-ل (n-z-l) "descending"
  - **Pattern:** فُعِّلَ (Form II passive with doubled middle letter)
  - **Form II marker:** Shadda (ـّ) on ز
  - **Function:** Past tense passive verb, third person masculine singular
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I نَزَلَ "he descended" → Form II نَزَّلَ "he sent down" (causative)
  - **Passive meaning:** "it was sent down" (action done TO the subject)

**Form I comparison:**
- Form I: نَزَلَ (nazala) — "he descended" (movement downward by itself)
- Form II: نَزَّلَ (nazzala) — "he sent down" (caused something to descend)
- Form II passive: نُزِّلَ (nuzzila) — "it was sent down"

The Quran frequently uses Form II نَزَّلَ for revelation because Allah SENDS DOWN the revelation — He causes it to descend.

### Example 3: صَدَّقَ — "He believed in, confirmed"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَإِذَا قِيلَ لَهُمْ آمِنُوا بِمَا أَنزَلَ ٱللَّهُ قَالُوا نُؤْمِنُ بِمَا أُنزِلَ عَلَيْنَا وَيَكْفُرُونَ بِمَا وَرَاءَهُۥ وَهُوَ ٱلْحَقُّ مُصَدِّقًا لِّمَا مَعَهُمْ"
  transliteration="wa-idhā qīla lahum āminū bi-mā anzala llāhu qālū nuʾminu bi-mā unzila ʿalaynā wa-yakfurūna bi-mā warāʾahu wa-huwa l-ḥaqqu muṣaddiqan li-mā maʿahum"
  translation="And when it is said to them, 'Believe in what Allah has revealed,' they say, 'We believe in what was revealed to us.' And they disbelieve in what came after it, while it is the truth confirming that which is with them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:91"
  highlight="مُصَدِّقًا"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **مُصَدِّقًا** (muṣaddiqan) — "confirming"
  - **Root:** ص-د-ق (ṣ-d-q) "truthfulness"
  - **Pattern:** مُفَعِّل (Form II active participle)
  - **Form II marker:** Shadda (ـّ) on د in the root form صَدَّقَ
  - **Function:** Active participle in accusative case (circumstantial state)
  - **Case marker:** Tanween fathatain (ـًا) marks accusative
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I صَدَقَ "he was truthful" → Form II صَدَّقَ "he confirmed, believed in" (intensive/causative)
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple truthfulness → actively confirming truth

**Note:** This is the active participle (مُفَعِّل pattern) derived from Form II verb صَدَّقَ. You'll learn participles in [L3.16](/learn/level-3/active-passive-participles).

### Example 4: كَذَّبَ — "He denied, rejected"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَقَدْ كَذَّبُوا بِٱلْحَقِّ لَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ"
  transliteration="fa-qad kadhdhabū bi-l-ḥaqqi lammā jāʾahum"
  translation="For they had denied the truth when it came to them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:89"
  highlight="كَذَّبُوا"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **كَذَّبُوا** (kadhdhabū) — "they denied"
  - **Root:** ك-ذ-ب (k-dh-b) "lying, falsehood"
  - **Pattern:** فَعَّلَ (Form II past tense, third person masculine plural)
  - **Form II marker:** Shadda (ـّ) on ذ
  - **Function:** Past tense verb with plural subject pronoun وا
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I كَذَبَ "he lied" → Form II كَذَّبَ "he denied, rejected" (intensive)
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple lying → active, forceful rejection of truth

**Form I comparison:**
- Form I: كَذَبَ (kadhaba) — "he lied" (told falsehood)
- Form II: كَذَّبَ (kadhdhaba) — "he denied, rejected" (called something a lie, intensive rejection)

The doubled ذ intensifies the action: not just lying, but actively rejecting and denying truth.

## Form II Conjugation

Form II conjugates using the same suffix pattern as Form I (see [L3.03 Past Tense](/learn/level-3/past-tense)). Only the verb stem changes — the doubled middle letter remains throughout.

### Representative Past Tense Conjugation

We'll show 8 representative persons (not the full 14) to illustrate the pattern:

<VerbConjugation
  root="ع-ل-م"
  form="Form II"
  pattern="فَعَّلَ"
  headers={["Person", "Arabic", "Transliteration", "Translation"]}
  rows={[
    ["هُوَ (he)", "عَلَّمَ", "ʿallama", "he taught"],
    ["هِيَ (she)", "عَلَّمَتْ", "ʿallamat", "she taught"],
    ["هُمْ (they m)", "عَلَّمُوا", "ʿallamū", "they (m) taught"],
    ["أَنْتَ (you m)", "عَلَّمْتَ", "ʿallamta", "you (m) taught"],
    ["أَنْتِ (you f)", "عَلَّمْتِ", "ʿallamti", "you (f) taught"],
    ["أَنَا (I)", "عَلَّمْتُ", "ʿallamtu", "I taught"],
    ["نَحْنُ (we)", "عَلَّمْنَا", "ʿallamnā", "we taught"],
    ["أَنْتُمْ (you pl)", "عَلَّمْتُمْ", "ʿallamtum", "you (pl) taught"]
  ]}
/>

**Key observations:**

1. **The stem عَلَّمْ remains constant** — the doubled ل (with shadda) never changes
2. **Suffixes are identical to Form I** — تَ، تِ، تُ، نَا، تُمْ، etc.
3. **Conjugation pattern:** عَلَّمْ + suffix

**Present tense stem:** The present tense uses يُفَعِّلُ pattern (with damma and kasra):
- يُعَلِّمُ (yuʿallimu) "he teaches"
- تُعَلِّمُ (tuʿallimu) "she teaches"
- نُعَلِّمُ (nuʿallimu) "we teach"

**Note:** Full conjugation (all 14 persons, dual forms) follows the same pattern. See [L3.03](/learn/level-3/past-tense) for complete suffix system.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Form II: The Doubled-Middle Pattern">

**Form II** (فَعَّلَ / faʿʿala) is characterized by:

### Pattern Structure

**Past tense:** فَعَّلَ (CaCCaCa) — middle root letter is DOUBLED (marked with shadda ـّ)

**Template application:**
- Root ع-ل-م + Form II pattern فَعَّلَ = عَلَّمَ "he taught"
- Root ك-س-ر + Form II pattern فَعَّلَ = كَسَّرَ "he shattered"

### Three Main Meanings

1. **Causative** — make someone do the Form I action
   - عَلِمَ "he knew" → عَلَّمَ "he taught (caused to know)"

2. **Intensive** — do the action intensely or repeatedly
   - كَسَرَ "he broke" → كَسَّرَ "he shattered (broke thoroughly)"

3. **Transitive** — make intransitive Form I transitive
   - قَدُسَ "it was holy" → قَدَّسَ "he sanctified (made holy)"

### Form II Identification

**✓ Check for:** Shadda (ـّ) on the MIDDLE root letter
**✓ Past pattern:** فَعَّلَ with fatha-fatha vowels
**✓ Present pattern:** يُفَعِّلُ with damma-kasra vowels

**Related lessons:**
- [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i) — Base form for comparison
- [L3.13 Verb Form V](/learn/level-3/verb-form-v) — Reflexive of Form II (تَفَعَّلَ)

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Mistake 1: Confusing Form II shadda with regular shadda**

Not every shadda marks Form II! Shadda can occur for other reasons (assimilation, doubled letters in roots).

**Test:** Remove the shadda. Does a 3-letter root remain?
- عَلَّمَ → عَلَمَ (root ع-ل-م exists) → This IS Form II ✓
- مُحَمَّد → مُحَمَد (name, not a verb form) → This is NOT a verb form

**Mistake 2: Assuming all Form II verbs are causative**

Form II has THREE meanings: causative, intensive, and transitive. Context determines which.

- عَلَّمَ — causative ("caused to know" = taught)
- كَسَّرَ — intensive ("broke thoroughly" = shattered)
- قَدَّسَ — transitive ("made holy" = sanctified)

Don't automatically translate every Form II as "caused to..." — check the context.

**Mistake 3: Missing the shadda in reading**

The shadda (ـّ) is ESSENTIAL for meaning. Missing it changes the form entirely:

- عَلَمَ (ʿalama) — "he knew" (Form I, if such a form existed from this root)
- عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "he taught" (Form II)

Always look carefully for the shadda mark when identifying verb forms.

**Mistake 4: Thinking the doubled letter is part of the root**

The root is ALWAYS three letters (typically). The doubling is PATTERN, not root.

- Root: ع-ل-م (three letters)
- Form I pattern: فَعِلَ → عَلِمَ (three letters visible)
- Form II pattern: فَعَّلَ → عَلَّمَ (middle letter appears twice, but root is still ع-ل-م)

When extracting the root, count the UNIQUE consonants, not the shadda doubling.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify which of these verbs is Form II. Explain your reasoning for each: (a) كَتَبَ (kataba), (b) كَسَّرَ (kassara), (c) نَزَلَ (nazala), (d) عَلَّمَ (ʿallama)">

**Answer:**

**(a) كَتَبَ (kataba) — ✗ NOT Form II**

**Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"

**Analysis:**
- No shadda on any letter
- Pattern: فَعَلَ (CaCaCa) — Form I
- Meaning: "he wrote" (simple action)

**Conclusion:** This is Form I, the base form.

**(b) كَسَّرَ (kassara) — ✓ Form II**

**Root:** ك-س-ر (k-s-r) "breaking"

**Analysis:**
- Shadda (ـّ) on middle root letter س
- Pattern: فَعَّلَ (CaCCaCa) — Form II
- Semantic shift: Form I كَسَرَ "he broke" → Form II كَسَّرَ "he shattered"
- Meaning type: Intensive (broke thoroughly)

**Conclusion:** This IS Form II. The doubled س intensifies the breaking action.

**(c) نَزَلَ (nazala) — ✗ NOT Form II**

**Root:** ن-ز-ل (n-z-l) "descending"

**Analysis:**
- No shadda
- Pattern: فَعَلَ (CaCaCa) — Form I
- Meaning: "he descended" (simple motion)

**Conclusion:** This is Form I. Form II from this root would be نَزَّلَ (nazzala) "he sent down."

**(d) عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — ✓ Form II**

**Root:** ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"

**Analysis:**
- Shadda (ـّ) on middle root letter ل
- Pattern: فَعَّلَ (CaCCaCa) — Form II
- Semantic shift: Form I عَلِمَ "he knew" → Form II عَلَّمَ "he taught"
- Meaning type: Causative (caused to know)

**Conclusion:** This IS Form II. The doubled ل transforms knowing into teaching.

**Summary:** (b) كَسَّرَ and (d) عَلَّمَ are Form II. The others are Form I.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Form I نَزَلَ means 'he descended.' What does Form II نَزَّلَ mean? Explain the semantic shift and identify which of the three Form II meanings applies.">

**Answer:**

**Form II meaning:** نَزَّلَ (nazzala) — "he sent down, he revealed"

**Semantic shift:**
- **Form I:** نَزَلَ (nazala) — "he descended" (intransitive, motion by itself)
- **Form II:** نَزَّلَ (nazzala) — "he sent down" (transitive, caused descent)

**Type of Form II meaning:** **Causative**

Form II takes the simple descent of Form I and makes it causative — the subject CAUSES something else to descend. Allah نَزَّلَ the Quran means He SENT DOWN the Quran — He caused it to descend to the Prophet ﷺ.

**Additional semantic note:** Form II نَزَّلَ can also have **intensive** meaning: "he sent down repeatedly, revealed gradually." The Quran uses both أَنزَلَ (Form IV, one-time revelation) and نَزَّلَ (Form II, gradual revelation over time).

**Quranic usage:**
- نَزَّلَ often emphasizes the PROCESS of revelation (gradual descent)
- أَنزَلَ (Form IV) often emphasizes the ACT of revelation (sending down)

Both are causative, but Form II adds the nuance of gradual or repeated action.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Identify the Form II verb in this verse from Al-Baqarah: 'وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا' [Al-Baqarah 2:31]. Extract the root, explain the Form II marker, and describe the meaning shift from Form I.">

**Answer:**

**Form II verb:** عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "He taught"

**Root extraction:**
- Remove past tense subject marker (3rd masc sing = no suffix)
- Identify three root consonants: ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m)
- Root meaning: "knowledge, knowing"

**Form II marker:**
- Shadda (ـّ) on the middle root letter ل
- This doubling is THE distinctive marker of Form II
- Written: عَلَّمَ (the ل appears doubled)
- Pattern: فَعَّلَ (CaCCaCa)

**Semantic shift from Form I:**

| Form | Verb | Pattern | Meaning | Type |
|------|------|---------|---------|------|
| Form I | عَلِمَ | فَعِلَ | "he knew" | Simple knowledge (state) |
| Form II | عَلَّمَ | فَعَّلَ | "he taught" | Causative knowledge (action) |

**Meaning transformation:** Form I عَلِمَ is PASSIVE knowledge — someone has knowledge. Form II عَلَّمَ is ACTIVE causation — someone MAKES another person have knowledge. Teaching is causing knowing.

**Full verse analysis:**
- **وَعَلَّمَ** (wa-ʿallama): "And He taught" — Form II causative
- **آدَمَ** (ādama): "Adam" — direct object (mafʿūl bihi), accusative case
- **ٱلْأَسْمَاءَ** (al-asmāʾa): "the names" — second object (some verbs take two), accusative
- **كُلَّهَا** (kullahā): "all of them" — emphasis, accusative

Allah didn't just make Adam know — He actively TAUGHT Adam. Form II captures this causative action perfectly.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Given root ق-د-س (q-d-s) meaning 'holy, sacred', predict what Form II قَدَّسَ (qaddasa) might mean. Which of the three Form II meanings would apply, and why?">

**Answer:**

**Prediction:** قَدَّسَ (qaddasa) — "he sanctified, he made holy"

**Reasoning:**

**Root analysis:**
- Root: ق-د-س (q-d-s) "holiness, sacredness"
- Form I (if it exists): قَدُسَ (qadusa) — "it was holy" (adjective-like, intransitive)

**Form II meaning type:** **Transitive** (possibly also causative)

Here's why: Form I قَدُسَ is an intransitive state — something IS holy by itself, no object needed. Form II قَدَّسَ makes it transitive — someone MAKES something holy, which requires an object.

**Transformation:**
- Form I: "X was holy" (no action, no object)
- Form II: "Y sanctified X" (action with object)

**Quranic verification:**

The root ق-د-س appears in the Quran in various forms:
- قُدْسٌ (quds) — "holiness" (noun)
- قُدُّوس (quddūs) — "The Most Holy" (divine name, intensive pattern)
- قَدَّسَ — used in expressions like سُبْحَانَكَ وَبِحَمْدِكَ meaning sanctification

**Semantic formula:**
قَدُسَ (state of holiness) + Form II doubling → قَدَّسَ (action of making holy)

**Related word family:**
- مُقَدَّس (muqaddas) — "sanctified, holy" (Form II passive participle)
- تَقْدِيسٌ (taqdīs) — "sanctification" (Form II verbal noun)

This demonstrates the TRANSITIVE function of Form II: taking an intransitive quality and making it an action that requires an object.
