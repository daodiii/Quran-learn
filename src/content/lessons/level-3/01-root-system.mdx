## Introduction

Welcome to Level 3! You've mastered how Arabic sentences work — how nouns and verbs relate to each other through case endings. Now you're ready to discover how the WORDS THEMSELVES are built.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابٌُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ"
  transliteration="dhālika l-kitābu lā rayba fīhi"
  translation="That is the Book; in it is no doubt"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:2"
  highlight="ٱلْكِتَابٌُ"
/>

The word **ٱلْكِتَابٌُ** (al-kitābu) "the Book" comes from a three-letter [root](/resources/glossary/#jadhr) (jadhr / جَذْرٌ): **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b), which carries the core meaning of "writing." From these same three letters come dozens of related words: كَاتِبٌ (kātibun) "writer," مَكْتُوبٌ (maktūbun) "written," مَكْتَبٌ (maktabun) "desk/office," and many more.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand the concept of [trilateral](/resources/glossary/#thulathi) (three-letter) roots as the foundation of Arabic words
- Recognize how words are derived from root letters using [patterns](/resources/glossary/#wazn)
- Extract roots from Quranic words for dictionary lookup
- Master the practical skill of root-based vocabulary expansion

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L1.06 Three Word Types](/learn/level-1/06-three-word-types/), you learned that Arabic has nouns, verbs, and particles. Now you'll discover that nouns and verbs are built from the same building blocks — roots and patterns. This is Arabic morphology (ṣarf / صَرْفٌ), the science of how words are formed.

**Key Level 3 transition:** Level 2 taught you SENTENCE GRAMMAR (nahw / نَحْوٌ) — how words relate to each other. Level 3 teaches you WORD MORPHOLOGY (ṣarf / صَرْفٌ) — how words are built internally. Mastering both nahw and ṣarf is the path to deep Quranic understanding.

## Understanding the Root System

**Plain English first:** Arabic words are built like LEGO bricks. Every word has two components:

1. **Root letters** — the basic building blocks (3 consonants carrying core meaning)
2. **Pattern** — the blueprint or template (vowels and extra letters showing word type)

Different blueprints using the same bricks create different words with related meanings. Once you recognize the root, you unlock an entire family of words.

### The LEGO Brick Analogy

Imagine you have three LEGO bricks colored red, blue, and green. Now imagine you have different instruction blueprints:

- **Blueprint A:** Stack them vertically → you get a tower
- **Blueprint B:** Arrange them horizontally → you get a wall
- **Blueprint C:** Connect them in an L-shape → you get a corner

Same three bricks, different arrangements, different results — but all related because they use the same bricks.

Arabic works exactly this way:

- **Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) — three consonants meaning "writing" (your LEGO bricks)
- **Pattern 1:** فَعَلَ (CaCaCa) → كَتَبَ (kataba) "he wrote" — past tense verb
- **Pattern 2:** فَاعِلٌٌ (CāCiC) → كَاتِبٌ (kātibun) "writer" — active participle
- **Pattern 3:** مَفْعُولٌٌ (maCCūC) → مَكْتُوبٌ (maktūbun) "written" — passive participle
- **Pattern 4:** مَفْعَلٌ (maCCaC) → مَكْتَبٌ (maktabun) "desk/office" — place noun

Same root letters (ك-ت-ب), different patterns, different meanings — but all connected to "writing"!

### Arabic Terminology

**Root** — [jadhr](/resources/glossary/#jadhr) (جَذْرٌ), also called [radical letters](/resources/glossary/#huruf-al-jadhr) (ḥurūf al-jadhr / حُرُوفُ ٱلْجَذْرِ)

The root is a group of 3 consonants (sometimes 4) that carry the core semantic meaning. By applying different vowel patterns and adding letters, you create a whole FAMILY of related words.

**Pattern** — [wazn](/resources/glossary/#wazn) (wazn / وَزْنٌ)

The pattern is the template or mold that shapes the root into a specific word type. Patterns use the template letters **ف-ع-ل** (f-ʿ-l) to represent the three root positions:

- **ف** (fāʾ al-fiʿl) represents the FIRST root letter
- **ع** (ʿayn al-fiʿl) represents the SECOND root letter
- **ل** (lām al-fiʿl) represents the THIRD root letter

When you see the pattern فَعَلَ (faʿala), it means: "take your three root letters and arrange them with fatha-sukūn-fatha vowels."

### Trilateral vs Quadrilateral Roots

**[Trilateral roots](/resources/glossary/#thulathi)** (thulāthī / ثُلَاثِيٌّ) — three-letter roots

The vast majority (80%+) of Arabic roots have exactly three consonants:
- ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"
- ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
- ح-م-د (ḥ-m-d) "praise"
- ق-ر-ء (q-r-ʾ) "reading/recitation"

**[Quadrilateral roots](/resources/glossary/#rubai)** (rubāʿī / رُبَاعِيٌّ) — four-letter roots

Some roots have four consonants (less common):
- د-ح-ر-ج (d-ḥ-r-j) "rolling"
- ز-ل-ز-ل (z-l-z-l) "earthquake/shaking"
- و-س-و-س (w-s-w-s) "whispering"

For this lesson, we'll focus on trilateral roots, as they form the foundation of Arabic morphology.

### The Root ك-ت-ب Word Family

Let's explore one complete word family to see how roots and patterns work together:

<GrammarTable>
| Pattern | Arabic Term | Root ك-ت-ب Applied | Transliteration | Meaning | Word Type |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|-----------------|---------|-----------|
| فَعَلَ | faʿala | كَتَبَ | kataba | he wrote | Verb (past) |
| يَفْعُلُ | yafʿulu | يَكْتُبُ | yaktubu | he writes | Verb (present) |
| ٱُكْتُبْ | uktub | ٱُكْتُبْ | uktub | write! | Verb (imperative) |
| فَاعِلٌ | fāʿil | كَاتِبٌ | kātibun | writer | Active participle |
| مَفْعُولٌ | mafʿūl | مَكْتُوبٌ | maktūbun | written | Passive participle |
| فِعَالٌ | fiʿāl | كِتَابٌٌ | kitābun | book | Verbal noun |
| مَفْعَل | mafʿal | مَكْتَبٌ | maktabun | desk/office | Noun of place |
| مَفْعَلَة | mafʿalah | مَكْتَبَةٌ | maktabatun | library | Noun of place (fem.) |
| كِتَابٌَةٌ | kitābah | كِتَابٌَةٌٌ | kitābatun | writing (act of) | Verbal noun |
</GrammarTable>

**The key insight:** ALL of these words share the three root consonants ك-ت-ب in the same order. The vowels, prefixes, and suffixes change, but the root remains constant like a skeleton supporting different bodies.

Once you know the root ك-ت-ب means "writing," you can recognize and understand dozens of related words — even if you've never seen them before!

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine words from Surah Al-Baqarah to see roots in action. We'll focus on the root ك-ت-ب and explore how it appears in different forms.

### Example 1: The Book (al-Kitāb)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابٌُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ هُدًى لِّلْمُتَّقِينَ"
  transliteration="dhālika l-kitābu lā rayba fīhi hudan li-l-muttaqīna"
  translation="That is the Book; in it is no doubt, a guidance for the righteous"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:2"
  highlight="ٱلْكِتَابٌُ"
/>

**Word focus: ٱلْكِتَابٌُ** (al-kitābu) — "the Book"

**Root extraction:**
1. Remove the definite article: ٱلْـ → leaves كِتَابٌُ
2. Strip case ending: ـُ → leaves كِتَابٌ
3. Identify the pattern: فِعَالٌ (CiCāC) with kasra-long ā-fatha
4. Extract root consonants: **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b)

**Morphological analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **ٱلْكِتَابٌُ** (al-kitābu)
  - Function: Predicate (khabar) of nominal sentence
  - Case marker: Nominative (rafʿ) with damma (ـُ)
  - Reason: Predicate takes nominative case
  - **Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"
  - **Pattern:** فِعَالٌ (fiʿāl) — verbal noun pattern
  - **Form:** Definite noun with ٱلْ prefix
  - **Meaning:** The collected writing → "the Book" (referring to the Quran)

### Example 2: It Was Written/Decreed (kutiba)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا۟ كُتِبَ عَلَيْكُمُ ٱلصِّيَامُ"
  transliteration="yā ayyuhā lladhīna āmanū kutiba ʿalaykumu ṣ-ṣiyāmu"
  translation="O you who have believed, fasting has been prescribed upon you"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:183"
  highlight="كُتِبَ"
/>

**Word focus: كُتِبَ** (kutiba) — "it was written/prescribed"

**Root extraction:**
1. Recognize passive voice pattern: فُعِلَ (CuCiCa) with damma-kasra
2. Extract root consonants: **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b)

**Morphological analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **كُتِبَ** (kutiba)
  - Function: Verb (passive voice, past tense)
  - Case: Verbs don't take case endings
  - Reason: Main verb of sentence
  - **Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"
  - **Pattern:** فُعِلَ (fuʿila) — passive past tense, Form I
  - **Form:** Passive verb (no explicit subject visible)
  - **Meaning:** "it was written" → "it was prescribed/decreed"

**Theological insight through morphology:** The passive voice emphasizes that fasting was prescribed BY ALLAH — the doer is understood from context but grammatically backgrounded, focusing attention on the obligation itself.

### Example 3: The Root ع-ل-م (Knowledge)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَعَلَّمَ ءَادَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَآءَ كُلَّهَا"
  transliteration="wa ʿallama ādama l-asmāʾa kullahā"
  translation="And He taught Adam the names, all of them"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:31"
  highlight="عَلَّمَ"
/>

**Word focus: عَلَّمَ** (ʿallama) — "he taught"

**Root extraction:**
1. Notice the doubled middle letter: عَلَّمَ
2. Pattern recognition: فَعَّلَ (CaCCaCa) — Form II intensive pattern
3. Extract root consonants: **ع-ل-م** (ʿ-l-m)

**Morphological analysis (iʿrāb):**

- **عَلَّمَ** (ʿallama)
  - Function: Verb (active voice, past tense)
  - Case: Verbs don't take case endings
  - Reason: Main verb of sentence
  - **Root:** ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
  - **Pattern:** فَعَّلَ (faʿʿala) — Form II (doubled middle letter)
  - **Form:** Causative/intensive verb
  - **Meaning:** Form II makes it causative: "he caused to know" → "he taught"

**Word family from root ع-ل-م:**
- عَلِمَ (ʿalima) — "he knew" (Form I)
- عَالِمٌ (ʿālimun) — "scholar/knowledgeable one"
- عِلْمٌ (ʿilmun) — "knowledge"
- مَعْلُومٌ (maʿlūmun) — "known"
- مُعَلِّمٌ (muʿallimun) — "teacher"

### Example 4: Complete Verse Analysis

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱللَّهُ بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ عَلِيمٌ"
  transliteration="wa llāhu bi-kulli shayʾin ʿalīmun"
  translation="And Allah is Knowing of all things"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:231"
  highlight="عَلِيمٌ"
/>

**Word-by-word morphological breakdown:**

1. **وَ** (wa) — PARTICLE
   - Function: Coordinating conjunction
   - Meaning: "and"

2. **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu) — NOUN
   - Function: Subject (mubtadaʾ) of nominal sentence
   - Case marker: Nominative with damma (ـُ)
   - Reason: Subject takes nominative case
   - **Root:** ا-ل-ه (hamza-lam-ha) related to "divinity"
   - **Form:** Proper noun (divine name)

3. **بِ** (bi) — PARTICLE
   - Function: Preposition meaning "with/about/concerning"
   - Triggers genitive case on following word

4. **كُلِّ** (kulli) — NOUN
   - Function: Object of preposition (inside prepositional phrase)
   - Case marker: Genitive with kasra (ـِ)
   - Reason: Prepositions trigger genitive
   - **Root:** ك-ل-ل (k-l-l) "totality"

5. **شَىْءٍ** (shayʾin) — NOUN
   - Function: Second part of possessive construction (muḍāf ilayhi)
   - Case marker: Genitive with kasratain (ـٍ)
   - Reason: Second noun in iḍāfah takes genitive
   - **Root:** ش-ي-ء (sh-y-ʾ) "thing/something"

6. **عَلِيمٌ** (ʿalīmun) — NOUN/ADJECTIVE
   - Function: Predicate (khabar) of nominal sentence
   - Case marker: Nominative with dammatain (ـٌ)
   - Reason: Predicate takes nominative case
   - **Root:** ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
   - **Pattern:** فَعِيلٌ (faʿīl) — intensive adjective pattern
   - **Form:** Intensive attribute (extremely knowledgeable)
   - **Meaning:** "All-Knowing" (one of Allah's beautiful names)

**Structural insight:** This verse is a nominal sentence (ٱللَّهُ عَلِيمٌ) with an inserted prepositional phrase (بِكُلِّ شَىْءٍ) between subject and predicate for emphasis.

## Dictionary Lookup Strategy

Understanding roots isn't just academic — it's the KEY to independent Quran study. Arabic dictionaries are organized by ROOT, not alphabetically by the word you see. This means you MUST extract the root to look up any word.

**Why root-based dictionaries?** Because organizing by roots groups all related words together. When you look up ك-ت-ب, you find كَاتِبٌ (writer), مَكْتُوبٌ (written), كِتَابٌٌ (book), مَكْتَبٌ (desk), and dozens more — all in one place!

<Callout type="rule" title="Root Extraction and Dictionary Lookup Process">

Follow these steps to extract roots and use an Arabic dictionary:

**Step 1: Remove all prefixes**
- Definite article: ٱلْـ, الْـ
- Prepositions: بِـ, لِـ, كَـ, وَ
- Verbal prefixes: أَ, تَ, يَ, نَ

**Step 2: Remove all suffixes**
- Case endings: ـُ, ـَ, ـِ, ـٌ, ـً, ـٍ
- Pronoun suffixes: ـهُ, ـكَ, ـنَا, ـهُمْ, etc.
- Plural/dual endings: ـُونَ, ـِينَ, ـَانِ, ـَيْنِ, ـَاتٍ

**Step 3: Identify pattern letters vs root letters**

Pattern letters (additions to the root):
- م prefix in مَفْعُولٌ patterns (مَكْتُوبٌ → root is ك-ت-ب, not م-ك-ت-ب)
- ت prefix in Form V/VI verbs (تَعَلَّمَ → root is ع-ل-م)
- اِ prefix and نْ infix in Form VII (اِنْكَسَرَ → root is ك-س-ر)
- Doubled letters (عَلَّمَ has doubled ل, root is ع-ل-م not ع-ل-ل)
- Long vowels inserted between root letters (قَاتَلَ → root is ق-ت-ل)

**Step 4: Extract the 3 (or 4) root consonants**

Read through the word and pick out the consonants that remain after removing prefixes, suffixes, and pattern additions.

**Step 5: Look up the root in the dictionary**

Arabic dictionaries list roots alphabetically:
- First by first root letter (ك before ع before ق)
- Then by second root letter (ك-ت-ب before ك-ف-ر)
- Then by third root letter (ك-ت-ب before ك-ت-م)

</Callout>

### Worked Example 1: مَكْتَبَةٌ (Library)

Let's extract the root from **مَكْتَبَةٌ** (maktabatun) "library" step by step.

**Step 1: Remove prefixes**
- No ٱلْ prefix
- No preposition prefix
- Word: مَكْتَبَةٌ

**Step 2: Remove suffixes**
- Remove case ending ـٌ → مَكْتَبَة
- Remove feminine marker ـة → مَكْتَب

**Step 3: Identify pattern vs root letters**
- Pattern: مَفْعَل (mafʿal) — noun of place pattern
- The **م** prefix is part of the PATTERN, not the root
- The root consonants come after the م

**Step 4: Extract root consonants**
- Remaining consonants: ك - ت - ب
- Root: **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b)

**Step 5: Dictionary lookup**
- Look under root ك-ت-ب
- Core meaning: "writing"
- Pattern مَفْعَلَة (mafʿalah) = place of action (feminine)
- Word meaning: "place of writing" → **library**

**Understanding:** Once you know the root ك-ت-ب means "writing" and the pattern مَفْعَلَة means "place where the action happens," you can DEDUCE the meaning "library" even if you've never seen this word before!

### Worked Example 2: مُسْلِمُونَ (Muslims)

Let's extract the root from **مُسْلِمُونَ** (muslimūna) "Muslims" (plural, nominative).

**Step 1: Remove prefixes**
- No definite article
- No preposition
- Word: مُسْلِمُونَ

**Step 2: Remove suffixes**
- Plural masculine sound ending ـُونَ → مُسْلِم

**Step 3: Identify pattern vs root letters**
- Pattern: مُفْعِل (mufʿil) — active participle Form IV
- The **م** prefix is part of the PATTERN (Form IV adds م prefix)
- Remaining letters after removing pattern prefix: س - ل - م

**Step 4: Extract root consonants**
- Root: **س-ل-م** (s-l-m)

**Step 5: Dictionary lookup**
- Look under root س-ل-م
- Core meaning: "safety, peace, submission"
- Pattern مُفْعِل from Form IV = doer of causative action
- Form IV أَسْلَمَ (aslama) = "he submitted/surrendered (to Allah)"
- Active participle مُسْلِمٌ = "one who submits" → **Muslim**

**Theological precision:** The word "Muslim" literally means "one who submits (to Allah)" — this meaning is locked into the ROOT س-ل-م. Related words from the same root:
- سَلَامٌ (salāmun) — "peace"
- سَلَّمَ (sallama) — "he greeted, made peace"
- إِسْلَامٌ (islāmun) — "submission" (the religion)
- مُسَالَمَةٌ (musālamatun) — "making peace"

All connected through the root س-ل-م!

### Common Mistakes in Root Extraction

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Root Extraction Errors">

**Mistake 1: Counting pattern letters as root letters**

❌ Wrong: مَكْتُوبٌ (maktūbun) has root م-ك-ت-ب
✓ Correct: Root is ك-ت-ب (the م is a pattern prefix in مَفْعُولٌ)

**Pattern prefixes to watch for:**
- **م** in مَفْعُولٌ, مَفْعِل, مِفْعَالٌ patterns
- **ت** in تَفَعَّلَ, تَفَاعَلَ patterns (Forms V, VI)
- **اِسْتَـ** in اِسْتَفْعَلَ pattern (Form X)
- **اِنْـ** in اِنْفَعَلَ pattern (Form VII)

**Mistake 2: Not recognizing doubled root letters**

❌ Wrong: عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) has root ع-ل-ل
✓ Correct: Root is ع-ل-م (the ل is doubled in Form II, but it's still just ONE root letter)

Form II pattern فَعَّلَ doubles the middle root letter for intensive meaning.

**Mistake 3: Including long vowels as root letters**

❌ Wrong: قَاتَلَ (qātala) has root ق-ا-ت-ل (4 letters)
✓ Correct: Root is ق-ت-ل (the long ā is inserted by Form III pattern, not part of root)

Long vowels (ا, و, ي) are often pattern additions, not root letters (though some roots DO have و or ي as actual root letters — you'll learn to distinguish these with practice).

**Mistake 4: Assuming every 3 consecutive consonants are a root**

Not every three-letter word has those three letters as its root!

Example: **فِيهِ** (fīhi) "in it"
- This is preposition فِي + pronoun suffix ـهِ
- NOT a trilateral root word at all!

**Learn to recognize:**
- Particles (not derived from roots): فِي، مِنْ، إِلَىٰ، وَ، لَا
- Pronouns (not root-derived): هُوَ، هِيَ، أَنْتَ، نَحْنُ
- Proper nouns (may not follow Arabic root patterns): مُوسَىٰ، عِيسَىٰ

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: What are the three root consonants of كَاتِبٌ (kātibun) 'writer'?">

**Answer:**

The root is **ك-ت-ب** (k-t-b).

**Extraction process:**
1. Remove case ending ـٌ → كَاتِبْ
2. Identify pattern: فَاعِلٌ (CāCiC) — active participle pattern
3. The pattern template فَاعِلٌ has a long ā vowel between first and second root letters
4. Extract consonants: **ك - ت - ب**

**Verification:** The pattern فَاعِلٌ means "doer of the action." Applied to root ك-ت-ب (writing), it produces كَاتِبٌ "one who writes" → "writer."

**Word family connection:** Once you know the root is ك-ت-ب, you can recognize all these related words:
- كَتَبَ (kataba) — "he wrote"
- كِتَابٌٌ (kitābun) — "book"
- مَكْتُوبٌ (maktūbun) — "written"
- مَكْتَبٌ (maktabun) — "office/desk"

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Which of these words comes from root ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) 'knowledge'? Select all that apply: عَلِمَ / ذَهَبَ / عَالِمٌ / كَتَبَ / مُعَلِّمٌ">

**Answer:**

Words from root ع-ل-م:
1. ✓ **عَلِمَ** (ʿalima) — "he knew"
2. ✓ **عَالِمٌ** (ʿālimun) — "scholar, knowledgeable one"
3. ✓ **مُعَلِّمٌ** (muʿallimun) — "teacher"

Words from OTHER roots:
- ✗ **ذَهَبَ** (dhahaba) — "he went" (root: ذ-ه-ب)
- ✗ **كَتَبَ** (kataba) — "he wrote" (root: ك-ت-ب)

**Analysis:**

**عَلِمَ** (ʿalima):
- Pattern: فَعِلَ (CaCiCa) — Form I past tense
- Root extraction: ع - ل - م
- Meaning: "he knew"

**عَالِمٌ** (ʿālimun):
- Pattern: فَاعِلٌ (CāCiC) — active participle
- Root extraction: ع - ا - ل - م → remove long ā (pattern vowel) → ع - ل - م
- Meaning: "knowing one" → "scholar"

**مُعَلِّمٌ** (muʿallimun):
- Pattern: مُفَعِّل (muCaCCiC) — Form II active participle
- Root extraction: م is pattern prefix, doubled ل → ع - ل - م
- Meaning: "one who causes to know" → "teacher"

**Key insight:** The root ع-ل-م connects "knowing," "scholar," and "teacher" — all related to knowledge!

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Given root ح-م-د (ḥ-m-d) 'praise', list at least 3 words you can form from this root and identify their patterns.">

**Answer:**

Words from root ح-م-د (ḥ-m-d) "praise":

1. **حَمِدَ** (ḥamida) — "he praised"
   - Pattern: فَعِلَ (CaCiCa) — Form I past tense
   - Meaning: Simple past action

2. **حَامِدٌ** (ḥāmidun) — "one who praises, praising"
   - Pattern: فَاعِلٌ (CāCiC) — active participle
   - Meaning: Doer of praise

3. **حَمْدٌ** (ḥamdun) — "praise" (the act itself)
   - Pattern: فَعْلٌ (CaCC) — verbal noun
   - Meaning: The abstract concept of praising

4. **مَحْمُودٌ** (maḥmūdun) — "praised, praiseworthy"
   - Pattern: مَفْعُولٌ (maCCūC) — passive participle
   - Meaning: Recipient of praise

5. **أَحْمَدُ** (aḥmadu) — "more praiseworthy" OR proper name "Ahmad"
   - Pattern: أَفْعَل (aCCaC) — comparative/superlative OR Form IV
   - Meaning: Most praised (also a name of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ)

6. **مُحَمَّدٌ** (muḥammadun) — "highly praised" (proper name)
   - Pattern: مُفَعَّل (muCaCCaC) — Form II passive participle
   - Meaning: Intensively praised (the Prophet's name ﷺ)

**Theological connection:** The root ح-م-د appears in the very first verse you recite in every prayer:

**ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ** (al-ḥamdu lillāhi) — "All praise belongs to Allah"

This root is fundamental to Islamic expression of gratitude and worship!

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: You encounter the word مُؤْمِنُونَ (muʾminūna) in a verse. Walk through the dictionary lookup steps to find its root and meaning.">

**Answer:**

**Word:** مُؤْمِنُونَ (muʾminūna) — appears in Al-Baqarah 2:3 وَٱلَّذِينَ يُؤْمِنُونَ

**Step 1: Remove prefixes**
- No definite article
- No attached preposition
- Word: مُؤْمِنُونَ

**Step 2: Remove suffixes**
- Plural masculine sound ending ـُونَ → مُؤْمِن

**Step 3: Identify pattern vs root**
- Pattern: مُفْعِل (muCCiC) — Form IV active participle
- The **م** prefix is part of Form IV pattern (not root)
- The **ؤ** (hamza on waw carrier) is a root letter

**Step 4: Extract root consonants**
- After removing pattern prefix م: ؤْمِنْ
- Root letters: **ء - م - ن** (hamza-mīm-nūn)

**Step 5: Dictionary lookup**
- Look under root **ء-م-ن** (ʾ-m-n)
- Core meaning: "safety, security, trust, belief"
- Form IV: أَ prefix makes it causative/declarative
- Form IV أَمَنَ (āmana) = "he believed, he had faith"
- Active participle مُؤْمِنٌ (muʾminun) = "believer, one who has faith"
- Plural: مُؤْمِنُونَ (muʾminūna) = "believers"

**Complete meaning:** "Those who believe/believers"

**Word family from root ء-م-ن:**
- أَمْنٌ (amnun) — "safety, security"
- أَمَانَةٌ (amānatun) — "trust, honesty, trustworthiness"
- أَمِينٌ (amīnun) — "trustworthy" (often used for "treasurer")
- إِيمَانٌ (īmānun) — "faith, belief" (Form IV verbal noun)
- آمَنَ (āmana) — "he believed" (Form IV)
- مُؤْمِنٌ (muʾminun) — "believer"

**Theological insight:** The root ء-م-ن connects "safety," "trust," and "belief" — faith (īmān) is fundamentally about trusting in Allah and finding security in that trust!
