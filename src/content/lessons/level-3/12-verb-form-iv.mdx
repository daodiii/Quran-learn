## Introduction

You've mastered [Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i) as the base verb pattern — three root letters with vowels, nothing added. Now you'll encounter Form IV, one of the most common augmented forms in the Quran. Form IV adds a single letter to the root: an **alif prefix** (أَ) at the beginning.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا فَهَدَىٰ ۝ وَوَجَدَكَ عَائِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā, wa-wajadaka ʿāʾilan fa-aghnā"
  translation="And He found you lost and guided [you], and He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient"
  reference="Al-Duha 93:7-8"
  highlight="فَأَغْنَىٰ"
/>

The word **فَأَغْنَىٰ** (fa-aghnā) "He made [you] self-sufficient" is Form IV, built from root غ-ن-ي (gh-n-y) meaning "wealth/richness." Notice the **أَ** prefix before the root letters. This prefix signals Form IV and transforms the root's basic meaning into a CAUSATIVE: "to make someone rich/self-sufficient."

Compare:
- **Form I:** غَنِيَ (ghaniya) "he was rich" — describing a STATE
- **Form IV:** أَغْنَىٰ (aghnā) "he made [someone] rich" — CAUSING that state

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize the Form IV pattern: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala) with alif prefix and sukūn on first root letter
- Understand Form IV's causative meaning: "to cause [someone/something] to do X"
- Identify Form IV's semantic shift: making someone ENTER the state of the root meaning
- Compare Form IV with Form II (both causative but different patterns)
- Conjugate Form IV verbs across representative persons
- Spot Form IV verbs in Quranic text by pattern recognition

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you learned that Form I is the "bare" (mujarrad) verb pattern. In [L3.10 Verb Form II](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii), you saw how doubling the middle letter creates intensification or causation. Form IV is another method of creating causation — but with a different pattern and often different semantic nuance.

**Forward connection:** This lesson prepares you for [L3.15 Verb Forms VII-X](/learn/level-3/verb-forms-vii-x), where you'll see additional augmented patterns. Form IV is crucial because it's the second most frequent augmented form in the Quran (after Form II), and many essential Quranic verbs use this pattern.

## Understanding Form IV (If'al)

**Plain English first:** Think of Form IV as adding a "starter button" to the verb. Form I describes the action happening. Form IV adds a prefix that means "to MAKE it happen" or "to CAUSE it to happen."

Imagine:
- **Form I:** The engine runs (describing the state)
- **Form IV:** You START the engine (causing the state)

Form IV adds the **أَ** prefix to signal this "causing" function.

**The pattern: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala)**

Form IV uses the template أَفْعَلَ (afʿala):
- **أَ** (alif with fatha) = prefix added BEFORE the root
- **ف** (fa with sukūn) = FIRST root letter with sukūn
- **ع** (ʿayn with fatha) = SECOND root letter with fatha
- **ل** (lam) = THIRD root letter

**Key structural features:**
1. Alif prefix (أَ) before the root
2. Sukūn (ـْ) on the first root letter
3. Fatha (ـَ) on the second root letter

### Form IV Pattern Decomposition

Let's see how Form IV is constructed step by step:

**Root: غ-ن-ي (gh-n-y) "wealth/richness"**

```
Step 1: Start with root letters
        غ - ن - ي

Step 2: Apply Form IV template (أَفْعَلَ)
        أَ + غْ + نَ + ى
        ↑   ↑   ↑   ↑
        prefix  1st  2nd  3rd
        (alif)  (sukūn) (fatha)

Step 3: Result
        أَغْنَى (aghnā) "he made [someone] rich/self-sufficient"
```

**Visual pattern:**

<GrammarTable>
| Component | Position | Letter | Vowel | Example |
|-----------|----------|--------|-------|---------|
| Prefix | Before root | أ | fatha (ـَ) | أَ |
| First root | 1st | غ | sukūn (ـْ) | غْ |
| Second root | 2nd | ن | fatha (ـَ) | نَ |
| Third root | 3rd | ي | (varies) | ى |
| **Result** | | | | **أَغْنَى** |
</GrammarTable>

### Arabic Terminology

**Form IV** — [al-fiʿl al-rubāʿī al-mazīd](/resources/glossary#fil-rubai-mazid) or simply [ifʿāl](/resources/glossary#ifal) (ifʿāl / إِفْعَالٌ)

The word إِفْعَالٌ (ifʿāl) comes from the pattern itself: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala) in the [masdar](/resources/glossary#masdar) (verbal noun) form. It's called "Form IV" in English pedagogy, but Arabic grammarians also call it "the pattern with alif at the beginning."

**Causative meaning** — [taʿdiya](/resources/glossary#tadiya) (taʿdiya / تَعْدِيَةٌ)

The grammatical term for making something "transitive" or "causative" — causing an action to affect someone else.

### Form IV Meaning: Causative

Form IV's primary function is **CAUSATION** — making someone or something enter the state or perform the action of the root meaning.

**The causative shift:**
- **Form I:** describes a state or action
- **Form IV:** causes someone/something to enter that state or do that action

<GrammarTable>
| Root | Form I (State/Action) | Form IV (Causative) |
|------|----------------------|---------------------|
| س-ل-م | سَلِمَ (salima) "he was safe/sound" | أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "he submitted [himself to God]" = made himself enter peace/safety |
| ن-ز-ل | نَزَلَ (nazala) "he descended" | أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "he sent down" = made [something] descend |
| خ-ر-ج | خَرَجَ (kharaja) "he went out" | أَخْرَجَ (akhraja) "he brought out" = made [something] go out |
| ح-س-ن | حَسُنَ (ḥasuna) "it was good/beautiful" | أَحْسَنَ (aḥsana) "he did well/beautifully" = made [action] be good |
</GrammarTable>

**Semantic pattern:** Form IV often means "to make [subject] do/be [root meaning]" or "to cause [object] to become [root meaning]."

### Form IV in Al-Duha: Examples from the Quran

Surah Al-Duha (93) contains beautiful Form IV examples showing Allah's causative actions:

**1. أَغْنَىٰ (aghnā) — "He made self-sufficient"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ عَائِلًا فَأَغْنَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ʿāʾilan fa-aghnā"
  translation="And He found you poor and made [you] self-sufficient"
  reference="Al-Duha 93:8"
  highlight="فَأَغْنَىٰ"
/>

**Root:** غ-ن-ي (gh-n-y) "wealth/richness"
**Form I:** غَنِيَ (ghaniya) "he was rich"
**Form IV:** أَغْنَىٰ (aghnā) "he made rich/self-sufficient"
**Morphological analysis:**
- Root: غ-ن-ي
- Pattern: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala)
- Form: IV
- Meaning: causative of being rich → making someone self-sufficient

**2. هَدَىٰ (hadā) — "He guided" (Form I, for comparison)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا فَهَدَىٰ"
  transliteration="wa-wajadaka ḍāllan fa-hadā"
  translation="And He found you lost and guided [you]"
  reference="Al-Duha 93:7"
  highlight="فَهَدَىٰ"
/>

Wait — this looks similar! **هَدَىٰ** (hadā) is actually Form I from root ه-د-ي, but Form I of this root already has causative meaning built into the root itself. Some roots have inherent causative meaning in Form I, so they don't need Form IV.

**Morphological analysis:**
- Root: ه-د-ي
- Pattern: فَعَلَ (faʿala)
- Form: I (defective verb with final weak letter)
- Meaning: to guide (inherently causative in Form I)

<Callout type="rule" title="Not all Form I → Form IV shifts are possible">
Not every Form I verb has a Form IV counterpart. Some roots express causation already in Form I (like ه-د-ي "to guide"), while others never appear in Form IV. You must learn which roots use which forms through exposure to the language and dictionary consultation.
</Callout>

**3. أَنْزَلَ (anzala) — "He sent down" (common Form IV in the Quran)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا أَنْزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ ٱلْقَدْرِ"
  transliteration="innā anzalnāhu fī laylati l-qadri"
  translation="Indeed, We sent it down during the Night of Decree"
  reference="Al-Qadr 97:1"
  highlight="أَنْزَلْنَاهُ"
/>

**Root:** ن-ز-ل (n-z-l) "descending/going down"
**Form I:** نَزَلَ (nazala) "he descended" (intransitive)
**Form IV:** أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "he sent down" (transitive causative)

Notice the **نَا** suffix and **هُ** suffix added to the Form IV pattern: أَنْزَلْـنَـاهُ (anzal-nā-hu) "We sent it down" — this shows Form IV can take subject and object pronouns like any other verb.

**Morphological analysis:**
- Root: ن-ز-ل
- Pattern: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala)
- Form: IV
- Subject pronoun: نَا (nā) "we"
- Object pronoun: هُ (hu) "it/him"
- Meaning: We caused [the Quran] to descend

### More Form IV Examples Across Quranic Roots

<GrammarTable>
| Root | Meaning | Form I | Form IV | Translation |
|------|---------|--------|---------|-------------|
| س-ل-م | peace/safety | سَلِمَ (salima) "was safe" | أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "submitted/surrendered" |
| ق-ب-ل | accepting | قَبِلَ (qabila) "accepted" | أَقْبَلَ (aqbala) "approached/advanced" |
| ظ-ل-م | wronging | ظَلَمَ (ẓalama) "wronged" | أَظْلَمَ (aẓlama) "became dark" |
| ح-ي-ي | life | حَيِيَ (ḥayiya) "lived" | أَحْيَا (aḥyā) "gave life/revived" |
</GrammarTable>

**Pattern observation:** Form IV works with different root types:
- Strong roots (all consonants): أَنْزَلَ (anzala)
- Hollow roots (middle weak): أَقَامَ (aqāma) from ق-و-م
- Defective roots (final weak): أَغْنَىٰ (aghnā) from غ-ن-ي
- Hamzated roots: أَمَرَ (amara) from أ-م-ر

The Form IV pattern adapts to accommodate weak root letters, but the alif prefix and sukūn on the first root letter remain constant.

## Form IV vs Form II: Causative Comparison

Both Form II and Form IV can express causation, but they have different patterns and sometimes different nuances.

<GrammarTable>
| Feature | Form II (فَعَّلَ) | Form IV (أَفْعَلَ) |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Pattern** | Doubled middle letter | Alif prefix + sukūn on 1st letter |
| **Causation type** | Intensive/repetitive causation | Simple causation |
| **Example root** | ع-ل-م (knowledge) | ن-ز-ل (descending) |
| **Form II** | عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) "he taught" (intensive: caused to know thoroughly) | — |
| **Form IV** | — | أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "he sent down" (simple: caused to descend) |
| **Frequency** | Very common in Quran | Common in Quran |
</GrammarTable>

**When the same root uses both Form II and Form IV:**

Some roots can appear in BOTH Form II and Form IV, with subtle meaning differences:

- **Root ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r) "help/victory"**
  - Form II: نَصَّرَ (naṣṣara) "he helped greatly/repeatedly" (intensive)
  - Form IV: أَنْصَرَ (anṣara) "he gave victory to" (simple causative)

- **Root خ-ب-ر (kh-b-r) "news/information"**
  - Form II: خَبَّرَ (khabbara) "he informed thoroughly/repeatedly"
  - Form IV: أَخْبَرَ (akhbara) "he informed/told" (simple causative)

**General tendency:**
- **Form II:** More intensive, repetitive, or thorough causation
- **Form IV:** More direct, simple causation

But this is a tendency, not an absolute rule. Many roots appear in only one of these forms, not both.

<Callout type="insight" title="Why two causative forms?">
Arabic's richness allows multiple ways to express causation with different shades of meaning. Form II often emphasizes the INTENSITY or REPETITION of the causing action, while Form IV emphasizes the DIRECTNESS of causing something to happen. This distinction is subtle and context-dependent — exposure to Quranic usage is the best way to develop intuition.

## Form IV Conjugation

Form IV conjugates like other verbs, with the alif prefix maintained throughout conjugation and adjustments for subject pronouns.

**Past tense conjugation of أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "he submitted":**

<VerbConjugation
  verb="أَسْلَمَ"
  root="س-ل-م"
  form="IV"
  tense="past"
  persons={[
    { person: "he", arabic: "أَسْلَمَ", transliteration: "aslama" },
    { person: "she", arabic: "أَسْلَمَتْ", transliteration: "aslamat" },
    { person: "you (m.s.)", arabic: "أَسْلَمْتَ", transliteration: "aslamta" },
    { person: "you (f.s.)", arabic: "أَسْلَمْتِ", transliteration: "aslamti" },
    { person: "I", arabic: "أَسْلَمْتُ", transliteration: "aslamtu" },
    { person: "they (m.)", arabic: "أَسْلَمُوا۟", transliteration: "aslamū" },
    { person: "they (f.)", arabic: "أَسْلَمْنَ", transliteration: "aslamna" },
    { person: "we", arabic: "أَسْلَمْنَا", transliteration: "aslamnā" }
  ]}
/>

**Pattern observation:**
- The **أَ** prefix remains constant across all persons
- The root letters **س-ل-م** remain in sequence
- Subject pronouns attach as suffixes (ـَ, ـَتْ, ـْتَ, ـْتِ, ـْتُ, ـُوا, ـْنَ, ـْنَا)
- Vowel on the second root letter (ـَ) may change based on subject

**Present tense conjugation of يُسْلِمُ (yuslimu) "he submits":**

<VerbConjugation
  verb="يُسْلِمُ"
  root="س-ل-م"
  form="IV"
  tense="present"
  persons={[
    { person: "he", arabic: "يُسْلِمُ", transliteration: "yuslimu" },
    { person: "she", arabic: "تُسْلِمُ", transliteration: "tuslimu" },
    { person: "you (m.s.)", arabic: "تُسْلِمُ", transliteration: "tuslimu" },
    { person: "you (f.s.)", arabic: "تُسْلِمِينَ", transliteration: "tuslimīna" },
    { person: "I", arabic: "أُسْلِمُ", transliteration: "uslimu" },
    { person: "they (m.)", arabic: "يُسْلِمُونَ", transliteration: "yuslimūna" },
    { person: "they (f.)", arabic: "يُسْلِمْنَ", transliteration: "yuslimna" },
    { person: "we", arabic: "نُسْلِمُ", transliteration: "nuslimu" }
  ]}
/>

**Pattern observation:**
- Present tense drops the alif prefix
- First root letter gets sukūn (ـْ): **سْ**
- Second root letter gets kasra (ـِ): **لِ**
- Subject prefix added (يُـ, تُـ, أُـ, نُـ) with damma
- Present tense pattern: يُفْعِلُ (yufʿilu) for Form IV

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IV present tense vowel pattern">
Form IV present tense always uses **damma (ـُ)** on the prefix and **kasra (ـِ)** on the second root letter: يُفْعِلُ (yufʿilu). This is consistent across all Form IV verbs, unlike Form I which has three different vowel classes.
</Callout>

## Identifying Form IV in Quranic Text

**Recognition checklist:**

1. **Count total letters:** Should be 4 letters (root + prefix) for basic Form IV
2. **Check for alif (أَ) at the beginning** (past tense) or **damma on prefix** (present tense)
3. **Check first root letter:** Should have sukūn (ـْ)
4. **Verify it's causative meaning:** Does it mean "to cause [something] to happen"?

**Examples for practice:**

<GrammarTable>
| Quranic Word | Root | Form | Translation | Verification |
|--------------|------|------|-------------|--------------|
| أَنْزَلَ | ن-ز-ل | IV | he sent down | ✓ Alif prefix, sukūn on ن, causative meaning |
| أَغْنَىٰ | غ-ن-ي | IV | he made self-sufficient | ✓ Alif prefix, sukūn on غ, causative meaning |
| أَسْلَمُوا | س-ل-م | IV | they submitted | ✓ Alif prefix, sukūn on س, ـُوا subject suffix |
| أَخْرَجَ | خ-ر-ج | IV | he brought out | ✓ Alif prefix, sukūn on خ, causative meaning |
| أَحْسَنَ | ح-س-ن | IV | he did beautifully | ✓ Alif prefix, sukūn on ح, causative meaning |
</GrammarTable>

**Common pitfalls:**

- **أَمَرَ (amara) "he commanded"** — Looks like Form IV, but the root is **أ-م-ر** (the alif is part of the root, not a Form IV prefix). This is actually Form I with a hamza root letter.
- **أَكَلَ (akala) "he ate"** — Root is أ-ك-ل (alif is root letter). This is Form I, not Form IV.
- **أَخَذَ (akhadha) "he took"** — Root is أ-خ-ذ (alif is root letter). This is Form I, not Form IV.

**How to distinguish:** Check if removing the initial alif leaves a meaningful three-letter root that exists in Form I. If the root WITHOUT the alif doesn't make sense, then the alif is likely part of the root itself (Form I with hamza root), not a Form IV prefix.

## Common Form IV Verbs in the Quran

Form IV appears frequently in the Quran with specific roots. Learning these common Form IV verbs will help you recognize the pattern instantly when reading Quranic text.

### High-Frequency Form IV Verbs

<GrammarTable>
| Form IV Verb | Root | Meaning | Frequency Note |
|--------------|------|---------|----------------|
| أَنْزَلَ (anzala) | ن-ز-ل | he sent down | 293 occurrences — most common Form IV in Quran |
| أَسْلَمَ (aslama) | س-ل-م | he submitted/surrendered | 24 occurrences — theological key term |
| أَخْرَجَ (akhraja) | خ-ر-ج | he brought out/expelled | 60+ occurrences |
| أَعْطَىٰ (aʿṭā) | ع-ط-ي | he gave/granted | 37 occurrences |
| أَحْسَنَ (aḥsana) | ح-س-ن | he did beautifully/well | 120+ occurrences |
| أَرْسَلَ (arsala) | ر-س-ل | he sent (messengers) | 500+ occurrences |
| أَحَلَّ (aḥalla) | ح-ل-ل | he made lawful | 20+ occurrences |
| أَحْيَا (aḥyā) | ح-ي-ي | he gave life/revived | 40+ occurrences |
</GrammarTable>

**Strategic learning note:** Memorizing these eight verbs gives you recognition of the majority of Form IV instances in the Quran. Most Form IV verbs in the Quran come from these roots or closely related semantic families.

### Semantic Categories of Form IV

Form IV verbs in the Quran cluster around specific semantic themes:

**1. Divine actions (Allah as subject):**
- أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "He sent down" — revelation, rain, blessings
- أَحْيَا (aḥyā) "He gave life" — resurrection, revival
- أَمَاتَ (amāta) "He caused to die" — death as divine decree
- أَعْطَىٰ (aʿṭā) "He gave" — divine gifts, provisions

**2. Human religious actions:**
- أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "he submitted" — entering Islam
- أَحْسَنَ (aḥsana) "he did beautifully" — excellence in worship
- أَقَامَ (aqāma) "he established" — prayer, justice
- آمَنَ (āmana) "he believed" — faith

**3. Physical causation:**
- أَخْرَجَ (akhraja) "he brought out" — expulsion, extraction
- أَدْخَلَ (adkhala) "he entered/admitted" — entry, inclusion
- أَرْسَلَ (arsala) "he sent" — messengers, messages

**4. Communication:**
- أَعْلَمَ (aʿlama) "he informed" — notification
- أَخْبَرَ (akhbara) "he told" — news, information

This semantic clustering helps you predict meaning when encountering unfamiliar Form IV verbs.

### Form IV Imperative (Command Form)

The imperative of Form IV drops the alif prefix and uses a different pattern:

**Pattern: أَفْعِلْ (afʿil)**

<GrammarTable>
| Past (he) | Present (he) | Imperative (you m.s.) | Translation |
|-----------|--------------|----------------------|-------------|
| أَسْلَمَ | يُسْلِمُ | أَسْلِمْ | Submit! |
| أَنْزَلَ | يُنْزِلُ | أَنْزِلْ | Send down! |
| أَخْرَجَ | يُخْرِجُ | أَخْرِجْ | Bring out! |
| أَعْطَىٰ | يُعْطِي | أَعْطِ | Give! |
</GrammarTable>

**Imperative pattern structure:**
- Hamza prefix (أَ) — NOT the same as the past tense alif
- First root letter with sukūn
- Second root letter with kasra
- Third root letter with sukūn (or appropriate ending)

Example from the Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَقِيمُوا۟ ٱلصَّلَوٰةَ وَءَاتُوا۟ ٱلزَّكَوٰةَ"
  transliteration="wa-aqīmū ṣ-ṣalāta wa-ātū z-zakāta"
  translation="And establish prayer and give zakah"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:43"
  highlight="وَأَقِيمُوا۟"
/>

**أَقِيمُوا۟** (aqīmū) is the plural masculine imperative of Form IV أَقَامَ (aqāma) "to establish." Root: ق-و-م.

### Form IV Active Participle (Ism Fa'il)

The active participle of Form IV follows the pattern **مُفْعِلٌ** (mufʿilun):

<GrammarTable>
| Form IV Verb | Active Participle | Meaning |
|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| أَسْلَمَ (aslama) | مُسْلِمٌ (muslimun) | one who submits/a Muslim |
| أَحْسَنَ (aḥsana) | مُحْسِنٌ (muḥsinun) | one who does beautifully |
| أَنْزَلَ (anzala) | مُنْزِلٌ (munzilun) | one who sends down |
| آمَنَ (āmana) | مُؤْمِنٌ (muʾminun) | one who believes/a believer |
</GrammarTable>

**Pattern observation:** The participle adds a **mīm (م)** prefix with damma, and the second root letter takes kasra — pattern **مُفْعِلٌ**.

Example from the Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ مَعَ ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ"
  transliteration="inna llāha maʿa l-muḥsinīna"
  translation="Indeed, Allah is with those who do beautifully"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:195"
  highlight="ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ"
/>

**ٱلْمُحْسِنِينَ** (al-muḥsinīna) is the plural of **مُحْسِنٌ** (muḥsinun), the Form IV active participle meaning "those who do beautifully/excellently."

**Morphological analysis:**
- Root: ح-س-ن
- Pattern: مُفْعِلِينَ (plural, accusative case)
- Form: IV active participle
- Meaning: those who cause their actions to be beautiful/excellent

<Callout type="insight" title="Participles as nouns">
Notice how Form IV participles function as NOUNS in the Quran: **مُسْلِمٌ** (muslim) and **مُؤْمِنٌ** (muʾmin) are not just "one who submits/believes" but are used as identity labels — a Muslim, a believer. This is the participle's power: it transforms a verb into a person-noun. You'll explore this more deeply in [L3.16 Active & Passive Participles](/learn/level-3/active-passive-participles).

## Summary

**Form IV (أَفْعَلَ - afʿala) key points:**

1. **Pattern structure:** Alif prefix (أَ) + first root letter with sukūn (ـْ) + second root letter with fatha (ـَ) + third root letter
2. **Primary meaning:** Causative — to cause someone/something to do or become [root meaning]
3. **Morphological recognition:** Check for alif at the beginning (past) or damma-prefixed pattern يُفْعِلُ (present)
4. **Semantic shift:** Form I (state/action) → Form IV (causing that state/action)
5. **Present tense pattern:** يُفْعِلُ (yufʿilu) with consistent damma-kasra voweling
6. **Comparison with Form II:** Both causative, but Form II often more intensive/repetitive, Form IV more direct
7. **Common in Quran:** Second most frequent augmented form after Form II

**Four key Form IV verbs from this lesson:**
- أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "he submitted" — root س-ل-م
- أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "he sent down" — root ن-ز-ل
- أَخْرَجَ (akhraja) "he brought out" — root خ-ر-ج
- أَغْنَىٰ (aghnā) "he made self-sufficient" — root غ-ن-ي

**Recognition checklist:**
1. Check for alif (أَ) prefix or damma (ـُ) on present tense prefix
2. Verify sukūn (ـْ) on first root letter
3. Confirm causative meaning: "to make/cause [X] to happen"
4. Distinguish from hamzated Form I roots (where alif is part of root, not prefix)

**Next steps:** In [L3.15 Verb Forms VII-X](/learn/level-3/verb-forms-vii-x), you'll encounter even more augmented patterns, including reflexive and reciprocal forms. Form IV provides the foundation for understanding how Arabic systematically modifies root meanings through pattern augmentation.
