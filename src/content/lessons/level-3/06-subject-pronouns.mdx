## Introduction

The opening verse of Surah Al-Ikhlas contains one of the most emphatic pronoun usages in the Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥad"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, the One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُوَ"
/>

The pronoun **هُوَ** (huwa) "He" stands out immediately. Why is it there? The sentence is a nominal sentence declaring "Allah is One." The pronoun doesn't seem necessary — we already know who the subject is from the name ٱللَّهُ (Allah). Yet the Quran explicitly includes **هُوَ**.

This is the key to understanding Arabic pronouns: they appear for EMPHASIS, not necessity. Unlike English, where pronouns are required ("I go," "he writes," "they believe"), Arabic EMBEDS pronouns into verb conjugations. When an independent pronoun appears explicitly, it's there to emphasize identity, contrast, or make the subject absolutely unmistakable.

In this surah, **هُوَ** emphasizes: "HE (and no one else) is Allah." The pronoun creates focus and weight.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Memorize all 12 independent subject pronouns (ḍamāʾir al-rafʿ)
- Understand when pronouns are explicit vs. implicit in verb conjugations
- Identify subject pronouns in Quranic verses
- Learn the three contexts where independent pronouns are necessary

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.03 Past Tense Conjugation](/learn/level-3/03-past-tense/) and [L3.04 Present Tense Conjugation](/learn/level-3/04-present-tense/), you saw suffixes and prefixes that mark WHO performs the action. Those markers ARE pronouns — they're just built into the verb. The verb كَتَبَ (kataba) already means "he wrote." The "he" is implicit. Now you'll learn the standalone, independent pronouns that can appear SEPARATELY from verbs.

**Forward connection:** This lesson prepares you for [L3.07 Attached Pronouns](/learn/level-3/07-attached-pronouns/), where you'll learn possessive and object pronouns that attach to nouns, verbs, and particles. It also sets the foundation for [L3.08 Demonstrative Pronouns](/learn/level-3/08-demonstrative-pronouns/) and [L3.09 Relative Pronouns](/learn/level-3/09-relative-pronouns/).

## Understanding Subject Pronouns

**Plain English first:** Arabic has 12 independent subject pronouns — more than English's 7 (I, you, he, she, it, we, they). Why? Because Arabic distinguishes:
1. **Masculine vs. feminine** — separate pronouns for "you (male)" and "you (female)"
2. **Singular, dual, plural** — separate pronouns for "two people" (dual)
3. **First, second, third person** — "I/we," "you," "he/she/they"

When you combine these three dimensions (gender × number × person), you get 12 unique pronouns. Each one is specific and unambiguous.

Think of English "you" — it can mean one person or many people, male or female. Arabic has FIVE different "you" pronouns: you (masculine singular), you (feminine singular), you (two people), you (males plural), you (females plural). Arabic leaves no ambiguity.

**Arabic terminology:** Subject pronouns are called [ḍamāʾir al-rafʿ](/resources/glossary/#damir-raf) (ḍamāʾir al-rafʿ / ضَمَائِرُ ٱلرَّفْعِ) — literally "pronouns of the nominative case." They're called this because they function as subjects, which take nominative case (rafʿ). Another term is [ḍamāʾir munfaṣilah](/resources/glossary/#damir-munfasil) (ḍamāʾir munfaṣilah / ضَمَائِرُ مُنْفَصِلَة) — "separate/independent pronouns" — to distinguish them from attached pronouns (ḍamāʾir muttaṣilah).

### The Complete 12-Pronoun Chart

Here are all 12 independent subject pronouns organized by person:

<GrammarTable>
| Person | Arabic | Transliteration | Translation | Gender | Number |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------------|--------|--------|
| **First Person** | أَنَا | anā | I | Common (both) | Singular |
| **First Person** | نَحْنُ | naḥnu | we | Common (both) | Plural |
| **Second Person** | أَنْتَ | anta | you (male) | Masculine | Singular |
| **Second Person** | أَنْتِ | anti | you (female) | Feminine | Singular |
| **Second Person** | أَنْتُمَا | antumā | you (two) | Common (both) | Dual |
| **Second Person** | أَنْتُمْ | antum | you (males) | Masculine | Plural |
| **Second Person** | أَنْتُنَّ | antunna | you (females) | Feminine | Plural |
| **Third Person** | هُوَ | huwa | he | Masculine | Singular |
| **Third Person** | هِيَ | hiya | she | Feminine | Singular |
| **Third Person** | هُمَا | humā | they (two - m/f) | Common (both) | Dual |
| **Third Person** | هُمْ | hum | they (males) | Masculine | Plural |
| **Third Person** | هُنَّ | hunna | they (females) | Feminine | Plural |
</GrammarTable>

**Key observations:**

1. **First person has no gender distinction** — أَنَا (I) and نَحْنُ (we) are the same for males and females. Gender doesn't matter for "I/we" because the speaker is always obvious.

2. **Second person distinguishes all combinations** — Five "you" pronouns covering masculine/feminine × singular/dual/plural.

3. **Third person dual is gender-neutral** — هُمَا (humā) "they two" can refer to two males OR two females (or mixed). Context clarifies.

4. **Pronunciation patterns:**
   - First person starts with أَ (alif with fatha): أَنَا, أَنْتَ, أَنْتِ, أَنْتُمَا, أَنْتُمْ, أَنْتُنَّ
   - Third person starts with هُ/هِ (hā with damma/kasra): هُوَ, هِيَ, هُمَا, هُمْ, هُنَّ
   - First person plural نَحْنُ is unique

5. **Final vowels create distinctions:**
   - أَنْتَ (anta) vs. أَنْتِ (anti) — fatha vs. kasra
   - هُوَ (huwa) vs. هِيَ (hiya) — damma vs. kasra on first letter
   - هُمْ (hum) vs. هُنَّ (hunna) — short vs. doubled nūn

### Explicit vs. Implicit Pronouns (KEY CONCEPT)

**This is the most important concept in this lesson:** Arabic verbs already contain pronoun information through conjugation. When you see كَتَبَ, the verb itself means "he wrote." The subject "he" is IMPLICIT in the verb form. You don't need to add هُوَ.

**Comparison:**

<GrammarTable>
| Verb | Implicit Pronoun | With Explicit Pronoun | Meaning Difference |
|------|------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| كَتَبَ | (he) | هُوَ كَتَبَ | Normal statement → Emphatic: "HE wrote" (not someone else) |
| كَتَبَتْ | (she) | هِيَ كَتَبَتْ | Normal statement → Emphatic: "SHE wrote" (not someone else) |
| كَتَبُوْا | (they m) | هُمْ كَتَبُوْا | Normal statement → Emphatic: "THEY wrote" (not others) |
| كَتَبْتُ | (I) | أَنَا كَتَبْتُ | Normal statement → Emphatic: "I wrote" (not you) |
| كَتَبْنَا | (we) | نَحْنُ كَتَبْنَا | Normal statement → Emphatic: "WE wrote" (collective action) |
</GrammarTable>

**Rule:** Arabic prefers IMPLICIT pronouns in verbal sentences. The verb alone is sufficient. When an explicit pronoun appears, there's always a reason:
- **Emphasis:** Stressing who performed the action
- **Contrast:** Distinguishing between different subjects ("I did this, but he did that")
- **Clarity after ambiguity:** Resolving confusion when context is unclear

### When Independent Pronouns ARE Required

There are three grammatical contexts where independent pronouns MUST appear:

**1. As subjects of nominal sentences:**

Nominal sentences (jumlah ismiyyah) begin with a noun or pronoun, not a verb. The pronoun serves as the [mubtadaʾ](/resources/glossary/#mubtada) (subject):

- أَنَا طَالِبٌ (anā ṭālibun) "I am a student"
- هُوَ ٱللَّهُ (huwa llāhu) "He is Allah"
- نَحْنُ مُسْلِمُونَ (naḥnu muslimūna) "We are Muslims"

Without the pronoun, there's no subject. The pronoun is grammatically necessary.

**2. After certain particles:**

Some particles require an explicit pronoun:
- إِنَّ and its sisters: إِنَّهُ (innahu) "Indeed, he..."
- لَكِنَّ: لَٰكِنَّهُمْ (lākinnahu) "But they..."
- كَأَنَّ: كَأَنَّهَا (kaʾannahā) "As if she..."

These particles modify nominal sentences and need an explicit pronoun.

**3. For emphasis or contrast in verbal sentences:**

When the speaker wants to emphasize WHO did the action or contrast different subjects:
- أَنَا أَعْلَمُ وَأَنْتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ "I know, but you do not know" (contrast)
- هُوَ ٱللَّهُ ٱلْخَالِقُ "He is Allah, the Creator" (identity emphasis)

### Pronoun-Verb Suffix Correspondence

The verb conjugation suffixes you learned in [L3.03](/learn/level-3/03-past-tense/) and [L3.04](/learn/level-3/04-present-tense/) correspond exactly to these independent pronouns:

<GrammarTable>
| Independent Pronoun | Past Tense Suffix Example | Present Tense Prefix/Suffix Example |
|---------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| أَنَا (I) | كَتَبْتُ (katabtu) | أَكْتُبُ (aktubu) |
| نَحْنُ (we) | كَتَبْنَا (katabnā) | نَكْتُبُ (naktubu) |
| أَنْتَ (you m) | كَتَبْتَ (katabta) | تَكْتُبُ (taktubu) |
| أَنْتِ (you f) | كَتَبْتِ (katabti) | تَكْتُبِينَ (taktubīna) |
| أَنْتُمَا (you two) | كَتَبْتُمَا (katabtumā) | تَكْتُبَانِ (taktubāni) |
| أَنْتُمْ (you m pl) | كَتَبْتُمْ (katabtum) | تَكْتُبُونَ (taktubūna) |
| أَنْتُنَّ (you f pl) | كَتَبْتُنَّ (katabtunna) | تَكْتُبْنَ (taktubna) |
| هُوَ (he) | كَتَبَ (kataba) | يَكْتُبُ (yaktubu) |
| هِيَ (she) | كَتَبَتْ (katabat) | تَكْتُبُ (taktubu) |
| هُمَا (they two) | كَتَبَا (katabā) | يَكْتُبَانِ (yaktubāni) |
| هُمْ (they m) | كَتَبُوْا (katabū) | يَكْتُبُونَ (yaktubūna) |
| هُنَّ (they f) | كَتَبْنَ (katabna) | يَكْتُبْنَ (yaktubna) |
</GrammarTable>

**Insight:** The verb conjugation IS the pronoun in compressed form. When you see يَكْتُبُ, you're seeing "he" built into the يَ prefix. The independent pronoun هُوَ is just the expanded, standalone version.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine subject pronouns in Quranic context with complete morphological analysis:

**Example 1: Emphasis on divine identity (Al-Ikhlas)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥad"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, the One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُوَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis of هُوَ:**
- **Type:** Independent subject pronoun (ḍamīr munfaṣil)
- **Person:** Third person masculine singular
- **Case:** Nominative (mubtadaʾ — subject of nominal sentence)
- **Function:** Emphasis on identity — "HE (and no one else) is Allah"
- **Translation:** "He"

**Sentence structure:** This is a nominal sentence with explicit pronoun for emphasis:
- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** هُوَ (pronoun in nominative case)
- **First predicate (khabar awwal):** ٱللَّهُ (Allah, nominative with damma)
- **Second predicate (khabar thānī):** أَحَدٌ (One, nominative with tanwīn)

The pronoun هُوَ creates intense focus: the verse is declaring WHO this "one" is — HE is Allah. Without the pronoun, the emphasis would be lost.

**Example 2: Continued emphasis (Al-Ikhlas 112:2)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamad"
  translation="Allah, the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
/>

**Note:** Verse 2 does NOT repeat the pronoun. Once the identity is established in verse 1 (هُوَ ٱللَّهُ), subsequent verses continue describing Allah without repeating the pronoun. The emphasis was made; now the description flows naturally.

**Example 3: First person plural "we" (Al-Hijr)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا نَحْنُ نَزَّلْنَا ٱلذِّكْرَ وَإِنَّا لَهُ لَحَافِظُونَ"
  transliteration="innā naḥnu nazzalnā dh-dhikra wa-innā lahu la-ḥāfiẓūn"
  translation="Indeed, it is We who sent down the Reminder, and indeed, We will be its guardian"
  reference="Al-Hijr 15:9"
  highlight="نَحْنُ"
/>

**Morphological analysis of نَحْنُ:**
- **Type:** Independent subject pronoun (ḍamīr munfaṣil)
- **Person:** First person plural
- **Case:** Nominative (subject)
- **Function:** Emphasis on WHO sent down the Quran — Allah Himself
- **Translation:** "We"

**Why نَحْنُ appears here:** The pronoun emphasizes divine agency. The verb نَزَّلْنَا already contains "we" (the suffix نَا), but adding نَحْنُ creates rhetorical weight: "It is WE — We ourselves — who sent down the Reminder." This is the royal "we" (majestic plural) used for Allah's speech, emphasizing grandeur and authority.

**Example 4: Second person pronoun after particle (Al-Ma'un)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَرَءَيْتَ ٱلَّذِي يُكَذِّبُ بِٱلدِّينِ"
  transliteration="araʾayta lladhī yukadhdhibu bi-d-dīn"
  translation="Have you seen the one who denies the Recompense?"
  reference="Al-Ma'un 107:1"
/>

**Analysis:** The verb أَرَءَيْتَ contains the second person suffix ـتَ "you (masculine)." No independent pronoun is needed because this is a verbal sentence, and the verb already indicates "you." The pronoun أَنْتَ would only appear if the speaker wanted to emphasize "YOU (specifically) have seen..."

**Example 5: Pronoun in nominal sentence (Al-Baqarah)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَأَنْتُمْ ٱلْأَعْلَوْنَ إِنْ كُنْتُمْ مُؤْمِنِينَ"
  transliteration="wa-antumu l-aʿlawna in kuntum muʾminīn"
  translation="And you will be superior if you are believers"
  reference="Al Imran 3:139"
  highlight="أَنْتُمْ"
/>

**Morphological analysis of أَنْتُمْ:**
- **Type:** Independent subject pronoun (ḍamīr munfaṣil)
- **Person:** Second person masculine plural
- **Case:** Nominative (mubtadaʾ — subject of nominal sentence)
- **Function:** Subject of nominal sentence "You are the superior ones"
- **Translation:** "You (males plural)"

**Why أَنْتُمْ appears here:** This is a NOMINAL sentence, not a verbal sentence. The structure is:
- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** أَنْتُمْ (you — pronoun in nominative)
- **Predicate (khabar):** ٱلْأَعْلَوْنَ (the superior ones — nominative with ـُونَ)

Nominal sentences REQUIRE a subject. The pronoun is grammatically necessary, not just emphatic.

**Example 6: Word-by-word breakdown**

Let's analyze a complete verse with multiple pronouns:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّنِي أَنَا ٱللَّهُ لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا أَنَا فَٱعْبُدْنِي"
  transliteration="innanī anā llāhu lā ilāha illā anā fa-ʿbudnī"
  translation="Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me"
  reference="Ta-Ha 20:14"
/>

**Word-by-word morphological analysis:**

| Word | Analysis |
|------|----------|
| إِنَّنِي | Particle إِنَّ + attached pronoun ـنِي (1st person) "Indeed, I" |
| أَنَا | Independent pronoun, 1st person singular, emphasis: "I (Myself)" |
| ٱللَّهُ | Proper noun "Allah," nominative case (predicate of إِنَّ) |
| لَا | Negative particle "no/not" |
| إِلَٰهَ | Noun "deity," accusative case after لَا |
| إِلَّا | Exceptive particle "except" |
| أَنَا | Independent pronoun, 1st person singular, "Me/I" (after exception) |
| فَٱعْبُدْنِي | Conjunction فَ + imperative اُعْبُدْ + attached pronoun ـنِي "so worship Me" |

**Focus on أَنَا:** It appears TWICE in this verse:
1. **First أَنَا:** Emphatic subject after إِنَّنِي. Reinforces divine identity: "I — I Myself — am Allah"
2. **Second أَنَا:** After the exception إِلَّا. Required grammatically after exceptive constructions.

This verse demonstrates THREE uses of pronouns:
- **Attached pronoun** ـنِي (on إِنَّ and on اُعْبُدْ)
- **Independent pronoun** أَنَا (twice, for emphasis and grammar)
- All referring to the same first person: Allah speaking

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**Independent Subject Pronoun Rules (Ḍamāʾir al-Rafʿ)**

1. **Arabic has 12 independent subject pronouns**:
   - First person: أَنَا (I), نَحْنُ (we)
   - Second person: أَنْتَ, أَنْتِ, أَنْتُمَا, أَنْتُمْ, أَنْتُنَّ (you in 5 forms)
   - Third person: هُوَ, هِيَ, هُمَا, هُمْ, هُنَّ (he/she/they in 5 forms)

2. **Implicit vs. Explicit Pronouns**:
   - **Implicit:** Pronouns built into verb conjugations (كَتَبَ = "he wrote")
   - **Explicit:** Independent pronouns appearing separately (هُوَ كَتَبَ = "HE wrote")
   - Arabic PREFERS implicit pronouns in verbal sentences
   - Explicit pronouns add emphasis or are grammatically required

3. **When explicit pronouns ARE required**:
   - **Nominal sentence subjects:** أَنَا طَالِبٌ "I am a student"
   - **After particles:** إِنَّهُ "Indeed, he..."
   - **Emphasis/contrast:** هُوَ كَتَبَ "HE wrote (not someone else)"

4. **Pronoun-verb correspondence**:
   - Every independent pronoun matches a verb conjugation
   - أَنَا → كَتَبْتُ / أَكْتُبُ (I)
   - هُوَ → كَتَبَ / يَكْتُبُ (he)
   - The verb suffix/prefix IS the pronoun in compressed form

5. **Gender and number distinctions**:
   - First person (أَنَا, نَحْنُ): No gender distinction
   - Second person: Five pronouns distinguishing masculine/feminine/dual/plural
   - Third person dual (هُمَا): Same for masculine and feminine
   - All others distinguish gender

6. **Nominative case function**:
   - Subject pronouns take nominative case (rafʿ) when functioning as subjects
   - That's why they're called ضَمَائِرُ ٱلرَّفْعِ "pronouns of the nominative"
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Mistakes with Subject Pronouns**

1. **Adding pronouns where verbs are sufficient**: Don't write هُوَ كَتَبَ when كَتَبَ alone is enough. Arabic verbs already contain the pronoun. Adding it creates unnecessary emphasis. Only use explicit pronouns when there's a specific reason (emphasis, contrast, or grammatical requirement).

2. **Confusing أَنْتَ (you masculine) with أَنْتِ (you feminine)**: The only difference is the final vowel — fatha vs. kasra. Listen carefully: أَنْتَ (anta) vs. أَنْتِ (anti). In connected speech, this distinction can be subtle.

3. **Mixing up هُوَ (he) and هِيَ (she)**: The first letter differs: هُوَ has damma (u), هِيَ has kasra (i). Also note the different final letters: waw (و) vs. yā (ي).

4. **Forgetting dual pronouns exist**: Arabic has THREE distinct pronouns for "they": هُمَا (two people), هُمْ (males plural), هُنَّ (females plural). Don't use هُمْ when referring to exactly two people — use هُمَا.

5. **Using أَنْتُمْ for mixed-gender groups**: When addressing a group of both males and females, use the masculine plural أَنْتُمْ (antum), not the feminine أَنْتُنَّ (antunna). The masculine form is the default for mixed groups.

6. **Assuming pronouns always translate directly to English**: The royal "we" (نَحْنُ) in the Quran refers to Allah (singular), not a plural deity. Context determines whether نَحْنُ means literal "we" or majestic "We."

7. **Ignoring emphasis when translating**: When you see هُوَ ٱللَّهُ, don't just translate "He is Allah." The pronoun adds emphasis: "HE is Allah" or "It is HE who is Allah." The English translation should reflect the rhetorical weight.

## Practice Exercises

<ExerciseBox level="beginner" id="pronoun-matching">
**Exercise 1: Pronoun Matching**

Match each Arabic pronoun to its English translation:

1. أَنَا
2. هُوَ
3. نَحْنُ
4. هُمْ
5. أَنْتَ
6. هِيَ
7. أَنْتُمْ
8. هُنَّ

**Options:** she, I, they (females), he, you (male), we, you (males), they (males)

**Answers:**
1. أَنَا — I
2. هُوَ — he
3. نَحْنُ — we
4. هُمْ — they (males)
5. أَنْتَ — you (male)
6. هِيَ — she
7. أَنْتُمْ — you (males)
8. هُنَّ — they (females)
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox level="beginner" id="implicit-explicit-distinction">
**Exercise 2: Implicit vs. Explicit Pronouns**

For each verb, identify whether the pronoun is implicit (built into the verb) or explicit (stated separately). If implicit, identify which pronoun it represents:

1. كَتَبُوْا
2. هُمْ كَتَبُوْا
3. أَكْتُبُ
4. أَنَا أَكْتُبُ
5. تَكْتُبُ
6. هِيَ تَكْتُبُ

**Answers:**
1. **كَتَبُوْا** — IMPLICIT. The suffix ـُوْا represents "they (masculine)" — the pronoun هُمْ is built in.
2. **هُمْ كَتَبُوْا** — EXPLICIT. The independent pronoun هُمْ "they" appears separately for emphasis: "THEY wrote."
3. **أَكْتُبُ** — IMPLICIT. The prefix أَ represents "I" — the pronoun أَنَا is built in.
4. **أَنَا أَكْتُبُ** — EXPLICIT. The independent pronoun أَنَا "I" appears separately for emphasis: "I write."
5. **تَكْتُبُ** — IMPLICIT. The prefix تَ represents "you (m)" or "she" — the pronoun is built in.
6. **هِيَ تَكْتُبُ** — EXPLICIT. The independent pronoun هِيَ "she" appears separately for clarity or emphasis: "SHE writes."
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox level="intermediate" id="quranic-pronoun-usage">
**Exercise 3: Quranic Pronoun Analysis**

Analyze all explicit pronouns in Surah Al-Ikhlas (112). For each pronoun, explain WHY it appears (emphasis, grammatical requirement, etc.):

**Surah Al-Ikhlas (112):**
قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ

**Answers:**

**Verse 1:** قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ
- **Pronoun:** هُوَ (huwa) "He"
- **Person:** Third person masculine singular
- **Function:** Subject (mubtadaʾ) of nominal sentence
- **Why it appears:** EMPHASIS on divine identity. The verse declares WHO this "One" is. Without هُوَ, there would be no subject for the nominal sentence. The pronoun creates rhetorical weight: "HE is Allah, the One."

**Verses 2-4:** No explicit pronouns appear.
- Verse 2: ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ — nominal sentence with Allah as subject, no pronoun needed
- Verse 3: لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ — two verbal sentences with implicit third person subjects
- Verse 4: وَلَمْ يَكُنْ لَهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ — the pronoun ـهُ in لَهُ is an ATTACHED pronoun ("to Him"), not an independent subject pronoun

**Summary:** Only ONE independent pronoun (هُوَ) in the entire surah, used for maximum emphasis in the opening declaration.

**Exercise 4: Choosing the Correct Pronoun**

Fill in the blank with the appropriate independent pronoun:

1. _____ عَالِمَةٌ (she is a scholar)
2. _____ مُسْلِمُونَ (we are Muslims)
3. _____ كَتَبْتَ ٱلْكِتَابَ (YOU wrote the book — emphasis on "you")
4. _____ ٱلْخَالِقُ (He is the Creator)
5. _____ تَذْهَبَانِ إِلَى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ (you two go to the mosque)

**Answers:**
1. **هِيَ** عَالِمَةٌ (hiya ʿālimahun) — Nominal sentence requires subject pronoun "she"
2. **نَحْنُ** مُسْلِمُونَ (naḥnu muslimūna) — Nominal sentence requires subject pronoun "we"
3. **أَنْتَ** كَتَبْتَ ٱلْكِتَابَ (anta katabta l-kitāb) — Emphatic pronoun "you (m)" before verb
4. **هُوَ** ٱلْخَالِقُ (huwa l-khāliqu) — Nominal sentence requires subject pronoun "he"
5. **أَنْتُمَا** تَذْهَبَانِ إِلَى ٱلْمَسْجِدِ (antumā tadhhabāni ilā l-masjid) — Dual pronoun "you two"
