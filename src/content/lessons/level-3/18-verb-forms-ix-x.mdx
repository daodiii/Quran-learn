## Introduction

You are one lesson away from mastering all ten Arabic verb forms. With Forms I through VIII behind you, only two remain: the rare Form IX (colors and defects) and the important Form X (seeking and requesting). Let's begin with one of the most recognized Form X verbs in the entire Quran:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفَّارًۭا"
  transliteration="istaghfirū rabbakum innahu kāna ghaffāran"
  translation="Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver"
  reference="Nuh 71:10"
  highlight="ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟", tr: "istaghfirū", en: "ask forgiveness" },
    { ar: "رَبَّكُمْ", tr: "rabbakum", en: "of your Lord" },
    { ar: "إِنَّهُۥ", tr: "innahu", en: "indeed He" },
    { ar: "كَانَ", tr: "kāna", en: "is ever" },
    { ar: "غَفَّارًۭا", tr: "ghaffāran", en: "a Perpetual Forgiver" }
  ]}
/>

Look at **ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟** (istaghfirū) "ask forgiveness" — from root غ-ف-ر (gh-f-r) meaning "forgiving." The **اِسْتَ** prefix at the start is the unmistakable marker of Form X: **اِسْتَفْعَلَ** (istafʿala). Form X adds "seeking/requesting" to the root meaning: forgiveness (غ-ف-ر) becomes "seeking forgiveness" (اِسْتَغْفَرَ). This is arguably the most important Form X verb for every Muslim.

This lesson completes the traditional ten-form verb system. Form IX is extremely rare — it appears almost exclusively with color and defect roots. Form X, by contrast, is common and important, appearing regularly throughout the Quran. You'll spend most of your time here mastering Form X, with just enough coverage of Form IX to recognize it if you encounter it.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize the Form IX pattern (اِفْعَلَّ / ifʿalla) and understand its specialized color/defect meaning
- Master the Form X pattern (اِسْتَفْعَلَ / istafʿala) and its three semantic functions
- Conjugate Form X in past and present tenses for key persons
- Use a complete 10-form master reference chart to identify any Arabic verb form
- Apply a quick identification flowchart for Forms VII-X

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.17 Verb Forms VII & VIII](/learn/level-3/17-verb-forms-vii-viii/), you learned the passive/reflexive Form VII (اِنْفَعَلَ) and the reflexive/effortful Form VIII (اِفْتَعَلَ) with its critical assimilation rules. Forms IX and X complete the set of four forms that all begin with hamza-kasra (اِ). What follows the hamza distinguishes them: نْ (VII), first root + تَ (VIII), first root + second root + doubled third (IX), or سْتَ (X).

**Forward connection:** After completing all ten forms, you'll move to [L3.19 Active & Passive Participles](/learn/level-3/19-active-passive-participles/), where EVERY verb form (I through X) derives participles using predictable patterns. Knowing all ten forms gives you the complete foundation for that lesson. You've also built on the individual form lessons from [L3.02](/learn/level-3/02-verb-form-i/) through [L3.16](/learn/level-3/16-verb-form-vi/), where you studied Forms I-VI in detail.

## Form IX: اِفْعَلَّ (ifʿalla) — Colors and Defects

**Plain English first:** Form IX is the RAREST of all ten forms. It exists almost exclusively to describe becoming a color or acquiring a physical quality. Think of it as the "turning red," "turning white," or "going blind" form. You will rarely encounter it, but you should recognize the pattern when you do.

### The Form IX Pattern

**Template:** اِفْعَلَّ (ifʿalla)

- **اِ** (i) = PREFIX
- **ف** (fa) = position of the FIRST root letter
- **ع** (ʿa) = position of the SECOND root letter
- **لَّ** (lla) = position of the THIRD root letter — **DOUBLED** with shadda

**Visual pattern breakdown:**

```
Root: ح-م-ر (ḥ-m-r) "redness"

Form I pattern:   فَعَلَ    →  حَمِرَ    "he was/became red"
                  (simple 3 letters)

Form IX pattern:  اِفْعَلَّ  →  اِحْمَرَّ   "it became red / turned red"
                  (اِ prefix + doubled final root letter)
```

The **doubled final root letter** (shadda on the last letter) is the distinctive marker. Combined with the اِ prefix and sukun on the first root letter, this creates Form IX's unique signature.

### Core Meaning: Becoming a Color or Physical Quality

Form IX describes:
- **Becoming a color:** "it turned red," "it became white," "it became black"
- **Acquiring a physical quality:** "he became crooked," "he became blind" (rare usage)

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form IX Examples: Color Roots"
  headers={["Root", "Color Meaning", "Form IX", "Transliteration", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ح-م-ر", "redness", "اِحْمَرَّ", "iḥmarra", "it became red"],
    ["س-و-د", "blackness", "اِسْوَدَّ", "iswadda", "it became black"],
    ["ب-ي-ض", "whiteness", "اِبْيَضَّ", "ibyaḍḍa", "it became white"],
    ["ص-ف-ر", "yellowness", "اِصْفَرَّ", "iṣfarra", "it became yellow"],
    ["خ-ض-ر", "greenness", "اِخْضَرَّ", "ikhḍarra", "it became green"]
  ]}
/>

### Conjugation: Brief Reference

Because Form IX is so rare, a brief conjugation table for the most essential persons is sufficient:

**Past tense pattern:** اِفْعَلَّ (ifʿalla)
**Present tense pattern:** يَفْعَلُّ (yafʿallu)

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form IX Conjugation: اِحْمَرَّ (iḥmarra) — 'it became red' (root: ح-م-ر)"
  headers={["Person", "Past Tense", "Transliteration", "Present Tense", "Transliteration"]}
  rows={[
    ["he (3ms)", "اِحْمَرَّ", "iḥmarra", "يَحْمَرُّ", "yaḥmarru"],
    ["she (3fs)", "اِحْمَرَّتْ", "iḥmarrat", "تَحْمَرُّ", "taḥmarru"],
    ["they m. (3mp)", "اِحْمَرُّوا", "iḥmarrū", "يَحْمَرُّونَ", "yaḥmarrūna"]
  ]}
/>

Notice: the present tense retains the doubled final letter (shadda) and uses damma (ـُـ) on the second root letter: يَفْعَلُّ (yafʿallu).

### Form IX in the Quran

While Form IX as a full verb is extremely rare in the Quran, the color roots themselves appear in powerful Quranic verses. The most striking example uses Form IX verbs directly:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌۭ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌۭ"
  transliteration="yawma tabyaḍḍu wujūhun wa-taswaddu wujūhun"
  translation="The Day [some] faces will turn white and [some] faces will turn black"
  reference="Al 'Imran 3:106"
  highlight="تَبْيَضُّ,تَسْوَدُّ"
  words={[
    { ar: "يَوْمَ", tr: "yawma", en: "the Day" },
    { ar: "تَبْيَضُّ", tr: "tabyaḍḍu", en: "will turn white" },
    { ar: "وُجُوهٌۭ", tr: "wujūhun", en: "[some] faces" },
    { ar: "وَتَسْوَدُّ", tr: "wa-taswaddu", en: "and will turn black" },
    { ar: "وُجُوهٌۭ", tr: "wujūhun", en: "[some] faces" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **تَبْيَضُّ** (tabyaḍḍu) — "it turns white"
  - Root: ب-ي-ض (b-y-ḍ) "whiteness"
  - Pattern: تَفْعَلُّ (tafʿallu) — Form IX present tense, 3rd person feminine
  - Marker: doubled final letter (ـضُّ with shadda)
  - Meaning: "it becomes white" — faces becoming radiant, illuminated
- **تَسْوَدُّ** (taswaddu) — "it turns black"
  - Root: س-و-د (s-w-d) "blackness"
  - Pattern: تَفْعَلُّ (tafʿallu) — Form IX present tense, 3rd person feminine
  - Marker: doubled final letter (ـدُّ with shadda)
  - Meaning: "it becomes black" — faces becoming darkened with disgrace

This verse is a rare and powerful use of Form IX verbs in the Quran. The contrast between اِبْيَضَّ and اِسْوَدَّ — white faces of the blessed and black faces of the condemned — uses the color-change meaning of Form IX perfectly.

<Callout type="tip" title="Don't memorize Form IX conjugations">
Form IX is the rarest of all ten verb forms. You will almost never need to produce a Form IX verb yourself. Just know three things:

1. **Pattern:** اِ prefix + doubled final root letter (shadda)
2. **Meaning:** becoming a color or physical quality
3. **Recognition:** if you see اِ at the start and shadda on the final letter, consider Form IX

That's enough. Focus your energy on Form X instead — it's far more common and useful.
</Callout>

## Form X: اِسْتَفْعَلَ (istafʿala) — Seeking/Requesting

**Plain English first:** Form X is one of the most important derived forms. Its prefix **اِسْتَ** (ista) is the longest and most distinctive of all ten forms — once you know it, you'll never confuse Form X with anything else. Form X typically means "seeking" or "requesting" the root action.

Think of these English parallels:
- "forgiveness" → "seeking forgiveness" (asking to be forgiven)
- "help" → "seeking help" (asking for assistance)
- "good" → "deeming good" (considering something to be good)
- "big" → "acting big" (being arrogant)
- "hidden" → "seeking to hide" (concealing oneself)

In English, we add "seek," "ask for," "deem," or "consider to be." In Arabic, you add **اِسْتَ** to the front of the root, and the meaning shifts accordingly.

### The Form X Pattern

**Template:** اِسْتَفْعَلَ (istafʿala)

- **اِسْتَ** (ista) = SEEKING/REQUESTING PREFIX (the Form X marker — the longest prefix in the entire 10-form system)
- **ف** (fa) = position of the FIRST root letter
- **ع** (ʿa) = position of the SECOND root letter
- **ل** (la) = position of the THIRD root letter

**Visual pattern breakdown:**

```
Root: غ-ف-ر (gh-f-r) "forgiving"

Form I pattern:   فَعَلَ      →  غَفَرَ      "he forgave"
                  (simple 3 letters)

Form X pattern:   اِسْتَفْعَلَ  →  اِسْتَغْفَرَ  "he sought forgiveness"
                  (اِسْتَ prefix before root)
```

The **اِسْتَ** at the beginning is impossible to miss — it's three extra letters before the root, making Form X verbs noticeably longer than most other forms.

### Three Semantic Functions

Form X expresses three related types of meaning:

**1. Seeking/Requesting — "to seek or ask for [the root action]"**

The most common Form X meaning. The subject requests or seeks the action described by the root.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form X: Seeking/Requesting Meaning"
  headers={["Root", "Root Meaning", "Form X", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["غ-ف-ر", "forgiving", "اِسْتَغْفَرَ (istaghfara)", "he sought forgiveness"],
    ["ع-و-ن", "helping", "اِسْتَعَانَ (istaʿāna)", "he sought help"],
    ["ع-ذ-ب", "refuge", "اِسْتَعَاذَ (istaʿādha)", "he sought refuge"],
    ["ج-ب-ب", "responding", "اِسْتَجَابَ (istajāba)", "he responded (sought an answer)"],
    ["خ-ر-ج", "going out", "اِسْتَخْرَجَ (istakhraja)", "he extracted (sought to bring out)"]
  ]}
/>

**2. Deeming/Considering — "to deem or consider something to be [quality]"**

The subject considers or judges something to have a certain quality from the root meaning.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form X: Deeming/Considering Meaning"
  headers={["Root", "Root Meaning", "Form X", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ح-س-ن", "goodness", "اِسْتَحْسَنَ (istaḥsana)", "he deemed good / approved"],
    ["ك-ب-ر", "greatness", "اِسْتَكْبَرَ (istakbara)", "he deemed himself great / was arrogant"],
    ["ح-ق-ق", "truth", "اِسْتَحَقَّ (istaḥaqqa)", "he deemed worthy / deserved"],
    ["ب-ع-د", "distance", "اِسْتَبْعَدَ (istabaʿada)", "he deemed far / considered unlikely"]
  ]}
/>

**3. Finding oneself in a state — "to come to be in [the root state]"**

Less common, but Form X can express the subject discovering themselves in a certain condition.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form X: Coming into a State"
  headers={["Root", "Root Meaning", "Form X", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ي-ق-ظ", "wakefulness", "اِسْتَيْقَظَ (istayqaẓa)", "he woke up / found himself awake"],
    ["ق-ر-ر", "settling", "اِسْتَقَرَّ (istaqarra)", "he settled / became established"],
    ["و-ي-ي", "equality", "اِسْتَوَى (istawā)", "he leveled / became even"]
  ]}
/>

### Conjugation: Past and Present

**Past tense pattern:** اِسْتَفْعَلَ (istafʿala)
**Present tense pattern:** يَسْتَفْعِلُ (yastafʿilu)

In the present tense, the initial hamza drops and the prefix يَـ is added before the سْتَ. The vowel on the second root letter changes to kasra (ـِـ) in the present.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form X Conjugation: اِسْتَغْفَرَ (istaghfara) — 'he sought forgiveness' (root: غ-ف-ر)"
  headers={["Person", "Past Tense", "Transliteration", "Present Tense", "Transliteration"]}
  rows={[
    ["he (3ms)", "اِسْتَغْفَرَ", "istaghfara", "يَسْتَغْفِرُ", "yastaghfiru"],
    ["she (3fs)", "اِسْتَغْفَرَتْ", "istaghfarat", "تَسْتَغْفِرُ", "tastaghfiru"],
    ["they m. (3mp)", "اِسْتَغْفَرُوا", "istaghfarū", "يَسْتَغْفِرُونَ", "yastaghfirūna"],
    ["you m. (2ms)", "اِسْتَغْفَرْتَ", "istaghfarta", "تَسْتَغْفِرُ", "tastaghfiru"],
    ["I (1s)", "اِسْتَغْفَرْتُ", "istaghfartu", "أَسْتَغْفِرُ", "astaghfiru"]
  ]}
/>

**Key observations:**
1. The stem **اِسْتَغْفَرْ** remains constant throughout the past tense — only the suffix changes
2. In the present tense, the prefix replaces the initial hamza: يَسْتَغْفِرُ (he), تَسْتَغْفِرُ (she/you), أَسْتَغْفِرُ (I), نَسْتَغْفِرُ (we)
3. The present tense vowel pattern shifts: second root letter gets kasra (ـِـ) instead of fatha (ـَـ)

### Quranic Examples

**Example 1: ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ — "Ask forgiveness" (Seeking meaning)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟ رَبَّكُمْ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ غَفَّارًۭا"
  transliteration="istaghfirū rabbakum innahu kāna ghaffāran"
  translation="Ask forgiveness of your Lord. Indeed, He is ever a Perpetual Forgiver"
  reference="Nuh 71:10"
  highlight="ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱسْتَغْفِرُوا۟", tr: "istaghfirū", en: "ask forgiveness" },
    { ar: "رَبَّكُمْ", tr: "rabbakum", en: "of your Lord" },
    { ar: "إِنَّهُۥ", tr: "innahu", en: "indeed He" },
    { ar: "كَانَ", tr: "kāna", en: "is ever" },
    { ar: "غَفَّارًۭا", tr: "ghaffāran", en: "a Perpetual Forgiver" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** غ-ف-ر (gh-f-r) "forgiving"
- **Pattern:** اِسْتَفْعِلُوا (istafʿilū) — Form X imperative, 2nd person masculine plural
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix (clearly visible before the root letters)
- **Meaning:** "seek forgiveness" — requesting the root action (forgiveness) from Allah
- **Note:** The same verse also contains غَفَّارًا (ghaffāran), a Form I intensive adjective from the same root — a beautiful echo of root غ-ف-ر across two different patterns

**Example 2: ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ — "Seek help" (Seeking meaning, weak root)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟ بِٱلصَّبْرِ وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ ۚ وَإِنَّهَا لَكَبِيرَةٌ إِلَّا عَلَى ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ"
  transliteration="istaʿīnū bi-ṣ-ṣabri wa-ṣ-ṣalāti wa-innahā la-kabīratun illā ʿalā l-khāshiʿīna"
  translation="Seek help through patience and prayer, and indeed, it is difficult except for the humbly submissive"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:45"
  highlight="ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱسْتَعِينُوا۟", tr: "istaʿīnū", en: "seek help" },
    { ar: "بِٱلصَّبْرِ", tr: "bi-ṣ-ṣabri", en: "through patience" },
    { ar: "وَٱلصَّلَوٰةِ", tr: "wa-ṣ-ṣalāti", en: "and prayer" },
    { ar: "وَإِنَّهَا", tr: "wa-innahā", en: "and indeed it" },
    { ar: "لَكَبِيرَةٌ", tr: "la-kabīratun", en: "is difficult" },
    { ar: "إِلَّا", tr: "illā", en: "except" },
    { ar: "عَلَى", tr: "ʿalā", en: "for" },
    { ar: "ٱلْخَٰشِعِينَ", tr: "al-khāshiʿīna", en: "the humbly submissive" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** ع-و-ن (ʿ-w-n) "helping"
- **Pattern:** اِسْتَفْعِلُوا → اِسْتَعِينُوا (Form X imperative with weak middle root)
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix before the root
- **Meaning:** "seek help" — requesting the root action (help/assistance)
- **Weak root behavior:** The middle root letter و (waw) transforms in Form X: اِسْتَعْوَنَ → اِسْتَعَانَ (past), يَسْتَعْوِنُ → يَسْتَعِينُ (present). The و becomes a long vowel, which is typical of hollow (middle-weak) verbs.

**Example 3: وَٱسْتَبَقَا — "And they raced" (Seeking meaning)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱسْتَبَقَا ٱلْبَابَ وَقَدَّتْ قَمِيصَهُۥ مِن دُبُرٍۢ"
  transliteration="wa-stabaqā l-bāba wa-qaddat qamīṣahu min duburin"
  translation="And they raced each other to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back"
  reference="Yusuf 12:25"
  highlight="وَٱسْتَبَقَا"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَٱسْتَبَقَا", tr: "wa-stabaqā", en: "and they raced" },
    { ar: "ٱلْبَابَ", tr: "al-bāba", en: "to the door" },
    { ar: "وَقَدَّتْ", tr: "wa-qaddat", en: "and she tore" },
    { ar: "قَمِيصَهُۥ", tr: "qamīṣahu", en: "his shirt" },
    { ar: "مِن", tr: "min", en: "from" },
    { ar: "دُبُرٍۢ", tr: "duburin", en: "the back" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** س-ب-ق (s-b-q) "preceding"
- **Pattern:** اِسْتَفْعَلَا (istafʿalā) — Form X past tense, dual subject
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix; dual suffix ـَا marks "they two"
- **Meaning:** "they two sought to precede each other" — each trying to get to the door first. The "seeking" meaning is clear: they were seeking to beat the other.

**Example 4: ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ — "They were arrogant" (Deeming meaning)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَالَ ٱلْمَلَأُ ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ مِن قَوْمِهِۦ لِلَّذِينَ ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟"
  transliteration="qāla l-malaʾu lladhīna stakbarū min qawmihi lilladhīna stuḍʿifū"
  translation="Said the eminent ones who were arrogant among his people to those who were oppressed"
  reference="Al-A'raf 7:75"
  highlight="ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟"
  words={[
    { ar: "قَالَ", tr: "qāla", en: "said" },
    { ar: "ٱلْمَلَأُ", tr: "al-malaʾu", en: "the eminent ones" },
    { ar: "ٱلَّذِينَ", tr: "alladhīna", en: "who" },
    { ar: "ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟", tr: "istakbarū", en: "were arrogant" },
    { ar: "مِن", tr: "min", en: "among" },
    { ar: "قَوْمِهِۦ", tr: "qawmihi", en: "his people" },
    { ar: "لِلَّذِينَ", tr: "lilladhīna", en: "to those who" },
    { ar: "ٱسْتُضْعِفُوا۟", tr: "istuḍʿifū", en: "were oppressed" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** ك-ب-ر (k-b-r) "greatness"
- **Pattern:** اِسْتَفْعَلُوا (istafʿalū) — Form X past tense, 3mp
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix
- **Meaning:** "they deemed themselves great" — they considered themselves superior (arrogance). This is the "deeming" function of Form X.
- **Contrast:** Notice اِسْتُضْعِفُوا۟ (istuḍʿifū) in the same verse — also Form X (root ض-ع-ف "weakness"), passive voice: "they were deemed weak / oppressed." Two Form X verbs side by side showing opposite meanings.

**Example 5: يَسْتَخْفُونَ — "They conceal" (Seeking meaning)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱلنَّاسِ وَلَا يَسْتَخْفُونَ مِنَ ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="yastakhfūna mina n-nāsi wa-lā yastakhfūna mina llāhi"
  translation="They conceal [their evil intentions and deeds] from the people, but they cannot conceal from Allah"
  reference="An-Nisa 4:108"
  highlight="يَسْتَخْفُونَ"
  words={[
    { ar: "يَسْتَخْفُونَ", tr: "yastakhfūna", en: "they conceal" },
    { ar: "مِنَ", tr: "mina", en: "from" },
    { ar: "ٱلنَّاسِ", tr: "an-nāsi", en: "the people" },
    { ar: "وَلَا", tr: "wa-lā", en: "but they do not" },
    { ar: "يَسْتَخْفُونَ", tr: "yastakhfūna", en: "conceal" },
    { ar: "مِنَ", tr: "mina", en: "from" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "allāhi", en: "Allah" }
  ]}
/>

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** خ-ف-ي (kh-f-y) "hidden/concealed"
- **Pattern:** يَسْتَفْعِلُونَ (yastafʿilūna) — Form X present tense, 3mp
- **Marker:** يَسْتَ prefix in present tense
- **Meaning:** "they seek to be hidden" — actively trying to conceal themselves and their deeds from people

**Example 6: ٱسْتَقِيمُوا — "Be steadfast" (Finding oneself in a state)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ ٱلَّذِينَ قَالُوا۟ رَبُّنَا ٱللَّهُ ثُمَّ ٱسْتَقَٰمُوا۟ تَتَنَزَّلُ عَلَيْهِمُ ٱلْمَلَٰٓئِكَةُ"

**Morphological analysis:**
- **Root:** ق-و-م (q-w-m) "standing/establishing"
- **Pattern:** اِسْتَفْعَلُوا → اِسْتَقَامُوا (Form X past tense, 3mp, with weak middle root)
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix
- **Meaning:** "they remained firm/steadfast" — establishing themselves on the straight path. The Form X meaning here is "seeking to stand firm" which becomes "being steadfast."

<Callout type="warning" title="Form X with weak roots">
Several important Form X verbs come from roots with weak middle letters (و or ي). When this happens, the weak letter becomes a long vowel:

- **اِسْتَعَانَ** (istaʿāna) from root ع-و-ن: the و becomes long ā (past) / long ī in present يَسْتَعِينُ
- **اِسْتَقَامَ** (istaqāma) from root ق-و-م: the و becomes long ā (past) / long ī in present يَسْتَقِيمُ
- **اِسْتَجَابَ** (istajāba) from root ج-و-ب: the و becomes long ā (past) / long ī in present يَسْتَجِيبُ

The اِسْتَ prefix is still clearly visible, so Form X recognition is not affected — but root extraction requires knowing about this weak-root behavior.

**Pattern trends to notice:**
- **Forms I-IV:** Each has a unique augmentation — no prefix (I), doubled middle (II), alif after first (III), alif prefix (IV)
- **Forms V-VI:** Mirror Forms II-III with added تَ prefix (reflexive/reciprocal of the parent form)
- **Forms VII-X:** All start with hamza voweled with kasra (اِ), then differ in what follows
- **Present tense prefixes:** Forms I, VII, VIII, IX, X use فَتْحَة (يَـ), while Forms II, III, IV use ضَمَّة (يُـ), and Forms V, VI use فَتْحَة + تَ (يَتَـ)

With all ten forms on one chart, you can now identify ANY Arabic verb by matching its pattern to this table. When you encounter an unfamiliar verb in the Quran:

1. Check the prefix and internal structure
2. Match it against the chart
3. Determine the form number
4. Use the "core meaning" column to understand the semantic shift from the root

Bookmark this chart. Return to it often. Over time, pattern recognition will become automatic.

## Quick Identification Flowchart: Forms VII-X

When you encounter a verb that starts with اِ (hamza-kasra), use this decision tree to identify which of Forms VII-X you're looking at:

**Step 1: Does it start with اِسْتَ?**
- YES → **Form X** (اِسْتَفْعَلَ). This is the easiest to spot — three letters before the root.
- NO → Go to Step 2.

**Step 2: Does it start with اِنْ?**
- YES → **Form VII** (اِنْفَعَلَ). The نْ before the root letters confirms it.
- NO → Go to Step 3.

**Step 3: Does it start with اِ and have a doubled final letter (shadda)?**
- YES → **Form IX** (اِفْعَلَّ). The doubled end + اِ start = color/defect form.
- NO → Go to Step 4.

**Step 4: Does it start with اِ + [consonant] + تَ (a تَ between the first and second root letters)?**
- YES → **Form VIII** (اِفْتَعَلَ). Remember to check for assimilation (the تَ may be disguised).
- NO → Recheck — it might be a Form VIII with heavy assimilation (اِتَّـ, اِصْطَـ, اِضْطَـ).

**Quick summary:**
- اِسْتَ → Form X
- اِنْ → Form VII
- اِ...َّ (doubled final) → Form IX
- اِ + تَ after 1st root → Form VIII

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Form IX: اِفْعَلَّ (ifʿalla)">
**Marker:** اِ prefix + doubled final root letter (shadda on the third root letter)

**Meaning:** Becoming a color or acquiring a physical quality — EXTREMELY RARE

**Present tense:** يَفْعَلُّ (yafʿallu)

**Recognition:** اِ at the start and a shadda on the final letter of the root

**Example:** اِحْمَرَّ (iḥmarra) "it became red" — root ح-م-ر

**Frequency:** The rarest of all ten forms. Almost never appears outside color/defect vocabulary.
</Callout>

<Callout type="rule" title="Form X: اِسْتَفْعَلَ (istafʿala)">
**Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix at the beginning — the most distinctive prefix in the entire ten-form system

**Meaning:** Seeking/requesting the root action, deeming something to have a quality, or finding oneself in a state

**Present tense:** يَسْتَفْعِلُ (yastafʿilu)

**Recognition:** Any verb starting with اِسْتَ (or يَسْتَ / تَسْتَ / أَسْتَ / نَسْتَ in present tense) is Form X

**Example:** اِسْتَغْفَرَ (istaghfara) "he sought forgiveness" — root غ-ف-ر

**Frequency:** Fairly common in the Quran. Key verbs include اِسْتَغْفَرَ (seek forgiveness), اِسْتَعَانَ (seek help), اِسْتَكْبَرَ (be arrogant), اِسْتَقَامَ (be steadfast).

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Master Identification — Identify the form number (I through X) for each verb.">

**1. كَتَبَ (kataba) — "he wrote"**

**Form I.** No augmentation. Simple three root letters in the basic فَعَلَ pattern. Root: ك-ت-ب.

**2. عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "he taught"**

**Form II.** Doubled middle letter (shadda on ل). Pattern: فَعَّلَ. Root: ع-ل-م.

**3. اِسْتَغْفَرَ (istaghfara) — "he sought forgiveness"**

**Form X.** اِسْتَ prefix at the beginning. Pattern: اِسْتَفْعَلَ. Root: غ-ف-ر.

**4. تَعَاوَنَ (taʿāwana) — "they cooperated"**

**Form III.** Alif after first root letter. Pattern: فَاعَلَ. Root: ق-ت-ل.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Root Extraction from Form X — Extract the three-letter root from each Form X verb.">

**1. اِسْتَكْبَرَ (istakbara) — "he was arrogant"**

Root: **ك-ب-ر** (greatness). Remove the اِسْتَ prefix → the remaining letters ك-ب-ر are the root. Form X "deeming" meaning: he deemed himself great.

**2. اِسْتَعَانَ (istaʿāna) — "he sought help"**

Root: **ع-و-ن** (helping). Remove the اِسْتَ prefix → the visible letters are ع-ا-ن, but the long ā hides a weak middle root letter و. Original root: ع-و-ن. Form X "seeking" meaning: he sought help.

**3. يَسْتَخْفُونَ (yastakhfūna) — "they conceal"**

Root: **خ-ف-ي** (hidden). Remove the يَسْتَ present tense prefix → remaining root letters are خ-ف with weak final ي (hidden in the conjugation). Root: خ-ف-ي. Form X "seeking" meaning: they seek to be hidden.

**4. اِسْتَقَامَ (istaqāma) — "he was steadfast"**

Root: **ق-و-م** (standing). Remove the اِسْتَ prefix → the visible letters are ق-ا-م, but the long ā hides the weak middle root letter و. Original root: ق-و-م. Form X "finding oneself in a state" meaning: he established himself firmly.

**5. اِسْتَبَقَ (istabaqa) — "he raced"**

Root: **س-ب-ق** (preceding). Remove the اِسْتَ prefix → the remaining letters س-ب-ق are the root. Form X "seeking" meaning: he sought to precede.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Meaning Prediction — Given the root and Form X, predict the meaning.">

**1. Root: ع-ل-م (knowing). Form X: اِسْتَعْلَمَ (istaʿlama). What does it mean?**

"He sought to know" or "he inquired / asked for information." Form X's seeking meaning turns "knowing" into "seeking knowledge" — making an inquiry or investigation.

**2. Root: ن-ص-ر (helping/victory). Form X: اِسْتَنْصَرَ (istanṣara). What does it mean?**

"He sought help/victory" or "he asked for support." Form X turns "helping" into "seeking help" — requesting assistance or calling for reinforcement.

**3. Root: ح-ي-ي (life). Form X: اِسْتَحْيَا (istaḥyā). What does it mean?**

"He felt shy / was modest." This is an example of the "finding oneself in a state" meaning — the subject experiences a sense of modesty or shame. This verb appears in the Quran: إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ لَا يَسْتَحْىِۦٓ أَن يَضْرِبَ مَثَلًۭا "Indeed, Allah is not shy to present an example" (Al-Baqarah 2:26).

**4. Root: ك-ث-ر (abundance). Form X: اِسْتَكْثَرَ (istakthara). What does it mean?**

"He deemed much / considered it too much" or "he sought more." Form X's deeming meaning: he considered the quantity to be large or excessive.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Quranic Form Identification — Identify the verb form (VII, VIII, IX, or X) and root for each.">

**1. ٱسْتَغْفِرْ لَنَا ذُنُوبَنَآ — "Ask forgiveness for our sins" [Yusuf 12:97]**

Form: **X** (imperative). Root: غ-ف-ر (forgiving). Pattern: اِسْتَفْعِلْ (istafʿil). The اِسْتَ prefix is the Form X marker. Meaning: "seek forgiveness" — requesting the root action.

**2. يَوْمَ تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ — "The Day some faces will turn white" [Al 'Imran 3:106]**

Form: **IX** (present tense). Root: ب-ي-ض (whiteness). Pattern: تَفْعَلُّ (tafʿallu). The doubled final letter (ـضُّ with shadda) signals Form IX. Meaning: "it turns white" — becoming a color.

**3. فَٱنطَلَقَ ٱلْمَلَأُ — "Then the eminent ones departed" [Sad 38:6]**

Form: **VII** (past tense). Root: ط-ل-ق (releasing). Pattern: اِنْفَعَلَ (infaʿala). The اِنْ prefix (visible after فَـ conjunction) signals Form VII. Meaning: "they set out" — reflexive motion.

**4. ٱلَّذِينَ ٱسْتَكْبَرُوا۟ — "Those who were arrogant" [Al-A'raf 7:75]**

Form: **X** (past tense). Root: ك-ب-ر (greatness). Pattern: اِسْتَفْعَلُوا (istafʿalū). The اِسْتَ prefix signals Form X. Meaning: "they deemed themselves great" — deeming/considering function.

**5. فَٱخْتَلَفَ ٱلْأَحْزَابُ — "Then the factions differed" [Maryam 19:37]**

Form: **VIII** (past tense). Root: خ-ل-ف (coming after/differing). Pattern: اِفْتَعَلَ (iftaʿala). The اِ prefix + infixed تَ between خ and ل signals Form VIII. Meaning: "they differed" — each going their own way.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 5: The 10-Form Challenge — Given the root ع-ل-م (knowing/knowledge), show how it appears in six different forms and explain the meaning shift.">

**Root ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) means "knowing, knowledge." Here is how it looks across six commonly used forms:**

**Form I: عَلِمَ (ʿalima) — "he knew"**
- Pattern: فَعِلَ
- Meaning: basic action — simple state of knowing
- Quranic: وَٱللَّهُ يَعْلَمُ وَأَنتُمْ لَا تَعْلَمُونَ "And Allah knows while you do not know" (Al-Baqarah 2:216)

**Form II: عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "he taught"**
- Pattern: فَعَّلَ (doubled middle)
- Meaning: causative — he caused someone to know = he taught
- Quranic: عَلَّمَ ٱلْإِنسَٰنَ مَا لَمْ يَعْلَمْ "He taught man what he did not know" (Al-Alaq 96:5)

**Form IV: أَعْلَمَ (aʿlama) — "he informed / notified"**
- Pattern: أَفْعَلَ (hamza prefix)
- Meaning: simple causative — he made someone aware, announced
- Usage: less common than Form II in Quran but used in Classical Arabic

**Form V: تَعَلَّمَ (taʿallama) — "he learned"**
- Pattern: تَفَعَّلَ (تَ prefix + doubled middle)
- Meaning: reflexive of Form II — he taught himself = he learned
- Quranic concept: learning is the reflexive of teaching

**Form VIII: اِعْتَلَمَ (iʿtalama) — rare, but root usage in Form VIII appears as:**
- The Form VIII of this root is uncommon. However, the concept of "knowing with effort" exists in the system.

**Form X: اِسْتَعْلَمَ (istaʿlama) — "he inquired / sought knowledge"**
- Pattern: اِسْتَفْعَلَ (اِسْتَ prefix)
- Meaning: seeking the root action — he sought to know = he made an inquiry
- Usage: common in Classical Arabic for formal inquiry

**The semantic progression:**

| Form | Verb | Meaning | Direction |
|------|------|---------|-----------|
| I | عَلِمَ | "he knew" | Internal state |
| II | عَلَّمَ | "he taught" | Outward (causing others to know) |
| IV | أَعْلَمَ | "he informed" | Outward (making someone aware) |
| V | تَعَلَّمَ | "he learned" | Inward (teaching oneself) |
| X | اِسْتَعْلَمَ | "he inquired" | Outward seeking (requesting knowledge) |

Notice the beautiful logic: Form I is the base state. Form II directs knowledge outward (teaching). Form V turns it back inward (learning). Form X seeks it from outside (inquiring). The Arabic verb system is not random — it is deeply systematic.

## Summary

You have now completed all ten Arabic verb forms. This is a major milestone in your study of Quranic Arabic morphology.

**Form IX — اِفْعَلَّ (ifʿalla):**
- **Marker:** اِ prefix + doubled final root letter (shadda)
- **Present tense:** يَفْعَلُّ (yafʿallu)
- **Meaning:** Becoming a color or acquiring a physical quality
- **Frequency:** Extremely rare — the rarest of all ten forms
- **Key example:** اِحْمَرَّ (iḥmarra) "it became red"
- **Quranic appearance:** تَبْيَضُّ وُجُوهٌ وَتَسْوَدُّ وُجُوهٌ (Al 'Imran 3:106)

**Form X — اِسْتَفْعَلَ (istafʿala):**
- **Marker:** اِسْتَ prefix — the longest and most distinctive marker
- **Present tense:** يَسْتَفْعِلُ (yastafʿilu)
- **Meaning:** Seeking/requesting, deeming/considering, or finding oneself in a state
- **Frequency:** Fairly common — appears regularly throughout the Quran
- **Key examples:** اِسْتَغْفَرَ "he sought forgiveness," اِسْتَعَانَ "he sought help," اِسْتَكْبَرَ "he was arrogant," اِسْتَقَامَ "he was steadfast"

**Recognition for Forms VII-X (all start with اِ):**
1. اِسْتَ → **Form X** (seeking/requesting)
2. اِنْ → **Form VII** (passive/reflexive)
3. اِ + doubled final → **Form IX** (colors/defects)
4. اِ + consonant + تَ → **Form VIII** (reflexive/effortful)

<Callout type="tip" title="Milestone: You can now identify ALL 10 Arabic verb forms">
This is a significant achievement. With Forms I through X mastered, you have the complete morphological framework for recognizing any Arabic verb you encounter in the Quran. Every verb in the Quran — no matter how unfamiliar — follows one of these ten patterns. When you see a new verb:

1. Check its prefix and internal structure against the 10-form chart
2. Identify the form number
3. Extract the root by removing the form markers
4. Predict the meaning using the form's core function + the root meaning

This system is the backbone of Arabic morphology. You now own it.
</Callout>

**Next steps:** In [L3.19 Active & Passive Participles](/learn/level-3/19-active-passive-participles/), you'll learn how EVERY verb form (I through X) derives participles using predictable patterns. The active participle (doer) and passive participle (thing done) of each form follow systematic rules — and knowing all ten forms gives you the complete foundation to master them. This is the final piece of the morphological puzzle.
