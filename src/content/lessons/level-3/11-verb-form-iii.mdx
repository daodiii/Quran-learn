## Introduction

In [L3.10 Verb Form II](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii), you learned how doubling the middle letter creates causative and intensive meanings. Now you'll discover another transformation: inserting a long vowel to create INTERACTIVE action — action directed toward someone or done WITH someone.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يُرِيدُونَ أَن يُطْفِئُوا نُورَ ٱللَّهِ بِأَفْوَٰهِهِمْ وَيَأْبَى ٱللَّهُ إِلَّآ أَن يُتِمَّ نُورَهُۥ وَلَوْ كَرِهَ ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ"
  transliteration="yurīdūna an yuṭfiʾū nūra llāhi bi-afwāhihim wa-yaʾbā llāhu illā an yutimma nūrahu wa-law kariha l-kāfirūna"
  translation="They want to extinguish the light of Allah with their mouths, but Allah refuses except to perfect His light, although the disbelievers dislike it"
  reference="At-Tawbah 9:32"
  highlight="كَرِهَ"
/>

Look at a related root ق-ت-ل (q-t-l) "killing." The Form I verb قَتَلَ (qatala) means "he killed" — a simple, one-directional action. But if you want to say "he fought," you need a form that shows RECIPROCAL action — action exchanged between two parties. That's where Form III comes in: قَاتَلَ (qātala).

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَقَاتِلُوا فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ"
  transliteration="wa-qātilū fī sabīli llāhi lladhīna yuqātilūnakum"
  translation="Fight in the cause of Allah those who fight you"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:190"
  highlight="قَاتِلُوا,يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ"
/>

Notice قَاتِلُوا (qātilū) "fight" and يُقَاتِلُونَ (yuqātilūna) "they fight" — both Form III. The long ā after ق transforms simple killing into mutual combat.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize the Form III pattern (fāʿala / فَاعَلَ) with alif after the first root letter
- Understand Form III's reciprocal and competitive meanings
- Identify Form III verbs in Quranic text and explain the semantic shift from Form I
- Learn representative conjugation forms for Form III verbs

**Connection to previous learning:** Like [Form II](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii), Form III modifies the base [Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i) pattern. But instead of doubling the middle letter, Form III STRETCHES the verb by inserting a long vowel (ā) after the first root letter. This creates interactive meaning.

**Forward connection:** Form III is the foundation for [Form VI](/learn/level-3/verb-form-vi), which adds تَ prefix to Form III for reflexive/reciprocal meaning (تَفَاعَلَ). Understanding Form III's "interactive" nature now prepares you for the entire family of reciprocal verb forms.

## Understanding Form III

**Plain English first:** Form III makes an action INTERACTIVE. If Form I is just "doing" something, Form III is "doing it WITH someone" or "doing it TOWARD someone." The action has a second party — it's not done in isolation, it's directed or shared.

Think of these English pairs:
- "kill" → "fight (against)" — killing becomes mutual combat
- "write" → "correspond with" — writing becomes exchange of letters
- "precede" → "race (with)" — preceding becomes competitive running
- "sit" → "sit with, accompany" — sitting becomes companionship

In English, we often use different verbs or add prepositions. In Arabic, you insert one letter (alif ا) after the first root letter, and the meaning shifts to "interactive."

**The Form III pattern: فَاعَلَ (fāʿala)**

The template فَاعَلَ shows the Form III structure:
- **ف** (fa) = position of the FIRST root letter
- **ا** (ā) = LONG ALIF inserted after first root letter (THE Form III marker)
- **ع** (ʿa) = position of the SECOND root letter
- **ل** (la) = position of the THIRD root letter

**Visual pattern breakdown:**

```
Root: ق-ت-ل (q-t-l) "killing"

Form I pattern:  فَعَلَ  →  قَتَلَ  "he killed"
                 (3 letters, no insertion)

Form III pattern: فَاعَلَ  →  قَاتَلَ  "he fought"
                  (long ا inserted after ق)
```

The alif (ا) between ق and ت is the KEY identifier for Form III. It stretches the verb and transforms the meaning from simple action to interactive/directed action.

### The Core Meanings of Form III

Form III expresses action that involves another party. Three main nuances:

**1. Reciprocal — "doing the action WITH someone (mutually)"**

The action is exchanged between two parties, back and forth.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form III: Reciprocal Transformation"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form III", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["ك-ت-ب", "كَتَبَ", "he wrote", "كَاتَبَ", "he corresponded with"],
    ["ق-ت-ل", "قَتَلَ", "he killed", "قَاتَلَ", "he fought (with/against)"],
    ["س-ل-م", "سَلِمَ", "he was safe", "سَالَمَ", "he made peace with"],
    ["ع-ه-د", "عَهِدَ", "he pledged", "عَاهَدَ", "he made covenant with"]
  ]}
/>

**2. Attempted/Directed action — "trying to do the action to someone"**

Form III can express ATTEMPTING or STRIVING to do the action toward another.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form III: Attempted Action"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form III", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["خ-د-ع", "خَدَعَ", "he deceived", "خَادَعَ", "he tried to deceive"],
    ["غ-ل-ب", "غَلَبَ", "he overcame", "غَالَبَ", "he tried to overcome"],
    ["ج-ه-د", "جَهَدَ", "he exerted effort", "جَاهَدَ", "he strove against"],
    ["ح-ك-م", "حَكَمَ", "he judged", "حَاكَمَ", "he brought to trial"]
  ]}
/>

**3. Competitive action — "doing the action IN COMPETITION"**

Form III can emphasize the competitive, adversarial nature of an action.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Form I → Form III: Competitive Transformation"
  headers={["Root", "Form I", "Meaning", "Form III", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["س-ب-ق", "سَبَقَ", "he preceded", "سَابَقَ", "he raced (with)"],
    ["ج-ل-س", "جَلَسَ", "he sat", "جَالَسَ", "he sat with, kept company"],
    ["ن-ف-س", "نَفَسَ", "he breathed", "نَافَسَ", "he competed"],
    ["ص-ر-ع", "صَرَعَ", "he threw down", "صَارَعَ", "he wrestled"]
  ]}
/>

### Arabic Terminology

**Form III** — [Mufāʿalah](/resources/glossary#mufalah) (mufāʿalah / مُفَاعَلَةٌ)

The term مُفَاعَلَةٌ (mufāʿalatun) means "mutual action, interaction, reciprocity." This form is called مُفَاعَلَةٌ because its verbal noun pattern is مُفَاعَلَةٌ (e.g., مُقَاتَلَةٌ muqātalatun "fighting" from قَاتَلَ).

**Interactive action** — [Mushārakah](/resources/glossary#musharakah) (mushārakah / مُشَارَكَةٌ)

The concept of "participation, sharing in action" is called مُشَارَكَةٌ (mushārakatun), from root ش-ر-ك "to share."

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Form III verbs from Surah Al-Mumtahanah and related surahs.

### Example 1: قَاتَلُوكُمْ — "They fought you"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَّا يَنْهَىٰكُمُ ٱللَّهُ عَنِ ٱلَّذِينَ لَمْ يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ فِى ٱلدِّينِ وَلَمْ يُخْرِجُوكُم مِّن دِيَٰرِكُمْ أَن تَبَرُّوهُمْ وَتُقْسِطُوٓا إِلَيْهِمْ"
  transliteration="lā yanhākumu llāhu ʿani lladhīna lam yuqātilūkum fī d-dīni wa-lam yukhrijūkum min diyārikum an tabarrūhum wa-tuqsiṭū ilayhim"
  translation="Allah does not forbid you from those who do not fight you because of religion and do not expel you from your homes - from being righteous toward them and acting justly toward them"
  reference="Al-Mumtahanah 60:8"
  highlight="يُقَٰتِلُوكُمْ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **يُقَاتِلُوكُمْ** (yuqātilūkum) — "they fight you"
  - **Root:** ق-ت-ل (q-t-l) "killing"
  - **Pattern:** يُفَاعِلٌُ (Form III present, third person masculine plural)
  - **Form III marker:** Alif (ا) after first root letter ق
  - **Function:** Present tense verb + subject (they) + object suffix كُمْ (you plural)
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I قَتَلَ "he killed" → Form III قَاتَلَ "he fought" (reciprocal killing)
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple killing → combat (interactive action)

**Form I comparison:**
- Form I: قَتَلَ (qatala) — "he killed" (one-directional, victim is passive)
- Form III: قَاتَلَ (qātala) — "he fought" (two-directional, both parties active)

The inserted alif transforms murder into combat. Fighting is mutual engagement — Form III captures this perfectly.

### Example 2: يُخَٰدِعُونَ — "They deceive"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يُخَٰدِعُونَ ٱللَّهَ وَٱلَّذِينَ ءَامَنُوا وَمَا يَخْدَعُونَ إِلَّآ أَنفُسَهُمْ وَمَا يَشْعُرُونَ"
  transliteration="yukhādiʿūna llāha wa-lladhīna āmanū wa-mā yakhdaʿūna illā anfusahum wa-mā yashʿurūna"
  translation="They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe, but they deceive not except themselves and perceive [it] not"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:9"
  highlight="يُخَٰدِعُونَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **يُخَادِعُونَ** (yukhādiʿūna) — "they [try to] deceive"
  - **Root:** خ-د-ع (kh-d-ʿ) "deception"
  - **Pattern:** يُفَاعِلٌُ (Form III present, third person masculine plural)
  - **Form III marker:** Alif (ا) after خ
  - **Function:** Present tense verb with embedded subject
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I خَدَعَ "he deceived" → Form III خَادَعَ "he tried to deceive, he attempted deception"
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple deception → attempted deception (directed but unsuccessful)

**Important semantic nuance:** The verse contrasts Form III يُخَادِعُونَ (they TRY to deceive) with Form I يَخْدَعُونَ (they [actually] deceive). Form III emphasizes the ATTEMPT or DIRECTED EFFORT, which may or may not succeed. They try to deceive Allah, but really they only deceive themselves.

### Example 3: جَاهِدُوا — "Strive, struggle"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَجَٰهِدُوا فِى ٱللَّهِ حَقَّ جِهَادِهِۦ"
  transliteration="wa-jāhidū fī llāhi ḥaqqa jihādihi"
  translation="And strive for Allah with the striving due to Him"
  reference="Al-Hajj 22:78"
  highlight="جَٰهِدُوا"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **جَاهِدُوا** (jāhidū) — "strive, struggle"
  - **Root:** ج-ه-د (j-h-d) "effort, striving"
  - **Pattern:** فَاعِلٌُوا (Form III imperative, second person masculine plural)
  - **Form III marker:** Alif (ا) after ج
  - **Function:** Command form addressing "you all"
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I جَهَدَ "he exerted effort" → Form III جَاهَدَ "he strove against/with"
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple effort → directed struggle (against obstacles or with companions)

**Related word:** جِهَادٌ (jihādun) — "striving, struggle" (Form III verbal noun)

Form III adds the dimension of OPPOSITION or PARTNERSHIP — striving isn't done in isolation, it's done AGAINST something or WITH someone.

### Example 4: عَاهَدتُّمْ — "You made covenant"

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِلَّا ٱلَّذِينَ عَٰهَدتُّم مِّنَ ٱلْمُشْرِكِينَ ثُمَّ لَمْ يَنقُصُوكُمْ شَيْـًٔا"
  transliteration="illā lladhīna ʿāhadtum mina l-mushrikīna thumma lam yanquṣūkum shayʾan"
  translation="Excepted are those with whom you made a treaty among the polytheists and then they have not been deficient toward you in anything"
  reference="At-Tawbah 9:4"
  highlight="عَٰهَدتُّم"
/>

**Morphological analysis:**

- **عَاهَدتُّمْ** (ʿāhadtum) — "you made covenant"
  - **Root:** ع-ه-د (ʿ-h-d) "covenant, pledge"
  - **Pattern:** فَاعَلَ (Form III past, second person masculine plural)
  - **Form III marker:** Alif (ا) after ع
  - **Function:** Past tense verb with plural subject suffix تُمْ
  - **Semantic shift:** Form I عَهِدَ "he pledged" → Form III عَاهَدَ "he made covenant with"
  - **Meaning transformation:** Simple pledge → mutual covenant (reciprocal commitment)

**Form I comparison:**
- Form I: عَهِدَ (ʿahida) — "he pledged" (personal commitment)
- Form III: عَاهَدَ (ʿāhada) — "he made covenant with" (mutual binding agreement)

Covenants are BY NATURE reciprocal — two parties binding themselves mutually. Form III perfectly expresses this interactive meaning.

## Form III Conjugation

Form III conjugates using the same suffix pattern as Forms I and II. Only the stem changes — the long ā after the first root letter remains throughout.

### Representative Past Tense Conjugation

We'll show 8 representative persons to illustrate the pattern:

<VerbConjugation
  root="ق-ت-ل"
  form="Form III"
  pattern="فَاعَلَ"
  headers={["Person", "Arabic", "Transliteration", "Translation"]}
  rows={[
    ["هُوَ (he)", "قَاتَلَ", "qātala", "he fought"],
    ["هِيَ (she)", "قَاتَلَتْ", "qātalat", "she fought"],
    ["هُمْ (they m)", "قَاتَلُوا", "qātalū", "they (m) fought"],
    ["أَنْتَ (you m)", "قَاتَلْتَ", "qātalta", "you (m) fought"],
    ["أَنْتِ (you f)", "قَاتَلْتِ", "qātalti", "you (f) fought"],
    ["أَنَا (I)", "قَاتَلْتُ", "qātaltu", "I fought"],
    ["نَحْنُ (we)", "قَاتَلْنَا", "qātalnā", "we fought"],
    ["أَنْتُمْ (you pl)", "قَاتَلْتُمْ", "qātaltum", "you (pl) fought"]
  ]}
/>

**Key observations:**

1. **The stem قَاتَلْ remains constant** — the long ā after ق never changes
2. **Suffixes are identical to Forms I and II**
3. **Conjugation pattern:** قَاتَلْ + suffix

**Present tense stem:** يُفَاعِلٌُ pattern (damma-kasra vowels):
- يُقَاتِلُ (yuqātilu) "he fights"
- تُقَاتِلُ (tuqātilu) "she fights"
- نُقَاتِلُ (nuqātilu) "we fight"

**Note:** Full conjugation follows the same pattern. See [L3.03](/learn/level-3/past-tense) for complete suffix system.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Form III: The Inserted-Alif Pattern">

**Form III** (فَاعَلَ / fāʿala) is characterized by:

### Pattern Structure

**Past tense:** فَاعَلَ (CāCaCa) — LONG ALIF (ا) inserted after first root letter

**Template application:**
- Root ق-ت-ل + Form III pattern فَاعَلَ = قَاتَلَ "he fought"
- Root ك-ت-ب + Form III pattern فَاعَلَ = كَاتَبَ "he corresponded"

### Core Meaning: Interactive Action

Form III makes action INTERACTIVE — directed toward someone or done WITH someone:

1. **Reciprocal** — mutual action exchanged between two parties
   - قَتَلَ "he killed" → قَاتَلَ "he fought" (mutual killing)

2. **Attempted** — trying to do the action to someone
   - خَدَعَ "he deceived" → خَادَعَ "he tried to deceive"

3. **Competitive** — doing the action in competition
   - سَبَقَ "he preceded" → سَابَقَ "he raced"

### Form III Identification

**✓ Check for:** Long alif (ا) inserted AFTER first root letter
**✓ Past pattern:** فَاعَلَ with fatha-fatha vowels
**✓ Present pattern:** يُفَاعِلٌُ with damma-kasra vowels

**Related lessons:**
- [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i) — Base form for comparison
- [L3.10 Verb Form II](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii) — Doubled-middle pattern
- [L3.14 Verb Form VI](/learn/level-3/verb-form-vi) — Reflexive of Form III (تَفَاعَلَ)

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Mistake 1: Confusing Form III alif with other alifs**

Not every alif in a verb is Form III! Check that it comes AFTER the first root letter and BEFORE the second.

**Test:** Remove the alif. Do you get a 3-letter root?
- قَاتَلَ → ق-ت-ل (root exists) → This IS Form III ✓
- قَالَ → ق-ل (only 2 letters) → This is NOT Form III (weak verb with و or ي)

**Mistake 2: Confusing Form III with active participle**

Active participle (فَاعِلٌ) looks similar to Form III but has different voweling:
- Form III verb: قَاتَلَ (qātala) — past tense, fatha-fatha
- Active participle: قَاتِلٌ (qātilun) — "one who kills/fighter," kasra on second root

Context and vowels distinguish them.

**Mistake 3: Assuming all Form III verbs are reciprocal**

Form III has THREE meanings: reciprocal, attempted, and competitive. Context determines which.

- قَاتَلَ — reciprocal ("fought" = mutual killing)
- خَادَعَ — attempted ("tried to deceive")
- سَابَقَ — competitive ("raced" = competed in speed)

Don't automatically translate every Form III as "did mutually" — check the context.

**Mistake 4: Forgetting the preposition**

Form III often requires a preposition to show the other party:
- قَاتَلَ + مَعَ (maʿa) — "fought WITH"
- قَاتَلَ + ضِدَّ (ḍidda) — "fought AGAINST"  
- جَاهَدَ + فِي (fī) — "strove IN/FOR"

The interactive meaning implies another party, which is often expressed by a preposition.

**Mistake 5: Missing the alif lengthening**

The alif (ا) is ESSENTIAL for Form III. Without it, you have Form I:

- قَتَلَ (qatala) — Form I "he killed"
- قَاتَلَ (qātala) — Form III "he fought"

The long ā sound (marked by alif) distinguishes the forms. Listen for the lengthening!

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify which of these verbs is Form III. Explain your reasoning: (a) كَتَبَ (kataba), (b) كَاتَبَ (kātaba), (c) نَصَرَ (naṣara), (d) نَاصَرَ (nāṣara)">

**Answer:**

**(a) كَتَبَ (kataba) — ✗ NOT Form III**

**Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"

**Analysis:**
- No alif inserted between root letters
- Pattern: فَعَلَ (CaCaCa) — Form I
- Meaning: "he wrote" (simple action)

**Conclusion:** This is Form I, the base form.

**(b) كَاتَبَ (kātaba) — ✓ Form III**

**Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"

**Analysis:**
- Long alif (ا) inserted after first root letter ك
- Pattern: فَاعَلَ (CāCaCa) — Form III
- Semantic shift: Form I كَتَبَ "he wrote" → Form III كَاتَبَ "he corresponded with"
- Meaning type: Reciprocal (exchanged letters back and forth)

**Conclusion:** This IS Form III. The inserted alif makes writing reciprocal — correspondence.

**(c) نَصَرَ (naṣara) — ✗ NOT Form III**

**Root:** ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r) "help, victory"

**Analysis:**
- No alif inserted
- Pattern: فَعَلَ (CaCaCa) — Form I
- Meaning: "he helped" (simple assistance)

**Conclusion:** This is Form I. Form III from this root would be نَاصَرَ (nāṣara).

**(d) نَاصَرَ (nāṣara) — ✓ Form III**

**Root:** ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r) "help, victory"

**Analysis:**
- Long alif (ا) inserted after ن
- Pattern: فَاعَلَ (CāCaCa) — Form III
- Semantic shift: Form I نَصَرَ "he helped" → Form III نَاصَرَ "he fought alongside, supported in battle"
- Meaning type: Reciprocal/collaborative (helping WITH someone in struggle)

**Conclusion:** This IS Form III. The alif transforms simple help into collaborative combat support.

**Summary:** (b) كَاتَبَ and (d) نَاصَرَ are Form III. The others are Form I.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Form I سَبَقَ means 'he preceded.' What does Form III سَابَقَ mean? Explain the semantic shift and identify which Form III meaning type applies.">

**Answer:**

**Form III meaning:** سَابَقَ (sābaqa) — "he raced (with), he competed in speed"

**Semantic shift:**
- **Form I:** سَبَقَ (sabaqa) — "he preceded, he surpassed" (simple position — being ahead)
- **Form III:** سَابَقَ (sābaqa) — "he raced with, he competed" (competitive action — trying to be ahead)

**Type of Form III meaning:** **Competitive**

Form III takes the simple concept of "being first" and makes it COMPETITIVE — you're not just ahead, you're actively RACING to be ahead. Racing requires an opponent — Form III captures this perfectly.

**Semantic transformation:**
- Form I: static position (someone IS ahead)
- Form III: dynamic competition (someone STRIVES to be ahead against another)

**Quranic example context:**
While سَابَقَ itself doesn't appear frequently, related competitive verbs like Form VIII اِسْتَبَقَ (istabaqaa) "they raced" appear in narrative contexts (e.g., Yusuf's brothers racing to the door).

**Related Form III verbs showing competition:**
- غَالَبَ (ghālaba) — "he tried to overcome, competed"
- نَافَسَ (nāfasa) — "he competed, vied"
- صَارَعَ (ṣāraʿa) — "he wrestled"

All express the INTERACTIVE, COMPETITIVE nature that Form III adds to base actions.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Identify the Form III verb in this verse: 'وَقَاتِلُوا فِى سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلَّذِينَ يُقَٰتِلُونَكُمْ' [Al-Baqarah 2:190]. Extract the root, explain the Form III marker, and compare with Form I.">

**Answer:**

**Form III verbs:** قَاتِلُوا (qātilū) and يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ (yuqātilūnakum)

**Focusing on the first:** قَاتِلُوا (qātilū) — "fight"

**Root extraction:**
- Imperative form: فَاعِلٌُوا
- Remove plural imperative suffix ـُوا
- Remaining: قَاتِلْ
- Root letters: ق-ت-ل (q-t-l)
- Root meaning: "killing"

**Form III marker:**
- Long alif (ا) inserted after first root letter ق
- This is THE distinctive marker of Form III
- Written: قَاتَلَ (with ا between ق and ت)
- Pattern: فَاعَلَ (CāCaCa)

**Comparison with Form I:**

| Form | Verb | Pattern | Meaning | Nature |
|------|------|---------|---------|--------|
| Form I | قَتَلَ | فَعَلَ | "he killed" | One-directional, victim passive |
| Form III | قَاتَلَ | فَاعَلَ | "he fought" | Reciprocal, both parties active |

**Meaning transformation:**

Form I قَتَلَ is SIMPLE killing — one person kills another, who cannot respond. Form III قَاتَلَ is FIGHTING — both parties are actively trying to kill each other. Combat is mutual engagement.

**Second verb in verse:** يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ (yuqātilūnakum) — "they fight you"
- Present tense Form III with subject (they) + object suffix (you)
- Same root, same Form III pattern in present tense
- Shows reciprocal nature: "those who fight YOU" — the fighting is directed at you specifically

**Verse structure:**
"Fight (قَاتِلُوا) those who fight you (يُقَاتِلُونَكُمْ)"

Both verbs are Form III, emphasizing the RECIPROCAL nature of combat — you fight those fighting you, not initiators of aggression but respondents.

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Compare Form II عَلَّمَ (doubled middle) with hypothetical Form III عَالَمَ (inserted alif). What would be the difference in meaning? (Note: عَالَمَ is not commonly used, but the comparison helps understand the forms.)">

**Answer:**

**Root:** ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"

**Form II: عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) — "he taught"**

**Pattern:** فَعَّلَ (doubled middle letter ل)

**Meaning type:** Causative
- Form I عَلِمَ "he knew" (had knowledge)
- Form II عَلَّمَ "he taught" (caused someone to know)

**Semantic focus:** The CAUSATION — making someone HAVE knowledge

**Hypothetical Form III: عَالَمَ (ʿālama)**

**Pattern:** فَاعَلَ (alif after first letter ع)

**Expected meaning type:** Interactive/Reciprocal

**What it WOULD mean:** "he exchanged knowledge with, he discussed with, he studied together with"

**Semantic focus:** The INTERACTION — sharing knowledge mutually, not one-way transmission

**Key difference:**

| Form | Pattern | Focus | Direction | Example scenario |
|------|---------|-------|-----------|------------------|
| Form II عَلَّمَ | فَعَّلَ | Causation | Teacher → Student (one-way) | "He taught the student" (caused knowledge) |
| Form III عَالَمَ | فَاعَلَ | Interaction | Scholar ↔ Scholar (two-way) | "He discussed with the scholar" (exchanged knowledge) |

**Why Form III is rare here:**

In practice, Arabic uses عَلَّمَ (Form II) for teaching because teaching is typically understood as one-directional causation. For mutual learning/discussion, Arabic uses other verbs:
- تَعَلَّمَ (Form V) — "he learned" (reflexive of Form II)
- تَدَارَسَ (Form VI) — "he studied with" (reflexive of Form III from د-ر-س)

**General principle:**

- **Form II** = "I CAUSE you to do the action" (one-way causation)
- **Form III** = "I do the action WITH/TOWARD you" (two-way interaction)

This comparison shows why understanding EACH form's core meaning helps predict verb semantics across roots!
