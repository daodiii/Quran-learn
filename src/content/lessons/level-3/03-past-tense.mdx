## Introduction

When Allah describes His act of granting, Surah Al-Kawthar opens with a profound declaration:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have given you [O Muhammad] al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَاكَ"
/>

The verb **أَعْطَيْنَاكَ** (aʿṭaynāka) "We gave you" shows the past tense in action. Look at the suffix **نَا** (nā) at the end — this tells you WHO performed the action: "we." Without even seeing a pronoun, you know the subject is "we" because of that two-letter suffix. That's the power of Arabic verb conjugation.

Every Arabic verb can take 14 different forms to show exactly who performed the action — he, she, they (masculine), they (feminine), you (masculine), you (feminine), I, we, and all the dual forms. Each person gets its own unique suffix pattern. Once you master these 14 conjugations, you'll be able to identify the subject of any past tense verb in the Quran instantly.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Learn all 14 past tense conjugations for Form I verbs
- Recognize the suffix patterns that tell you WHO did the action
- Conjugate simple Form I verbs in past tense
- Identify past tense verbs in Quranic verses with morphological analysis

**Connection to previous learning:** In [L3.02 Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you learned that فَعَلَ (faʿala) is the basic Form I pattern. That form — "he did" — is actually the third person masculine singular past tense. It's the citation form, the dictionary form. Now you'll learn ALL 14 conjugations built from that same root pattern.

**Forward connection:** This lesson prepares you for [L3.04 Present Tense Conjugation](/learn/level-3/present-tense), where you'll learn how present tense uses PREFIXES as well as suffixes. It also prepares you for [L3.06 Subject Pronouns](/learn/level-3/subject-pronouns), where you'll study the independent pronouns (أَنَا, أَنْتَ, هُوَ) that correspond to these conjugations.

## Understanding Past Tense Conjugation

**Plain English first:** Past tense in Arabic is formed by adding suffixes to the verb stem. The stem stays exactly the same — only the ending changes to tell you WHO performed the action. Think of the stem as the core meaning (the root + pattern), and the suffix as the label that identifies the subject.

English does something similar but far less precisely. We say "I played, you played, he played, they played" — English verbs barely change at all. The subject pronoun carries most of the information. Arabic is different: each person gets a UNIQUE suffix, so you always know EXACTLY who did the action, even without stating a pronoun explicitly.

**Arabic terminology:** The past tense is called [al-fiʿl al-māḍī](/resources/glossary#madi) (al-fiʿl al-māḍī / ٱلْفِعْلُ ٱلْمَاضِيْ) — literally "the verb that passed" or "the completed verb." It indicates actions that have been completed in the past, whether recent or distant.

### The Complete 14-Person Paradigm

Let's see all 14 conjugations using the root **ك-ت-ب** (ka-ta-ba) "to write," one of the most common Form I patterns:

<VerbConjugation
  root="ك ت ب"
  form="Form I"
  pattern="فَعَلَ"
  headers={["Person", "Arabic", "Transliteration", "Translation"]}
  rows={[
    ["هُوَ (he)", "كَتَبَ", "kataba", "he wrote"],
    ["هِيَ (she)", "كَتَبَتْ", "katabat", "she wrote"],
    ["هُمَا (they two - m)", "كَتَبَا", "katabā", "they (two males) wrote"],
    ["هُمَا (they two - f)", "كَتَبَتَا", "katabatā", "they (two females) wrote"],
    ["هُمْ (they - m)", "كَتَبُوْا", "katabū", "they (males) wrote"],
    ["هُنَّ (they - f)", "كَتَبْنَ", "katabna", "they (females) wrote"],
    ["أَنْتَ (you - m)", "كَتَبْتَ", "katabta", "you (male) wrote"],
    ["أَنْتِ (you - f)", "كَتَبْتِ", "katabti", "you (female) wrote"],
    ["أَنْتُمَا (you two)", "كَتَبْتُمَا", "katabtumā", "you (two) wrote"],
    ["أَنْتُمْ (you - m pl)", "كَتَبْتُمْ", "katabtum", "you (males) wrote"],
    ["أَنْتُنَّ (you - f pl)", "كَتَبْتُنَّ", "katabtunna", "you (females) wrote"],
    ["أَنَا (I)", "كَتَبْتُ", "katabtu", "I wrote"],
    ["نَحْنُ (we)", "كَتَبْنَا", "katabnā", "we wrote"],
  ]}
/>

**Key observation:** Notice the pattern:
- The root letters **ك-ت-ب** stay constant in every conjugation
- The vowel pattern **fatha-fatha** (ـَ ـَ) on the first two root letters stays the same
- Only the SUFFIX changes to mark the person, gender, and number

### Understanding the Suffix Patterns

The suffixes fall into two major groups:

**Group 1: Third-person suffixes (he/she/they)**

These suffixes attach directly to the base form:

<GrammarTable>
| Person | Suffix | Example (ك-ت-ب) | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| He (3rd m sg) | ـَ | كَتَبَ | Base form - just final fatha |
| She (3rd f sg) | ـَتْ | كَتَبَتْ | Tā marbūṭa + sukūn |
| They dual (m) | ـَا | كَتَبَا | Alif suffix |
| They dual (f) | ـَتَا | كَتَبَتَا | Tā + alif |
| They plural (m) | ـُوْا | كَتَبُوْا | Waw + alif (damma on waw) |
| They plural (f) | ـْنَ | كَتَبْنَ | Nūn with fatha |
</GrammarTable>

**Group 2: First/second-person suffixes (I/you/we)**

All of these suffixes begin with the letter **تَ** (tā) and cause a sukūn on the middle root letter:

<GrammarTable>
| Person | Suffix | Example (ك-ت-ب) | Notes |
|--------|--------|-----------------|-------|
| You (2nd m sg) | ـْتَ | كَتَبْتَ | Sukūn on middle letter + تَ |
| You (2nd f sg) | ـْتِ | كَتَبْتِ | Sukūn + تِ (kasra) |
| You (2nd dual) | ـْتُمَا | كَتَبْتُمَا | Sukūn + تُمَا |
| You (2nd m pl) | ـْتُمْ | كَتَبْتُمْ | Sukūn + تُمْ |
| You (2nd f pl) | ـْتُنَّ | كَتَبْتُنَّ | Sukūn + تُنَّ (doubled nūn) |
| I (1st sg) | ـْتُ | كَتَبْتُ | Sukūn + تُ (damma) |
| We (1st pl) | ـْنَا | كَتَبْنَا | Sukūn + نَا |
</GrammarTable>

**Critical insight:** When you see a past tense verb starting with **تَ**, it's NOT about tense — it's about person. The تَ is the first/second person marker. Third person forms (he/she/they) don't have this prefix-like تَ.

Another critical pattern: Notice the sukūn (ـْ) on the middle root letter in all first/second person forms. Compare:
- **كَتَبَ** (kataba) "he wrote" — middle letter has fatha
- **كَتَبْتُ** (katabtu) "I wrote" — middle letter has sukūn

This sukūn shift is ESSENTIAL for correct pronunciation and recognition.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's see how past tense verbs appear in Quranic context, with complete morphological analysis:

**Example 1: First person plural "we"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have given you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="أَعْطَيْنَاكَ"
/>

**Morphological analysis of أَعْطَيْنَاكَ:**
- **Root:** ع-ط-ي (ʿayn-ṭā-yā) "to give"
- **Form:** Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern) — causative meaning
- **Tense:** Past (māḍī)
- **Person:** First person plural (we)
- **Suffix:** نَا (nā) "we" + ـكَ (ka) "you" object pronoun
- **Function:** Verb (fiʿl) with attached object pronoun

The verb shows past tense conjugation with the first person plural suffix **نَا** (nā), followed immediately by the attached pronoun **كَ** (ka) "you." This is common in Quranic Arabic — the verb carries both subject (through conjugation) and object (through suffix).

**Example 2: Third person masculine singular "he"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
/>

Though this verse contains imperatives (commands), let's examine a third person past tense example from nearby:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
  transliteration="inna shāniʾaka huwa l-abtar"
  translation="Indeed, your enemy - he is the one cut off"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:3"
/>

While this verse emphasizes the noun **شَانِئَكَ** (your enemy, an active participle), let's see a clear past tense example:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="خَلَقَ ٱلْإِنسَانَ مِنْ عَلَقٍ"
  transliteration="khalaqa l-insāna min ʿalaq"
  translation="He created man from a clinging substance"
  reference="Al-Alaq 96:2"
/>

**Morphological analysis of خَلَقَ:**
- **Root:** خ-ل-ق (khā-lām-qāf) "to create"
- **Form:** Form I (فَعَلَ pattern)
- **Tense:** Past (māḍī)
- **Person:** Third person masculine singular (he)
- **Suffix:** Final fatha (ـَ) — base form, no additional suffix
- **Function:** Verb (fiʿl) introducing a verbal sentence

This is the citation form — the base past tense from which all other conjugations derive.

**Example 3: Third person feminine singular "she"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قَدْ سَمِعَ ٱللَّهُ قَوْلَ ٱلَّتِي تُجَٰدِلُكَ فِي زَوْجِهَا"
  transliteration="qad samiʿa llāhu qawla llatī tujādiluka fī zawjihā"
  translation="Allah has certainly heard the speech of the one who argues with you concerning her husband"
  reference="Al-Mujadila 58:1"
/>

**Morphological analysis of سَمِعَ:**
- **Root:** س-م-ع (sīn-mīm-ʿayn) "to hear"
- **Form:** Form I (فَعِلَ pattern with kasra on middle letter)
- **Tense:** Past (māḍī)
- **Person:** Third person masculine singular (he)
- **Subject:** ٱللَّهُ (Allah) — nominative case (fāʿil)
- **Function:** Main verb of the sentence

Though this is masculine form, let's find a feminine example from a familiar surah:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="كَانَتْ مِنَ ٱلْقَٰنِتِينَ"
  transliteration="kānat mina l-qānitīn"
  translation="She was of the devoutly obedient"
  reference="At-Tahrim 66:12"
/>

**Morphological analysis of كَانَتْ:**
- **Root:** ك-و-ن (kāf-wāw-nūn) "to be"
- **Form:** Form I (defective verb)
- **Tense:** Past (māḍī)
- **Person:** Third person feminine singular (she)
- **Suffix:** ـَتْ (at) with sukūn on final tā
- **Function:** Verb "kaana" (one of the sisters of kaana)

The suffix **ـَتْ** clearly marks feminine gender.

**Example 4: Third person masculine plural "they"**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلَّذِينَ كَفَرُوا وَصَدُّوا عَن سَبِيلِ ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="alladhīna kafarū wa-ṣaddū ʿan sabīli llāh"
  translation="Those who disbelieved and turned away from the path of Allah"
  reference="Muhammad 47:1"
/>

**Morphological analysis of كَفَرُوْا:**
- **Root:** ك-ف-ر (kāf-fā-rā) "to disbelieve, to cover"
- **Form:** Form I (فَعَلَ pattern)
- **Tense:** Past (māḍī)
- **Person:** Third person masculine plural (they)
- **Suffix:** ـُوْا (ū) — waw with damma + alif
- **Function:** Verb modifying ٱلَّذِينَ (those who)

The suffix **ـُوْا** is one of the most common plural markers you'll encounter in the Quran.

**Example 5: Word-by-word breakdown**

Let's do a complete morphological breakdown of a short verse containing multiple past tense verbs:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ءَامَنَّا بِٱللَّهِ وَٱشْهَدْ بِأَنَّا مُسْلِمُونَ"
  transliteration="āmannā bi-llāhi wa-shhad bi-annā muslimūn"
  translation="We have believed in Allah, so bear witness that we are Muslims"
  reference="Al-Imran 3:52"
/>

**Word-by-word morphological analysis:**

| Word | Root | Form | Analysis |
|------|------|------|----------|
| ءَامَنَّا | ء-م-ن | Form IV | Past tense, 1st person plural "we" (نَا suffix), means "we believed" |
| بِٱللَّهِ | — | — | Preposition بِ + Allah in genitive case, means "in Allah" |
| وَٱشْهَدْ | ش-ه-د | Form I | Imperative (command), 2nd person singular "you", means "bear witness" |
| بِأَنَّا | — | — | Preposition بِ + particle أَنَّ + pronoun نَا, means "that we" |
| مُسْلِمُونَ | س-ل-م | Form IV | Active participle, masculine plural nominative, means "Muslims, ones who submit" |

Focus on **ءَامَنَّا** — the past tense verb:
- The root is ء-م-ن, but it's Form IV (أَفْعَلَ pattern), so it becomes **ءَامَنَ** in base form
- The first person plural suffix **نَا** is added: **ءَامَنَّا**
- Notice the shadda (doubling) on the نَ — this comes from the pattern, not the conjugation

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**Past Tense Conjugation Rules (al-Fiʿl al-Māḍī)**

1. **Base Form**: The third person masculine singular (he) is the base citation form: فَعَلَ

2. **Third Person Suffixes**: Add directly to the base form with vowels on the final root letter:
   - He: ـَ (fatha only)
   - She: ـَتْ (tā with sukūn)
   - They (dual m): ـَا (alif)
   - They (dual f): ـَتَا (tā + alif)
   - They (plural m): ـُوا (waw with damma + alif)
   - They (plural f): ـْنَ (nūn with fatha)

3. **First/Second Person Suffixes**: All begin with تَ and require sukūn on the middle root letter:
   - You (m): ـْتَ
   - You (f): ـْتِ
   - You (dual): ـْتُمَا
   - You (plural m): ـْتُمْ
   - You (plural f): ـْتُنَّ
   - I: ـْتُ
   - We: ـْنَا

4. **Sukūn Rule**: When adding first/second person suffixes, the middle root letter MUST take sukūn: كَتَبَ → كَتَبْتُ

5. **Root Preservation**: The three root letters remain in order. Only vowels and suffixes change.
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Common Mistakes in Past Tense Conjugation**

1. **Forgetting the sukūn**: Don't write كَتَبَتُ (katabatu) when you mean "I wrote." The correct form is كَتَبْتُ (katabtu) with sukūn on the middle letter. The sukūn distinguishes first/second person from third person.

2. **Confusing "they feminine" ـْنَ with present tense "they feminine"**: The past tense feminine plural suffix is ـْنَ (katabna), but the present tense is يَكْتُبْنَ (yaktubna) with a prefix. Context and vowel patterns will help you distinguish.

3. **Mixing up dual forms**: Don't confuse كَتَبَا (they two males wrote) with كَتَبَتَا (they two females wrote). The tā (ت) marks the feminine dual, just like it marks the singular feminine.

4. **Assuming all past tense verbs are Form I**: The conjugation patterns we learned here apply to ALL verb forms (I-X), not just Form I. The root and pattern determine meaning, but the suffixes work the same way. For example, Form IV أَعْطَى conjugates to أَعْطَيْنَا just as Form I كَتَبَ conjugates to كَتَبْنَا.

5. **Forgetting attached pronouns**: When you see كَتَبْتُهُ, that's not "I wrote" + "he." The final ـهُ (hu) is an object pronoun meaning "it/him." So the full meaning is "I wrote it" or "I wrote him." The subject is "I" (from ـتُ), and the object is "it/him" (from ـهُ).

- Root: _____
- Form: _____
- Tense: _____
- Person/Gender/Number: _____
- Suffix: _____
- Function in sentence: _____

**Answer:**

**كَذَّبَتْ**
- Root: ك-ذ-ب (to lie, to deny, to disbelieve)
- Form: Form II (فَعَّلَ with doubled middle letter — intensive meaning)
- Tense: Past (māḍī)
- Person/Gender/Number: 3rd person feminine singular (she) — but used for the collective noun قَوْمُ (people), which is grammatically feminine
- Suffix: ـَتْ (tā with sukūn marking feminine)
- Function in sentence: Main verb (fiʿl) of a verbal sentence; subject (fāʿil) is قَوْمُ نُوْحٍ (the people of Noah) in nominative case

Note: The verb is feminine because قَوْمُ (people) is treated as a feminine collective noun in Arabic grammar, even though it refers to a group of people of mixed or male gender.
