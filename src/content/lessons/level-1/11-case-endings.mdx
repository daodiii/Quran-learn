## Introduction

In [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-simple-sentences/), you learned to identify sentence parts — subjects, predicates, verbs, and objects. Now here's the beautiful part: Arabic MARKS those parts with special endings so you always know what role each word is playing. These markings are called case endings, and you've actually been seeing them all along!

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One'"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="ٱللَّهُ,أَحَدٌ"
/>

Notice the endings on ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) and أَحَدٌ (aḥadun)? Those aren't random — they tell you exactly what role each word plays in the sentence. In this lesson, you'll learn to recognize these three fundamental case markers.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand that Arabic nouns change endings based on grammatical function
- Visually recognize the three case endings (damma, fatha, kasra patterns)
- Grasp the concept of grammatical case as a functional marker

**Connection:** In [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-simple-sentences/), you learned to identify sentence parts. Now let's see how Arabic MARKS those parts so you can spot them instantly.

## Understanding Case Endings

**Plain English first:** In English, we rely on WORD ORDER to show who does what. "The boy hit the ball" is completely different from "The ball hit the boy" — same words, different order, different meaning.

Arabic is more flexible because it uses ENDINGS instead of strict word order. These endings act like name badges that show each word's job in the sentence.

**Think of case endings as job badges:**
- **Badge 1 (Nominative):** "I'm the DOER" or "I'm the SUBJECT"
- **Badge 2 (Accusative):** "I'm the RECEIVER" or "I'm the OBJECT"
- **Badge 3 (Genitive):** "I'm CONNECTED" (after prepositions or in possession)

### The Three Cases

Arabic has three [grammatical cases](/resources/glossary/#irab) (iʿrāb / إِعْرَاب), and each one is marked by a specific vowel pattern you already learned in [L1.02](/learn/level-1/02-short-vowels/) and [L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-sukun-shadda-tanween/)!

**The key insight:** You already KNOW these marks! You learned them as vowels and nunation. Now you're learning what they MEAN grammatically.

### Case 1: Nominative (The Subject Case)

**English first:** The [nominative case](/resources/glossary/#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْع) is used for the SUBJECT of a sentence — the doer of an action or the thing being described.

**How to spot it:**
- **Marker:** damma (ـُ) or dammatain/double damma (ـٌ)
- **Sound:** -u or -un

**When it's used:**
1. Subject of a nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ) — "Allah (is) One"
2. Subject of a verbal sentence (fāʿil) — "The man said"
3. Predicate of a nominal sentence (khabar) — "Allah is Merciful"

**Example from the Quran:**
- **ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ** (allāhu aḥadun) — "Allah (is) One"
  - ٱللَّهُ (allāhu): nominative subject, marked by damma (ـُ)
  - أَحَدٌ (aḥadun): nominative predicate, marked by dammatain (ـٌ)

### Case 2: Accusative (The Object Case)

**English first:** The [accusative case](/resources/glossary/#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْب) is used for the OBJECT of a sentence — the receiver of an action.

**How to spot it:**
- **Marker:** fatha (ـَ) or fathatain/double fatha (ـً)
- **Sound:** -a or -an

**When it's used:**
1. Direct object (mafʿūl bihi) — "He read THE BOOK"
2. After certain particles (you'll learn these in Level 2)
3. Adverbs of time and place

**Example:**
- **قَرَأَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْكِتَابَ** (qaraʾa ṭ-ṭālibu l-kitāba) — "The student read the book"
  - ٱلطَّالِبُ (aṭ-ṭālibu): nominative subject (doer), marked by damma (ـُ)
  - ٱلْكِتَابَ (al-kitāba): accusative object (receiver), marked by fatha (ـَ)

**Notice the difference:** Same word ٱلْكِتَابُ, different ending depending on its role!

### Case 3: Genitive (The Connected Case)

**English first:** The [genitive case](/resources/glossary/#jarr) (jarr / جَرّ) is used for words that are CONNECTED — after prepositions or in possessive constructions.

**How to spot it:**
- **Marker:** kasra (ـِ) or kasratain/double kasra (ـٍ)
- **Sound:** -i or -in

**When it's used:**
1. After prepositions (فِي "in," مِنْ "from," إِلَىٰ "to," etc.)
2. Second noun in possessive construction (you'll learn this in Level 2)

**Example from the Quran:**
- **بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ** (bismi llāhi) — "In the name of Allah"
  - اِسْمِ (ismi): genitive after preposition بِ (bi-), marked by kasra (ـِ)
  - ٱللَّهِ (allāhi): genitive in possessive construction, marked by kasra (ـِ)

### The Three Cases at a Glance

<GrammarTable>
| Case | Arabic | Marker (Definite) | Marker (Indefinite) | When Used | Example Word |
|------|--------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **Nominative** | رَفْع (rafʿ) | ـُ (damma)<br/>"-u" | ـٌ (dammatain)<br/>"-un" | Subject, Predicate | ٱلْكِتَابُ / كِتَابٌ<br/>al-kitābu / kitābun |
| **Accusative** | نَصْب (naṣb) | ـَ (fatha)<br/>"-a" | ـً (fathatain)<br/>"-an" | Object, After certain particles | ٱلْكِتَابَ / كِتَابًا<br/>al-kitāba / kitāban |
| **Genitive** | جَرّ (jarr) | ـِ (kasra)<br/>"-i" | ـٍ (kasratain)<br/>"-in" | After prepositions, Possession | ٱلْكِتَابِ / كِتَابٍ<br/>al-kitābi / kitābin |
</GrammarTable>

**The pattern:** Same word, three different "outfits" depending on its job!

<Callout type="tip">
**You already knew these marks!**

Remember learning vowels in [L1.02](/learn/level-1/02-short-vowels/)?
- Damma (ـُ) → Nominative
- Fatha (ـَ) → Accusative
- Kasra (ـِ) → Genitive

And tanween in [L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-sukun-shadda-tanween/)?
- Dammatain (ـٌ) → Nominative indefinite
- Fathatain (ـً) → Accusative indefinite
- Kasratain (ـٍ) → Genitive indefinite

Case endings are just these vowels DOING THEIR JOB of showing grammatical function!
</Callout>

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Surah Al-Ikhlas (Chapter 112), which beautifully demonstrates how case endings work in context. This powerful surah about Allah's oneness uses clear sentence structures perfect for spotting case markers.

### Example 1: Nominative Subject and Predicate

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One'"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="ٱللَّهُ,أَحَدٌ"
/>

**Case analysis:**
- **هُوَ** (huwa): "He" — pronoun subject (doesn't show case marking)
- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu): nominative subject, marked by damma (ـُ)
- **أَحَدٌ** (aḥadun): nominative predicate, marked by dammatain (ـٌ)

**This is a nominal sentence:** Subject + Predicate, both in nominative case.

### Example 2: Nominative with Active Participle

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="Allah, the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="ٱللَّهُ,ٱلصَّمَدُ"
/>

**Case analysis:**
- **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu): nominative subject, marked by damma (ـُ)
- **ٱلصَّمَدُ** (aṣ-ṣamadu): nominative predicate, marked by damma (ـُ)

**Notice:** Both definite words end with damma — they're both in nominative case because one is the subject and the other describes it.

### Example 3: Verbal Sentence with Negation

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ"
  transliteration="lam yalid wa lam yūlad"
  translation="He neither begets nor is born"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:3"
/>

**Case analysis:** The verbs يَلِدْ (yalid) and يُولَدْ (yūlad) don't take case endings — only NOUNS do. Verbs have different endings based on tense and mood (you'll learn this in Level 3).

**Key insight:** Case is for NOUNS, not verbs!

### Example 4: Negated Existential with Subject

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌۢ"
  transliteration="wa lam yakun lahū kufuwan aḥadun"
  translation="Nor is there to Him any equivalent"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:4"
  highlight="كُفُوًا,أَحَدٌۢ"
/>

**Case analysis:**
- **كُفُوًا** (kufuwan): accusative predicate of كَانَ, marked by fathatain (ـً)
- **أَحَدٌۢ** (aḥadun): nominative subject, marked by dammatain (ـٌ)

**Advanced note:** The verb كَانَ (kāna) "to be" does something special — it keeps the subject nominative but puts the predicate in accusative. You'll learn why in Level 2!

### Example 5: Genitive After Preposition

From earlier in the lesson, the most common Arabic phrase:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="bismi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi"
  translation="In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  highlight="ٱللَّهِ,ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ,ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
/>

**Case analysis:**
- **بِسْمِ** (bismi): genitive after the preposition بِ (bi-), marked by kasra (ـِ)
- **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi): genitive in possessive construction, marked by kasra (ـِ)
- **ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ** (ar-raḥmāni): genitive adjective, marked by kasra (ـِ)
- **ٱلرَّحِيمِ** (ar-raḥīmi): genitive adjective, marked by kasra (ـِ)

**Notice the pattern:** After the preposition بِ, EVERYTHING is genitive (all kasras)!

<Callout type="tip">
**Spotting patterns in familiar phrases:**

Now that you know about case endings, you can see why the Bismillah phrase has all those kasra endings — it's all genitive because it follows the preposition بِ!

This is why learning case endings helps you UNDERSTAND what you're reading, not just recite it.
</Callout>

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**Three Case Endings in Arabic:**

Every Arabic noun takes one of three case endings based on its grammatical function:

1. **Nominative (rafʿ / رَفْع):**
   - **Markers:** damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)
   - **When:** Subject, Predicate
   - **Think:** "I'm the DOER or the TOPIC"

2. **Accusative (naṣb / نَصْب):**
   - **Markers:** fatha (ـَ) or fathatain (ـً)
   - **When:** Direct object, After certain particles
   - **Think:** "I'm the RECEIVER"

3. **Genitive (jarr / جَرّ):**
   - **Markers:** kasra (ـِ) or kasratain (ـٍ)
   - **When:** After prepositions, In possession
   - **Think:** "I'm CONNECTED"

**The system:** Same word, different ending = different grammatical role.
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
**Level 1 goal: RECOGNITION, not mastery**

You don't need to memorize all the case rules yet — Level 2 is dedicated to teaching you WHEN to use each case. Right now, your goal is simply to:

1. **Recognize** that endings change based on function
2. **Spot** the three case markers visually (damma, fatha, kasra)
3. **Understand** the CONCEPT that Arabic uses endings to show grammatical roles

Awareness now → Mastery in Level 2!
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't try to memorize all case rules now!**

Case endings follow many detailed rules that you'll learn systematically in Level 2:
- L2.04: Nominative Case (when and why)
- L2.05: Accusative Case (all the situations)
- L2.06: Genitive Case (complete coverage)

For now, just get comfortable SEEING the pattern. Understanding comes with practice and dedicated study in Level 2.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 1: Visual Recognition" difficulty="beginner">
Look at these three words. Can you identify which case each one is in based on the ending?

1. ٱلْكِتَابُ (al-kitābu)
2. ٱلْكِتَابَ (al-kitāba)
3. ٱلْكِتَابِ (al-kitābi)

**Hint:** Look at the final vowel mark. Is it damma, fatha, or kasra?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **ٱلْكِتَابُ** (al-kitābu): **Nominative** — ends with damma (ـُ)
   - Could be: the subject, the predicate, the doer

2. **ٱلْكِتَابَ** (al-kitāba): **Accusative** — ends with fatha (ـَ)
   - Could be: the object, the receiver of action

3. **ٱلْكِتَابِ** (al-kitābi): **Genitive** — ends with kasra (ـِ)
   - Could be: after a preposition, in possession

**Key insight:** Same word (ٱلْكِتَابُ "the book"), but three different grammatical "outfits"!

</details>
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 2: Matching Case to Function" difficulty="beginner">
Match each grammatical function with its case:

**Functions:**
1. Subject of a sentence
2. Object of a verb
3. After a preposition

**Cases:**
- A. Accusative (naṣb)
- B. Nominative (rafʿ)
- C. Genitive (jarr)

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **Subject** → **B. Nominative (rafʿ)**
   - The subject/doer always takes nominative case

2. **Object** → **A. Accusative (naṣb)**
   - The direct object/receiver takes accusative case

3. **After preposition** → **C. Genitive (jarr)**
   - Words following prepositions always take genitive case

**Memory aid:** Subject = Superior position = Up (damma ـُ above), Object = Ordinary position = Middle (fatha ـَ middle), Genitive = Grounded position = Below (kasra ـِ below)

</details>
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 3: Identifying Cases in Context" difficulty="intermediate">
Identify the case of the highlighted words in this phrase:

**بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ** (bismi llāhi r-raḥmāni)

1. What case is اِسْمِ (ismi)?
2. What case is ٱللَّهِ (allāhi)?
3. What case is ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (ar-raḥmāni)?
4. Why are they all the same case?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

**All three are GENITIVE (jarr):**

1. **اِسْمِ** (ismi): genitive — marked by kasra (ـِ)
   - Reason: It comes after the preposition بِ (bi-)

2. **ٱللَّهِ** (allāhi): genitive — marked by kasra (ـِ)
   - Reason: Second word in possessive construction ("name OF Allah")

3. **ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ** (ar-raḥmāni): genitive — marked by kasra (ـِ)
   - Reason: Adjective describing ٱللَّهِ, so it matches its case

**Why all the same case?**
The preposition بِ triggers genitive case for the word that follows (اِسْمِ), and then the possessive construction and adjective agreement keep the genitive pattern going.

**This is why the Bismillah has all those "i" sounds at the end!**

</details>
</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox title="Exercise 4: Case Awareness Challenge" difficulty="intermediate">
Look at this nominal sentence from Al-Ikhlas:

**ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ** (allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu) — "Allah is the Eternal Refuge"

1. What case are both words in?
2. Why are they the same case?
3. What would happen if the second word were in accusative (ٱلصَّمَدَ)?

<details>
<summary>Show Answer</summary>

1. **Both are in NOMINATIVE case** (rafʿ), marked by damma (ـُ)

2. **Why the same case?**
   - ٱللَّهُ is the **subject** (mubtadaʾ) → nominative
   - ٱلصَّمَدُ is the **predicate** (khabar) → also nominative
   - In a basic nominal sentence, both subject and predicate are nominative!

3. **If the second word were accusative (ٱلصَّمَدَ):**
   - The sentence structure would change
   - It might signal that a special particle like إِنَّ is affecting it (you'll learn about this in Level 2!)
   - The meaning relationship would be different

**Key insight:** Case endings aren't random — they tell you the precise grammatical relationship between words. Changing the case changes the meaning!
