## Introduction

In English, most words don't have gender — we say "the book," not "the masculine book" or "the feminine book." But in Arabic, EVERY noun has a grammatical gender, either masculine or feminine. This matters because adjectives, verbs, and pronouns must MATCH the gender of the noun they describe!

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ"
  transliteration="idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wal-fatḥu"
  translation="When Allah's help comes and the victory"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:1"
  highlight="نَصْرُ,ٱلْفَتْحُ"
/>

In this verse from Surah An-Nasr, both **نَصْرُ** (naṣru / help) and **ٱلْفَتْحُ** (al-fatḥu / the victory) are masculine nouns. Notice that the verb **جَاءَ** (jāʾa / came) is in the masculine form to agree with them. If they were feminine, the verb would change!

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Identify masculine and feminine nouns by their endings
- Understand the taa marbuta (ة) as the primary feminine marker
- Recognize gender patterns in common Quranic words
- Learn exceptions to the general rules

**Connection:** In [L1.06](/learn/level-1/three-word-types), you learned that **ism** (nouns) are one of the three fundamental word types in Arabic. Now discover that every single ism has a GENDER that affects how it behaves in sentences.

## Understanding Gender in Arabic

**Plain English first:** Grammatical gender is like a category label attached to every noun. It's not about biological gender (though those match) — it's about how the word behaves grammatically.

**English analogy:** Think about "actor/actress" or "prince/princess" — the -ess ending signals feminine. Arabic has similar patterns, but EVERY noun has gender, even non-living things like "book" or "house."

### The Two Genders

Every Arabic noun is either:

1. **[Masculine](/resources/glossary#mudhakkar) (mudhakkar / مُذَكَّرٌ)** — the default gender, usually has no special marker
2. **[Feminine](/resources/glossary#muannath) (muʾannath / مُؤَنَّثٌ)** — usually marked by a special ending

**Key insight:** Unlike English where gender is only for people, Arabic assigns gender to EVERYTHING — objects, concepts, times, places.

## The Taa Marbuta: The Feminine Marker

The most important feminine marker in Arabic is the [taa marbuta](/resources/glossary#taa-marbuta) (tāʾ marbūṭah / تَاءٌ مَرْبُوطَةٌ). This is the special letter **ة** that appears at the end of feminine nouns.

**What it looks like:**
- **ـة** when connected to a previous letter
- **ة** when standing alone (rare)

**How it sounds:**
- In isolation or at the end of a sentence: silent or pronounced as **ـه** (-h)
- In connected speech: pronounced as **ـت** (-t) when followed by another word

**The taa marbuta test:** If a noun ends with ة, it is ALMOST ALWAYS feminine.

**Examples:**
- **رَحْمَةٌ** (raḥmah / mercy) — FEMININE
- **جَنَّةٌ** (jannah / paradise) — FEMININE
- **صَلَاةٌ** (ṣalāh / prayer) — FEMININE

### Identifying Gender: Quick Reference

<GrammarTable>
| Gender | Marker | Examples | Translation | Notes |
|--------|--------|----------|-------------|-------|
| Feminine | Ends with **ة** (taa marbuta) | رَحْمَةٌ (raḥmah) | mercy | ~90% reliable |
| Feminine | Ends with **اء** (alif + hamza) | سَمَاءٌ (samāʾ) | sky | Common pattern |
| Feminine | Ends with long **ى** or **ا** | دُنْيَا (dunyā) | world | Some words |
| Masculine | No special marker | كِتَابٌ (kitāb) | book | Default |
| Masculine | No special marker | رَجُلٌ (rajul) | man | Default |
</GrammarTable>

<Callout type="warning">
**Important exceptions:** Some words are feminine WITHOUT taa marbuta:

- **أُمٌّ** (umm / mother) — feminine, no ة
- **أَرْضٌ** (arḍ / earth, land) — feminine, no ة
- **شَمْسٌ** (shams / sun) — feminine, no ة
- **نَارٌ** (nār / fire) — feminine, no ة

And a few words have ة but are masculine (very rare, like **خَلِيْفَةٌ** / khalīfah / successor, which can be masculine when referring to a male).

You'll learn to recognize these through exposure to Quranic vocabulary.

## Examples from Surah An-Nasr

Let's examine gender in context from Surah An-Nasr (Chapter 110):

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا جَآءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ"
  transliteration="idhā jāʾa naṣru llāhi wal-fatḥu"
  translation="When Allah's help comes and the victory"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:1"
/>

**Gender analysis:**
- **نَصْرُ** (naṣru / help) — MASCULINE (no taa marbuta, no feminine marker)
- **ٱلْفَتْحُ** (al-fatḥu / the victory) — MASCULINE (no taa marbuta)
- **Notice:** The verb **جَاءَ** (jāʾa / he came) is masculine singular to agree with the masculine nouns

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَرَأَيْتَ ٱلنَّاسَ يَدْخُلُونَ فِى دِينِ ٱللَّهِ أَفْوَاجًۭا"
  transliteration="wa-raʾayta n-nāsa yadkhulūna fī dīni llāhi afwājan"
  translation="And you see people entering Allah's religion in crowds"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:2"
/>

**Gender analysis:**
- **ٱلنَّاسَ** (an-nās / the people) — MASCULINE (collective noun, no taa marbuta)
- **دِينٍ** (dīn / religion) — MASCULINE (no feminine marker)
- **أَفْوَاجًا** (afwāj / crowds, groups) — MASCULINE (plural, no taa marbuta)

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَسَبِّحْ بِحَمْدِ رَبِّكَ وَٱسْتَغْفِرْهُ ۚ إِنَّهُۥ كَانَ تَوَّابًۢا"
  transliteration="fa-sabbiḥ bi-ḥamdi rabbika wastagh'firhu innahu kāna tawwāban"
  translation="Then glorify the praises of your Lord and seek His forgiveness, indeed He is ever-Accepting of repentance"
  reference="An-Nasr 110:3"
/>

**Gender analysis:**
- **حَمْدِ** (ḥamd / praise) — MASCULINE (no taa marbuta)
- **رَبِّكَ** (rabbika / your Lord) — MASCULINE (no feminine marker)
- **تَوَّابًۢا** (tawwāb / Accepting of repentance) — MASCULINE form (describing Allah)

### More Examples: Feminine Nouns

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ"
  transliteration="al-ḥamdu lillāhi rabbi l-ʿālamīna"
  translation="All praise belongs to Allah, Lord of all the worlds"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:2"
/>

**Hidden feminine:** The word **حَمْدُ** (ḥamdu / praise) is actually MASCULINE, but related words like **رَحْمَةٌ** (raḥmah / mercy) are FEMININE.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthar"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you abundant good"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
/>

**Gender note:** **ٱلْكَوْثَرَ** (al-kawthar / abundant good, a river in Paradise) is MASCULINE (no taa marbuta).

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَٱلشَّمْسِ وَضُحَىٰهَا"
  transliteration="wash-shamsi wa-ḍuḥāhā"
  translation="By the sun and its brightness"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:1"
/>

**Exception alert:** **ٱلشَّمْسِ** (ash-shams / the sun) is FEMININE even though it has no taa marbuta. This is one of those words you must memorize.

## The Rule: How to Identify Gender

<Callout type="rule">
**The Taa Marbuta Rule:**

If a noun ends with **ة** (taa marbuta), it is **FEMININE** (with rare exceptions).

If a noun does NOT end with taa marbuta, it is **probably MASCULINE** — but watch for common feminine exceptions like:
- **أُمٌّ** (umm / mother)
- **أَرْضٌ** (arḍ / earth)
- **شَمْسٌ** (shams / sun)
- **نَارٌ** (nār / fire)
- Words ending in **اء** (alif + hamza)
- Words ending in long **ى** or **ا** (alif)

**When in doubt:** Check a dictionary or learn from context (how adjectives and verbs agree with the noun).
</Callout>

<Callout type="warning">
**Don't apply English logic!**

Just because something is masculine in English doesn't mean it's masculine in Arabic:
- "Sun" is feminine in Arabic: **شَمْسٌ** (shams)
- "Moon" is masculine in Arabic: **قَمَرٌ** (qamar)

Trust the Arabic pattern, not the English meaning!

## Why Gender Matters

Understanding gender is CRITICAL because:

1. **Adjectives must match:** A feminine noun needs a feminine adjective
   - **كِتَابٌ كَبِيْرٌ** (kitābun kabīr / a big book) — both masculine
   - **مَدِيْنَةٌ كَبِيْرَةٌ** (madīnatun kabīrah / a big city) — both feminine (notice the ة on both!)

2. **Verbs must agree:** Past tense verbs change based on the gender of the subject
   - **جَاءَ ٱلرَّجُلُ** (jāʾa r-rajulu / the man came) — masculine verb
   - **جَاءَتِ ٱلْمَرْأَةُ** (jāʾati l-marʾatu / the woman came) — feminine verb (added ت)

3. **Pronouns must match:** "He" vs. "she" depends on the noun's gender
   - **هُوَ** (huwa / he) — for masculine nouns
   - **هِيَ** (hiya / she) — for feminine nouns

You'll learn these agreement rules in Level 2, but for now, focus on IDENTIFYING the gender of individual nouns.

**Previous:** [The Definite Article (Al-)](/learn/level-1/definite-article) — You learned how to make nouns definite with ال. Now you know every noun also has GENDER.

**Next:** [Singular, Dual & Plural](/learn/level-1/singular-dual-plural) — After learning gender, the next noun property is NUMBER. Arabic has a surprise: THREE number forms (singular, dual, plural)!

**Remember:** Gender is FIXED for each noun. You don't decide — you LEARN which words are masculine and which are feminine. The taa marbuta (ة) is your best friend for recognition!
