## Introduction

You've learned to read Arabic, distinguish word types, and understand noun properties. Now it's time to see how words come TOGETHER to form sentences. Every Arabic sentence follows one of two fundamental patterns, and understanding them is your gateway to reading the Quran with comprehension.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ"
  transliteration="qul yā ayyuhā l-kāfirūna"
  translation="Say, 'O disbelievers'"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "say" },
    { ar: "يَٰٓأَيُّهَا", tr: "yā ayyuhā", en: "O" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ", tr: "l-kāfirūna", en: "the disbelievers" }
  ]}
/>

This opening verse of Surah Al-Kafirun shows a simple verbal sentence — it starts with an action word. In this lesson, you'll learn to identify the two sentence patterns that make up ALL Arabic speech.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Understand that Arabic has two basic sentence types: nominal and verbal
- Identify the subject and action/description in simple sentences
- Recognize basic sentence word order patterns

**Connection:** You've learned word types ([L1.06](/learn/level-1/06-three-word-types/)), the definite article ([L1.07](/learn/level-1/07-definite-article/)), gender ([L1.08](/learn/level-1/08-gender-masculine-feminine/)), and number ([L1.09](/learn/level-1/09-singular-dual-plural/)). Now let's see how words come together to form SENTENCES.

## Understanding Simple Sentences

**Plain English first:** In English, we usually follow a fixed pattern: subject + verb ("The boy runs," "Birds fly"). Arabic is more flexible. It has TWO basic sentence patterns, and the FIRST WORD tells you which pattern you're looking at.

**Think of it like two different sentence blueprints:**
- **Blueprint A (Nominal):** Starts with a NOUN — describes what something IS
- **Blueprint B (Verbal):** Starts with a VERB — describes what something DOES

Every Arabic sentence uses one of these two blueprints. No exceptions.

### The Nominal Sentence (Starts with a Noun)

**English first:** A [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة) is a sentence that begins with a NOUN and tells you what something IS or describes a state of being.

**The key insight:** Arabic doesn't need the word "is" or "are" — it's IMPLIED. When you see two nouns side by side, Arabic assumes you mean "X is Y."

**Two parts of a nominal sentence:**
1. **[Subject](/resources/glossary/#mubtada)** (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — the thing being talked about
2. **[Predicate](/resources/glossary/#khabar)** (khabar / خَبَر) — what you're saying about it

**English examples to help you understand:**
- "The sky is blue" → Nominal (describes state)
- "Allah is Merciful" → Nominal (describes attribute)
- "The book is on the table" → Nominal (describes location)

**Arabic example:**
- **ٱللَّهُ رَحِيمٌ** (allāhu raḥīmun) — "Allah (is) Merciful"
  - Subject (mubtadaʾ): ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) — Allah
  - Predicate (khabar): رَحِيمٌ (raḥīmun) — Merciful

Notice: No word for "is" — it's understood from the structure!

### The Verbal Sentence (Starts with a Verb)

**English first:** A [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary/#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة) is a sentence that begins with a VERB and tells you what ACTION is happening.

**Three elements of a verbal sentence:**
1. **Verb** (fiʿl / فِعْلٌ) — the action
2. **[Subject](/resources/glossary/#fail)** (fāʿil / فَاعِلٌ) — the doer of the action
3. **Object** (mafʿūl bihi / مَفْعُول بِهِ) — optional, the receiver of the action

**Word order:** Verb → Subject → Object (if there is one)

**English examples:**
- "He runs fast" → Verbal (describes action)
- "Birds fly south" → Verbal (describes action)
- "She reads the Quran" → Verbal (describes action)

**Arabic example:**
- **قَالَ ٱلرَّجُلُ** (qāla r-rajulu) — "The man said"
  - Verb: قَالَ (qāla) — said
  - Subject: ٱلرَّجُلُ (ar-rajulu) — the man

**Key difference from English:** Arabic typically puts the VERB FIRST, then the subject. English does the opposite!

### Comparison Table

<GrammarTable>
| Feature | Nominal Sentence (جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة) | Verbal Sentence (جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة) |
|---------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **First word** | Noun | Verb |
| **Purpose** | Describes what something IS | Describes what something DOES |
| **Structure** | Subject + Predicate | Verb + Subject + (Object) |
| **"Is/Are"** | IMPLIED (not written) | Not applicable |
| **Example** | ٱللَّهُ رَحِيمٌ (allāhu raḥīmun)<br/>"Allah (is) Merciful" | قَالَ ٱلرَّجُلُ (qāla r-rajulu)<br/>"The man said" |
| **When to use** | Static descriptions, states | Actions, events |
</GrammarTable>

**The one-second test:** Look at the FIRST WORD. Is it a noun? Nominal sentence. Is it a verb? Verbal sentence. Done!

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine Surah Al-Kafirun (Chapter 109), which beautifully demonstrates both sentence types. This short surah uses clear, repetitive structures perfect for learning sentence patterns.

### Verbal Sentence Examples

**Example 1: Command verb**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ"
  transliteration="qul yā ayyuhā l-kāfirūna"
  translation="Say, 'O disbelievers'"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:1"
  highlight="قُلْ"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "say" },
    { ar: "يَٰٓأَيُّهَا", tr: "yā ayyuhā", en: "O" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ", tr: "l-kāfirūna", en: "the disbelievers" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Sentence type:** Verbal (starts with verb)
- **Verb:** قُلْ (qul) — "Say!" (command form)
- **Subject:** You (implied in the verb ending)
- **Object:** The rest of the verse (what to say)

**Example 2: Negated verb**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَآ أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ"
  transliteration="lā aʿbudu mā taʿbudūna"
  translation="I do not worship what you worship"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:2"
  highlight="أَعْبُدُ"
  words={[
    { ar: "لَآ", tr: "lā", en: "not" },
    { ar: "أَعْبُدُ", tr: "aʿbudu", en: "I worship" },
    { ar: "مَا", tr: "mā", en: "what" },
    { ar: "تَعْبُدُونَ", tr: "taʿbudūna", en: "you worship" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Sentence type:** Verbal (starts with negation particle + verb)
- **Verb:** أَعْبُدُ (aʿbudu) — "I worship" (present tense, first person)
- **Subject:** I (implied in the verb ending)
- **Object:** مَا تَعْبُدُونَ (mā taʿbudūna) — "what you worship"

### Nominal Sentence Examples

**Example 3: Negated nominal sentence**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَآ أَنتُمْ عَٰبِدُونَ مَآ أَعْبُدُ"
  transliteration="wa lā antum ʿābidūna mā aʿbudu"
  translation="Nor are you worshippers of what I worship"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:3"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَلَآ", tr: "wa lā", en: "and not" },
    { ar: "أَنتُمْ", tr: "antum", en: "you (pl.)" },
    { ar: "عَٰبِدُونَ", tr: "ʿābidūna", en: "worshippers of" },
    { ar: "مَآ", tr: "mā", en: "what" },
    { ar: "أَعْبُدُ", tr: "aʿbudu", en: "I worship" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Sentence type:** Nominal (starts with the pronoun أَنتُمْ — "you")
- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** أَنتُمْ (antum) — you (plural)
- **Predicate (khabar):** عَٰبِدُونَ (ʿābidūna) — worshippers (active participle acting as predicate)

**Note:** This verse was previously listed under "Verbal Sentence Examples," but it is actually a nominal sentence — it begins with a pronoun (أَنتُمْ), not a verb. The conjunction وَلَآ ("and not") precedes the subject but does not change the sentence type.

### Understanding Negation

<Callout type="tip">
**Spotting sentence types with negation particles:**

The particle لَا (lā) means "not" and can appear with both sentence types:
- **لَا + verb** → Verbal sentence (negates an action)
- **لَا + noun/pronoun** → Can be nominal (negates a state)

The key is to look at what comes AFTER لَا. If it's a verb, the sentence is verbal. If it's a noun, it may be nominal.
</Callout>

### More Examples from Al-Kafirun

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَآ أَنَا۠ عَابِدٌۭ مَّا عَبَدتُّمْ"
  transliteration="wa lā ana ʿābidun mā ʿabadtum"
  translation="And I am not a worshipper of what you worshipped"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:4"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَلَآ", tr: "wa lā", en: "and not" },
    { ar: "أَنَا۠", tr: "ana", en: "I" },
    { ar: "عَابِدٌۭ", tr: "ʿābidun", en: "a worshipper of" },
    { ar: "مَّا", tr: "mā", en: "what" },
    { ar: "عَبَدتُّمْ", tr: "ʿabadtum", en: "you worshipped" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:**
- **Sentence type:** Nominal (starts with pronoun أَنَا۠ — "I")
- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** أَنَا۠ (ana) — I
- **Predicate (khabar):** عَابِدٌۭ (ʿābidun) — a worshipper

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ وَلِىَ دِينِ"
  transliteration="lakum dīnukum wa liya dīni"
  translation="For you is your religion, and for me is my religion"
  reference="Al-Kafirun 109:6"
  words={[
    { ar: "لَكُمْ", tr: "lakum", en: "for you" },
    { ar: "دِينُكُمْ", tr: "dīnukum", en: "your religion" },
    { ar: "وَلِىَ", tr: "wa liya", en: "and for me" },
    { ar: "دِينِ", tr: "dīni", en: "my religion" }
  ]}
/>

**Analysis:** This verse contains TWO nominal sentences:
1. **لَكُمْ دِينُكُمْ** (lakum dīnukum) — "For you (is) your religion"
   - Predicate (advanced): لَكُمْ (lakum) — for you
   - Subject: دِينُكُمْ (dīnukum) — your religion

2. **وَلِىَ دِينِ** (wa liya dīni) — "And for me (is) my religion"
   - Predicate (advanced): لِىَ (liya) — for me
   - Subject: دِينِ (dīni) — my religion

<Callout type="warning">
**Advanced structure:** When a nominal sentence starts with a prepositional phrase (like لَكُمْ "for you"), the word order can flip: predicate comes BEFORE subject. Don't worry about mastering this yet — just notice that both sentences describe STATES (what belongs to whom), not ACTIONS.
</Callout>

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule">
**Two Sentence Types in Arabic:**

1. **Nominal Sentence (جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة):**
   - Starts with a NOUN
   - Structure: Subject (mubtadaʾ) + Predicate (khabar)
   - No "is/are" needed — it's IMPLIED
   - Describes STATES, descriptions, identities

2. **Verbal Sentence (جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة):**
   - Starts with a VERB
   - Structure: Verb + Subject (fāʿil) + optional Object
   - Word order: typically VERB-first (unlike English)
   - Describes ACTIONS, events

**How to identify:** Look at the FIRST WORD (ignoring وَ "and"):
- Noun → Nominal
- Verb → Verbal
</Callout>

<Callout type="tip">
**Why two types matter:**

Understanding sentence types helps you:
1. **Parse meaning faster** — you instantly know if you're reading about an action or a description
2. **Predict word roles** — you know what to expect next in the sentence
3. **Handle word order** — Arabic is more flexible than English because sentence type signals structure
</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 1: Identify the Sentence Type">
Look at these verses from Al-Kafirun. Is each one a NOMINAL or VERBAL sentence?

1. قُلْ يَٰٓأَيُّهَا ٱلْكَٰفِرُونَ (qul yā ayyuhā l-kāfirūna)
2. وَلَآ أَنتُمْ عَٰبِدُونَ مَآ أَعْبُدُ (wa lā antum ʿābidūna mā aʿbudu)
3. لَآ أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ (lā aʿbudu mā taʿbudūna)

**Hint:** Look at the first significant word (after وَ if present). Is it a noun/pronoun or a verb?

1. **VERBAL** — Starts with قُلْ (qul), a command verb meaning "say"
2. **NOMINAL** — Starts with أَنتُمْ (antum) "you," a pronoun (nouns include pronouns!)
3. **VERBAL** — Starts with أَعْبُدُ (aʿbudu), a present-tense verb meaning "I worship"

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 2: Identify Subject and Predicate">
In this nominal sentence, identify the subject (mubtadaʾ) and predicate (khabar):

**ٱللَّهُ غَفُورٌۭ رَّحِيمٌۭ** (allāhu ghafūrun raḥīmun) — "Allah is Forgiving, Merciful"

Which word is the subject? Which words are the predicate?

- **Subject (mubtadaʾ):** ٱللَّهُ (allāhu) — Allah (the one being described)
- **Predicate (khabar):** غَفُورٌۭ رَّحِيمٌۭ (ghafūrun raḥīmun) — Forgiving, Merciful (the description)

**Key insight:** The predicate can be two words! Both describe Allah.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 3: Identify Verb and Subject">
In this verbal sentence, identify the verb and the subject (fāʿil):

**قَالَ ٱلرَّسُولُ** (qāla r-rasūlu) — "The messenger said"

Which word is the verb? Which word is the subject?

- **Verb:** قَالَ (qāla) — said (past tense, third person masculine singular)
- **Subject (fāʿil):** ٱلرَّسُولُ (ar-rasūlu) — the messenger (the doer of "saying")

**Key insight:** In Arabic verbal sentences, the verb typically comes FIRST, then the subject. English does the opposite ("The messenger said" not "Said the messenger").

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Exercise 4: Construct Your Own">
Create two simple sentences using these words:

**Words provided:**
- ٱلْكِتَابُ (al-kitābu) — the book
- جَدِيدٌ (jadīdun) — new
- قَرَأَ (qaraʾa) — he read
- ٱلطَّالِبُ (aṭ-ṭālibu) — the student

**Tasks:**
1. Make a NOMINAL sentence (describes what the book IS)
2. Make a VERBAL sentence (describes what the student DID)


**Nominal sentence:**
ٱلْكِتَابُ جَدِيدٌ (al-kitābu jadīdun) — "The book (is) new"
- Subject: ٱلْكِتَابُ (the book)
- Predicate: جَدِيدٌ (new)

**Verbal sentence:**
قَرَأَ ٱلطَّالِبُ ٱلْكِتَابَ (qaraʾa ṭ-ṭālibu l-kitāba) — "The student read the book"
- Verb: قَرَأَ (read)
- Subject: ٱلطَّالِبُ (the student)
- Object: ٱلْكِتَابَ (the book) — notice the different ending!

**Note:** The object ٱلْكِتَابَ has a fatha (ـَ) ending instead of damma (ـُ). This is called "case," and you'll learn about it in the next lesson!
