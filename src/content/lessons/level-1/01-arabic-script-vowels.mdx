## Introduction

Every word in the Quran is made of two things: **letters** that give each sound its shape, and tiny **marks** that tell you how to pronounce them. Both appear together in the very first verse you will ever read:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="bismi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi"
  translation="In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "بِسْمِ", tr: "bismi", en: "In the name of" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ", tr: "r-raḥmāni", en: "the Most Gracious" },
    { ar: "ٱلرَّحِيمِ", tr: "r-raḥīmi", en: "the Most Merciful" },
  ]}
/>

Notice how the letters connect to each other like cursive handwriting, and how small marks sit above and below them. The letters are the 28 consonants of the Arabic alphabet; the marks are vowels that control pronunciation. In this lesson you will learn both.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize all 28 Arabic letters in their isolated, initial, medial, and final forms
- Understand which six letters break the connecting chain
- Distinguish between similar-looking letter groups (ba/ta/tha, jim/ha/kha, and others)
- Identify and pronounce the three short vowels: fatha, kasra, and damma
- Read simple voweled words from the Quran

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Matters in Your Quran Reading">
Every word in the Quran is built from these 28 letters and 3 short vowels. Learning them means you can READ any word in the Quran — even if you don't yet know what it means. This is the foundation everything else builds on.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note" title="Quick Win">
After this lesson, open the Quran to Al-Fatiha and try reading the first word: بِسْمِ. You can now identify each letter (ba, sin, mim) and each vowel (kasra, no vowel, kasra). You're reading Arabic!

## Part 1 — The Arabic Alphabet

Arabic has 28 letters, similar to English's 26. But unlike printed English, where every letter always looks the same, Arabic letters **change shape** depending on where they appear in a word. Think of English cursive: the letter "s" at the start of a word looks different from "s" in the middle. Arabic works the same way, but in ALL writing, not just cursive.

In Arabic, this writing system is called the alphabet (ḥurūf al-hijāʾ / حُرُوفُ ٱلْهِجَاءِ). Each of the 28 letters can appear in up to four forms:

1. **Isolated** — standing alone
2. **Initial** — starting a word (connects to the left)
3. **Medial** — in the middle (connects on both sides)
4. **Final** — ending a word (connects to the right)

Most letters connect on both sides — they reach backward to the previous letter and forward to the next one. However, six special letters — alif (ا), dal (د), dhal (ذ), ra (ر), zayn (ز), and waw (و) — only connect to the letter **before** them. They never reach forward to the next letter, so they create a natural break in the word. These are called **non-connecting letters**, and they have only two distinct forms (isolated and final) instead of four.

A helpful memory trick: five of the six non-connecting letters have no dots and sit on or below the line. Learn to spot them quickly — they are the letters that "refuse to hold hands" with the letter after them.

### All 28 Letters

**Note:** Non-connecting letters (alif, dal, dhal, ra, zayn, waw) have the same shape for isolated and initial, and the same shape for medial and final. This means you only need to memorize TWO forms for these six letters, not four. That is 6 fewer shapes to learn right away.

### Letter Forms in Context

Now let's trace how letters change shape inside real Quranic words. Watch how the same letter looks completely different depending on its position.

**The letter ba (ب) in initial position:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ"
  transliteration="bismi"
  translation="In the name of"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "بِسْمِ", tr: "bismi", en: "In the name of" },
  ]}
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **بِ** (bi) — **Initial form** of ba: it starts the word and connects to the next letter
- **سْ** (s) — **Medial form** of sin: it sits between ba and mim, connecting on both sides
- **مِ** (mi) — **Final form** of mim: it ends the word and connects only to the letter before it

Compare these connected forms with the isolated letters ب، س، م in the table above — you can see how each letter adapts its shape to flow into its neighbors.

**Non-connecting letters create breaks:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ"
  transliteration="rabbi l-ʿālamīna"
  translation="Lord of the worlds"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:2"
  words={[
    { ar: "رَبِّ", tr: "rabbi", en: "Lord" },
    { ar: "ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ", tr: "l-ʿālamīna", en: "the worlds" },
  ]}
/>

In ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ, the alif (ا) cannot connect forward, so it creates a natural break in the word. The letters after it start a new connected group. This is exactly how the six non-connecting letters behave every time they appear.

**Two lams connecting together in the name of Allah:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="llāhi"
  translation="Allah"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱللَّهِ", tr: "llāhi", en: "Allah" },
  ]}
/>

In ٱللَّهِ, the alif wasla (ٱ) is silent and starts the word. The two lams (لل) connect to each other in their medial forms — notice how different they look from the isolated letter ل standing alone. The ha (ه) at the end uses its final form (ـه). This word is a perfect example of how connecting letters flow together smoothly.

**Detailed breakdown:**
- **ٱ** — Alif wasla (special silent alif at the start)
- **لْ** — First lam with sukun (no vowel)
- **لَّ** — Second lam with fatha and shadda (doubled sound)
- **هِ** — Ha in final form with kasra

### Similar Letter Groups

Many Arabic letters share the same basic shape and differ only in dots. Pay special attention to these groups:

- **ب / ت / ث** (ba / ta / tha) — one dot below, two dots above, three dots above
- **ج / ح / خ** (jim / ha / kha) — one dot below, no dots, one dot above
- **د / ذ** (dal / dhal) — no dot vs. one dot above
- **ر / ز** (ra / zayn) — no dot vs. one dot above
- **س / ش** (sin / shin) — no dots vs. three dots above
- **ص / ض** (sad / dad) — no dot vs. one dot above
- **ط / ظ** (ta emphatic / za emphatic) — no dot vs. one dot above
- **ع / غ** (ayn / ghayn) — no dot vs. one dot above

The dots are not decoration — they completely change the letter's sound and meaning. When you first start reading, slow down and deliberately count dots on every letter. Speed will come with practice.

## Part 2 — Short Vowels (Harakat)

Now that you can recognize the 28 consonant letters, the next question is: how do you actually *pronounce* them? The letters alone are like the English consonants "B-K" — they could be "book," "bike," or "bake." You need vowels to know which word it is.

Arabic solves this elegantly. Instead of writing separate vowel letters between consonants (the way English does), Arabic places small marks **above or below** each consonant letter. Think of these marks as pronunciation instructions written directly on the letter itself. In English you write "cat" with the vowel "a" between "c" and "t." In Arabic, you write the consonant and place a tiny mark on it to show which vowel sound follows.

These marks are called [short vowels](/resources/glossary/#harakat) (ḥarakāt / حَرَكَاتٌ), and there are exactly three:

1. **Fatha** (فَتْحَةٌ) **[َ]** — a small diagonal dash **above** the letter, making an "a" sound (like the "a" in "cat" or "father")
2. **Kasra** (كَسْرَةٌ) **[ِ]** — a small diagonal dash **below** the letter, making an "i" sound (like the "i" in "sit" or "in")
3. **Damma** (ضَمَّةٌ) **[ُ]** — a small curled mark **above** the letter, making a "u" sound (like the "u" in "put" or "book")

Notice the pattern: fatha and damma sit **above** the letter, while kasra sits **below**. This distinction will help you identify vowels quickly when reading.

<GrammarTable
  caption="The Three Short Vowels"
  headers={["Name", "Mark", "Sound", "English Equivalent", "Example"]}
  rows={[
    ["Fatha", "َ", "a", "Like 'a' in 'cat'", "بَ (ba)"],
    ["Kasra", "ِ", "i", "Like 'i' in 'sit'", "بِ (bi)"],
    ["Damma", "ُ", "u", "Like 'u' in 'put'", "بُ (bu)"]
  ]}
/>

### Vowels in Context

Let's see how these three vowels work in real Quranic words. We will use examples from Surah Al-Ikhlas and Surah Al-Fatiha, which contain simple, clear vowel patterns perfect for beginners.

**Damma — the "u" sound:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, the One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "Say" },
    { ar: "هُوَ", tr: "huwa", en: "He" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهُ", tr: "llāhu", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "أَحَدٌ", tr: "aḥadun", en: "One" },
  ]}
/>

Look at the letter qaf (ق) in قُلْ. The small curled mark above it is damma, turning it into "qu." If that mark were fatha instead, it would be "qa." If it were kasra, it would be "qi." The vowel mark completely controls the sound.

In هُوَ, the ha (ه) also carries damma, giving "hu," while the waw (و) carries fatha, giving "wa" — together, "huwa" (he). And in ٱللَّهُ, notice the final damma on the ha, giving "hu" — this is the nominative case ending, which you will learn about in later grammar lessons.

**Fatha — the "a" sound:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="aḥadun"
  translation="One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "أَحَدٌ", tr: "aḥadun", en: "One" },
  ]}
/>

Both the hamza (أَ) and the ha (حَ) carry fatha, creating the repeating "a" sound: a-ḥa. The final dal (دٌ) carries tanween damma (a doubled vowel mark you will learn in the next lesson), which produces the "un" ending — giving us "dun." Notice how fatha appears twice in this word, showing that the same vowel mark can repeat throughout a word.

**Kasra — the "i" sound:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="ar-raḥīmi"
  translation="the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱلرَّحِيمِ", tr: "ar-raḥīmi", en: "the Most Merciful" },
  ]}
/>

The ha (حِ) carries kasra — the mark sits **below** the letter — producing "ḥi." The final mim (مِ) also carries kasra, giving "mi." The kasra is the only short vowel placed beneath the consonant, making it easy to identify at a glance: if you see a small mark under a letter, it is always kasra, always the "i" sound.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Letters and Vowels — The Two Building Blocks">

**Letters** — Arabic has 28 consonant letters. Each can appear in up to four forms (isolated, initial, medial, final) depending on its position in a word. Six non-connecting letters (ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و) only connect backward and have two forms.

**Vowels** — Three short vowel marks sit on the consonants to control pronunciation:
1. **Fatha (َ)** = "a" — placed above the letter
2. **Kasra (ِ)** = "i" — placed below the letter
3. **Damma (ُ)** = "u" — placed above the letter

In Quranic text, every consonant carries a vowel mark (or a sukun for silence). These marks are essential for correct pronunciation — they are never optional. The same consonant with different vowels can be a completely different word with a completely different meaning.

</Callout>

## Common Mistakes

<Callout type="warning" title="Watch Out For These">

**Confusing similar letter groups.** Letters like ب/ت/ث or ج/ح/خ share the same basic shape and differ only by dots. Always count the dots and check their position (above or below) carefully. Reading too fast and skipping dot-checking is the number one reason beginners misread words.

**Ignoring vowel marks.** The same three consonants can form completely different words depending on the vowels:
- كَتَبَ (kataba) = "he wrote"
- كُتِبَ (kutiba) = "it was written"
- كُتُبٌ (kutubun) = "books"

**Mixing up kasra and ya.** Kasra (ِ) is a small diagonal mark under the letter. Ya (ي) is a full letter with two dots beneath it. They produce a similar "i" sound but are completely different: kasra is a short vowel mark on a consonant, while ya is a letter in its own right. You will learn more about this distinction when you study long vowels.

</Callout>

## Practice

Test your understanding of both letter forms and vowel marks. These exercises combine both skills — first identifying the letter and its form, then reading the vowel mark to determine pronunciation.

<ExerciseBox question="Which form of the letter mim (م) appears in the word بِسْمِ (bismi), and how do you know?">

**Answer:** Final form (ـم)

The letter mim is the last letter in بِسْمِ. Because it ends the word and connects to the sin before it, it uses its **final form**. Compare isolated mim (م) with the connected final form (ـم) in the table above — the connecting stroke on the right side is the giveaway.

If mim appeared in the middle of a word, it would use its medial form (ـمـ) with connecting strokes on both sides. Knowing which form to expect helps you read faster.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="How many dots does tha (ث) have, and how does it differ from ba (ب) and ta (ت)?">

**Answer:** Three dots above

All three letters share the same body shape. They differ only by dots:
- Ba (ب) — one dot **below**
- Ta (ت) — two dots **above**
- Tha (ث) — three dots **above**

Tha sounds like "th" in "think." Do not confuse it with dhal (ذ), which sounds like "th" in "this." These are different letters with different sounds, even though English uses "th" for both.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="What vowel mark appears on the letter qaf (ق) in قُلْ (qul), and what sound does it make?">

**Answer:** Damma (ُ) — makes the "u" sound

The small curled mark above the qaf is damma (ضَمَّة). It creates the "u" sound, like the "u" in "put" or "book." So ق + damma = قُ (qu). Combined with the lam that follows (which has sukun — no vowel), you get "qul" meaning "say."

If the qaf had fatha instead (قَ), it would be "qa." If it had kasra (قِ), it would be "qi." The vowel mark completely changes the pronunciation of the same consonant.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Read the word هُوَ (huwa) aloud. Why is it 'hu-wa' and not 'ha-wa'?">

**Answer:** Because the ha (ه) carries a damma (ُ), not a fatha (َ)

The letter ha (ه) by itself has no built-in vowel sound. The vowel mark tells you exactly how to pronounce it:
- With damma: هُ = "hu" (like "who")
- With fatha: هَ = "ha"
- With kasra: هِ = "hi"

In هُوَ, the damma on ha gives "hu," and the fatha on waw gives "wa." Together: hu + wa = "huwa" (he). This pronoun appears constantly in the Quran to refer to Allah. Change the damma to fatha and you would get "hawa" — a completely different word meaning "desire."

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Analyze the word بِسْمِ (bismi): identify each letter's form AND its vowel mark.">

**Answer:**

| Letter | Form | Vowel | Sound |
|--------|------|-------|-------|
| بِ (ba) | Initial (بـ) | Kasra (ِ) | "bi" |
| سْ (sin) | Medial (ـسـ) | Sukun (no vowel) | "s" |
| مِ (mim) | Final (ـم) | Kasra (ِ) | "mi" |

**Reading it step by step:**
1. Ba is the first letter, so it uses its **initial form** (بـ). The kasra below it tells you to say "bi."
2. Sin is in the middle, so it uses its **medial form** (ـسـ). The sukun on top means no vowel follows — just the bare "s" sound.
3. Mim is the last letter, so it uses its **final form** (ـم). The kasra below it tells you to say "mi."

Together: bi + s + mi = "bismi" (in the name of).

This single word demonstrates three different letter forms and two different vowel situations — exactly the two skills this lesson teaches. When you can break down any word like this, you are ready to read the Quran letter by letter.
