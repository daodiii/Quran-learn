## Introduction

Surah Al-Kawthar, one of the shortest surahs in the Quran, beautifully demonstrates the difference between short and long vowels:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthara"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
/>

Notice the long, extended sounds in إِنَّآ (innā) and أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ (aʿṭaynāka). These aren't just short vowels — they're stretched out, held longer. The difference between a short "a" and a long "ā" can change the entire meaning of a word.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Distinguish between short and long vowels (alif, waw, ya as vowel carriers)
- Pronounce diphthongs (ay and aw)
- Read Quranic words containing long vowels correctly

**Connection:** In [Lesson 1.02: Short Vowels (Harakat)](/learn/level-1/02-short-vowels/), you learned the three short vowels: fatha (a), kasra (i), and damma (u). Now let's stretch them out to create long vowels.

## Understanding Long Vowels & Diphthongs

In English, we have short vowels like the "i" in "bit" and long vowels like the "ee" in "beat." Arabic works similarly — short vowels have long versions that last about twice as long when you pronounce them.

Think of it like the difference between the short "a" in "hat" and the long "a" in "father." Or the short "i" in "sit" and the long "ee" in "seat." Arabic marks this length difference explicitly using special letters called vowel carriers.

A long vowel in Arabic is created by combining a short vowel with a **vowel carrier letter**:

1. **Long A (ā)** = fatha (َ) + alif (ا) → "aa" sound
2. **Long I (ī)** = kasra (ِ) + ya (ي) → "ee" sound
3. **Long U (ū)** = damma (ُ) + waw (و) → "oo" sound

The letters alif, waw, and ya act as carriers — they stretch out the short vowel that comes before them.

### Diphthongs: Special Two-Part Vowels

Arabic also has two **diphthongs** — vowel sounds that glide from one sound to another:

1. **Diphthong AY** = fatha (َ) + ya (ي) with sukun → "ay" sound (like "eye")
2. **Diphthong AW** = fatha (َ) + waw (و) with sukun → "ow" sound (like "cow")

These are different from long vowels because they combine two different sounds into one smooth glide.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's examine long vowels and diphthongs in Surah Al-Kawthar.

**Example 1: Long ā (fatha + alif)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ"
  transliteration="innā"
  translation="Indeed, We"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="نَّآ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **إِ** (i) — Hamza below alif with kasra = "i"
- **نَّ** (nna) — Nun with shadda and fatha = "nna"
- **آ** (ā) — Alif with madda = long "ā"

The آ (alif with madda) creates a long "ā" sound, held for two beats. Compare this to نَ (na) with just fatha — the alif stretches it out to "nā."

**Example 2: Long ī (kasra + ya)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ"
  transliteration="aʿṭaynāka"
  translation="We have granted you"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="طَيْ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **أَ** (a) — Hamza with fatha = "a"
- **عْ** (ʿ) — Ayn with sukun = "ʿ"
- **طَ** (ṭa) — Ta emphatic with fatha = "ṭa"
- **يْ** (y) — Ya with sukun (diphthong ay) = "y"
- **نَٰ** (nā) — Nun with fatha + alif with dagger = "nā"
- **كَ** (ka) — Kaf with fatha = "ka"

Notice the يْ (ya with sukun) after fatha creates the diphthong "ay" sound.

**Example 3: Long ū (damma + waw)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="al-kawthara"
  translation="al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="وْ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **ٱلْ** (al) — Definite article
- **كَ** (ka) — Kaf with fatha = "ka"
- **وْ** (w) — Waw with sukun (creates "aw" diphthong)
- **ثَ** (tha) — Tha with fatha = "tha"
- **رَ** (ra) — Ra with fatha = "ra"

The كَوْ combines fatha on kaf with waw (sukun) to create the diphthong "aw" — like "cow."

**Example 4: Comparing short vs. long vowels**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ"
  transliteration="fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar"
  translation="So pray to your Lord and sacrifice"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:2"
  highlight="صَلِّ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **فَ** (fa) — Fa with fatha = short "a"
- **صَ** (ṣa) — Sad with fatha = short "a"
- **لِّ** (lli) — Lam with shadda and kasra = doubled "lli"

Compare صَلِّ (ṣalli) with short vowels to a word like قَالَْ (qāla) which has a long vowel. The alif in قَالَْ creates a stretched "ā," while صَلِّ has quick, short vowels.

**Example 5: Diphthong aw in action**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّ شَانِئَكَ هُوَ ٱلْأَبْتَرُ"
  transliteration="inna shāniʾaka huwa l-abtaru"
  translation="Indeed, your enemy is the one cut off"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:3"
  highlight="هُوَ"
/>

The word هُوَ (huwa) contains a long ū created by damma + waw: هُ (hu) + وَ (wa) = "huwa." The waw here acts as a vowel carrier for the damma before it.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Long Vowels & Diphthongs">

**Long vowels** are created by combining a short vowel with a vowel carrier letter:

1. Fatha (َ) + alif (ا) = ā (long "aa")
2. Kasra (ِ) + ya (ي) = ī (long "ee")
3. Damma (ُ) + waw (و) = ū (long "oo")

Hold the sound for about twice as long as a short vowel.

**Diphthongs** are two-part gliding vowels:

1. Fatha (َ) + ya with sukun (يْ) = ay (like "eye")
2. Fatha (َ) + waw with sukun (وْ) = aw (like "cow")

The difference: Long vowels use the carrier letter to extend a single sound. Diphthongs glide from one sound to another.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't confuse waw and ya as consonants vs. vowel carriers.** This is tricky because these letters have dual roles:

- When و has a vowel mark on it (وَ، وِ، وُ), it's a consonant: "wa," "wi," "wu"
- When و follows a damma and has no vowel mark, it's a vowel carrier: "ū"

Same with ya:
- With a vowel mark (يَ، يِ، يُ): consonant "ya," "yi," "yu"
- After kasra with no vowel mark: vowel carrier creating "ī"

Context is key. Look at the vowel mark on the letter BEFORE the waw or ya.

**Don't rush through long vowels.** Beginners often pronounce long vowels the same length as short vowels. Remember: long vowels are held for two beats. The difference between مَدَّ (madda - short vowels) and مَادَّ (mādda - long vowel) is critical for meaning.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="In the word إِنَّآ (innā), what creates the long ā sound at the end?">

**Answer:** Fatha + alif with madda (آ)

**Explanation:** The word إِنَّآ ends with آ, which is alif with madda. This creates a long ā sound.

Breaking it down:
- إِ (i) — hamza below alif with kasra = "i"
- نَّ (nna) — nun with shadda and fatha = "nna"
- آ (ā) — alif with madda = long "ā"

The madda symbol (ٓ) above the alif indicates a combination of hamza and long alif, creating the extended "ā" sound: "innā."

This is pronounced like "in-NAA" with the final vowel held for two beats.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="What is the difference between بِيْ (bay) and بِي (bī)?">

**Answer:**
- بَيْ (bay) = diphthong "ay" (fatha + ya with sukun)
- بِي (bī) = long vowel "ī" (kasra + ya)

**Explanation:** The difference comes from the vowel mark on the ba and whether the ya has sukun:

**بَيْ (bay):**
- بَ (ba) — ba with fatha = "ba"
- يْ (y) — ya with sukun = creates diphthong "y"
- Result: "bay" (glides from "a" to "y")

**بِي (bī):**
- بِ (bi) — ba with kasra = "bi"
- ي (ī) — ya as vowel carrier (no sukun) = extends kasra to "ī"
- Result: "bī" (long "ee" sound)

The key difference: sukun on ya makes it a diphthong component. No sukun makes it a long vowel carrier.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Identify all the long vowels in the word ٱلْكَوْثَرَ (al-kawthara).">

**Answer:** There are NO long vowels in this word, but there IS a diphthong.

**Explanation:** This is a trick question! Let's break down ٱلْكَوْثَرَ:

- ٱلْ (al) — definite article with alif wasla and lam with sukun
- كَ (ka) — kaf with fatha (short "a")
- وْ (w) — waw with sukun
- ثَ (tha) — tha with fatha (short "a")
- رَ (ra) — ra with fatha (short "a")

The combination كَوْ is fatha + waw with sukun = diphthong "aw," NOT a long vowel.

A long vowel would need the vowel carrier (waw) to have NO sukun and to follow a damma. For example:
- بُو (bū) — damma + waw (no sukun) = long ū
- But كَوْ — fatha + waw WITH sukun = diphthong aw

So "al-kawthara" has only short vowels and one diphthong, no long vowels.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Read and transliterate: فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ">

**Answer:** fa-ṣalli li-rabbika

**Detailed breakdown:**
- **فَ** (fa) — fa with fatha = "fa"
- **صَ** (ṣa) — sad with fatha = "ṣa"
- **لِّ** (lli) — lam with shadda and kasra = "lli"
- **لِ** (li) — lam with kasra = "li"
- **رَ** (ra) — ra with fatha = "ra"
- **بِّ** (bbi) — ba with shadda and kasra = "bbi"
- **كَ** (ka) — kaf with fatha = "ka"

**Complete pronunciation:** fa-ṣalli li-rabbika = "So pray to your Lord"

**Vowel analysis:**
- All vowels are SHORT — no long vowels in this phrase
- Shadda marks (ّ) double the consonant but don't create long vowels
- The kasra marks create quick "i" sounds

Compare this to a word with long vowels like قَالَْ (qāla), which has an alif extending the "a" sound. Here, everything is crisp and short.
