## Introduction

The opening verse of the Quran begins with beautiful connected letters flowing from right to left:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="bismi llāhi r-raḥmāni r-raḥīmi"
  translation="In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
/>

Notice how the letters connect to each other, flowing together like cursive handwriting. Each letter changes its shape depending on where it appears in the word. This is your first step toward reading the Quran in its original language.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize all 28 Arabic letters in isolated, initial, medial, and final forms
- Understand the concept of connecting letters in cursive Arabic script
- Distinguish between similar-looking letters (ba, ta, tha, jim, ha, kha)

**Connection:** This is your starting point. Mastering the alphabet unlocks every future lesson — you cannot read a single word without first knowing these 28 letters and their forms.

## Understanding the Arabic Alphabet

Arabic has 28 letters, similar to how English has 26. But unlike printed English letters that always look the same, Arabic letters CHANGE SHAPE depending on where they appear in a word. Think of it like English cursive handwriting, where letters connect and flow differently at the start, middle, and end of a word.

For example, the English cursive letter "s" looks different when it starts a word versus when it appears in the middle. Arabic works the same way, but this happens in all writing, not just cursive.

In Arabic, this writing system is called the [alphabet](/resources/glossary#huruf-al-hija) (ḥurūf al-hijāʾ / حُرُوفُ ٱلْهِجَاءِ). Each of the 28 letters can appear in up to four different forms:

1. **Isolated** — when the letter stands alone
2. **Initial** — when the letter starts a word
3. **Medial** — when the letter appears in the middle of a word
4. **Final** — when the letter ends a word

Most letters connect on both sides. However, six special letters — alif (ا), dal (د), dhal (ذ), ra (ر), zayn (ز), and waw (و) — only connect to the letter before them. These are called non-connecting letters, and they only have two forms instead of four (isolated and final).

## Examples from the Quran

Let's see how letters change forms in actual Quranic words. We'll use Surah Al-Fatiha, the opening chapter you'll memorize early in your journey.

**Example 1: The letter ba (ب) in different positions**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="بِسْمِ"
  transliteration="bismi"
  translation="In the name"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  highlight="بِ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **بِ** (bi) — Initial form of ba with kasra vowel
- **سْ** (s) — Medial form of sin with sukun
- **مِ** (mi) — Final form of mim with kasra

The letter ba (ب) starts the word, so it uses its initial form with a connecting stroke to the right.

**Example 2: The letter lam (ل) connecting to alif**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهِ"
  transliteration="llāhi"
  translation="Allah"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  highlight="ٱللَّهِ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **ٱ** — Alif wasla (special silent alif)
- **لْ** — Lam with sukun (first lam in al-)
- **لَّ** — Lam with fatha and shadda (doubled lam, name of Allah)
- **هِ** — Ha with kasra

Notice how the two lams connect together, and how they look different from the isolated letter ل.

**Example 3: Non-connecting letter waw (و)**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ"
  transliteration="rabbi l-ʿālamīna"
  translation="Lord of the worlds"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:2"
  highlight="ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ"
/>

In the word ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ʿālamīna), notice the alif (ا) and the alif with dagger (ٰ). These are non-connecting letters, so they create breaks in the word. The letter after them cannot connect backward.

**Example 4: Similar letters — ba, ta, tha**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ"
  transliteration="ar-raḥmāni"
  translation="the Most Gracious"
  reference="Al-Fatiha 1:1"
  highlight="ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ"
/>

The letters ba (ب), ta (ت), and tha (ث) have the same basic shape but differ only in the number and position of dots:
- ب (ba) — one dot below
- ت (ta) — two dots above
- ث (tha) — three dots above

**Example 5: Letter groups — jim, ha, kha**

Another group of similar letters: jim (ج), ha (ح), and kha (خ). They share the same curved shape:
- ج (jim) — one dot below
- ح (ha) — no dots
- خ (kha) — one dot above

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="The Four Forms of Arabic Letters">

Arabic letters have up to four forms depending on their position in a word:

1. **Isolated** — standing alone
2. **Initial** — starting a word (connects to the right)
3. **Medial** — in the middle (connects on both sides)
4. **Final** — ending a word (connects to the left)

Six letters (ا، د، ذ، ر، ز، و) are non-connecting — they only connect to the letter before them, so they have only two forms (isolated and final).

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't confuse similar letter groups.** Many beginners mix up these letters:
- ب/ت/ث (ba, ta, tha) — differ only by dots
- ج/ح/خ (jim, ha, kha) — differ only by dots
- د/ذ (dal, dhal) — differ only by one dot
- ر/ز (ra, zayn) — differ only by one dot
- س/ش (sin, shin) — differ only by three dots
- ص/ض (sad, dad) — differ only by one dot vs. position
- ط/ظ (ta emphatic, za emphatic) — differ only by one dot
- ع/غ (ayn, ghayn) — differ only by one dot

Pay close attention to the number and position of dots. They completely change the sound and meaning of the letter.

## All 28 Arabic Letters

Here is a table showing all 28 letters in their four forms:

**Note:** Non-connecting letters (alif, dal, dhal, ra, zayn, waw) have the same form for isolated and initial, and the same form for medial and final.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Which form of the letter mim (م) appears in the word بِسْمِ (bismi)?">

**Answer:** Final form (ـم)

**Explanation:** The letter mim (م) is the last letter in the word بِسْمِ. When a letter ends a word and connects to the letter before it, it uses its final form. The final form of mim is ـم, which connects to the sin (س) before it.

If you look at the table above, you'll see that isolated mim looks like this: م, but the final connected form is ـم.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="How many dots are on the letter tha (ث), and where are they positioned?">

**Answer:** Three dots above the letter

**Explanation:** The letter tha (ث) is part of the ba-ta-tha group. All three letters have the same basic shape, but they differ by dots:
- Ba (ب) — one dot below
- Ta (ت) — two dots above
- Tha (ث) — three dots above

The word "tha" sounds like "th" in the English word "think." It's different from "dh" (ذ), which sounds like "th" in "this."

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Why do the letters in ٱللَّهِ (Allah) connect together, but there's a break after the alif in ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ʿālamīna)?">

**Answer:** Alif is a non-connecting letter

**Explanation:** The letter alif (ا) is one of six non-connecting letters. It can only connect to the letter BEFORE it, but it cannot connect to the letter AFTER it. This creates a natural break in the word.

In the word ٱللَّهِ (Allah):
- The alif wasla (ٱ) at the beginning is silent and doesn't connect forward
- The two lams (لل) connect to each other
- The ha (ه) connects to the lam before it

In the word ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ʿālamīna):
- After the lam (ل), there's an ayn (ع)
- But there's a long alif (ٰ) with a dagger above it
- Alif doesn't connect forward, creating a break
- The remaining letters (لَمِينَ) connect together

The six non-connecting letters are: ا (alif), د (dal), ذ (dhal), ر (ra), ز (zayn), و (waw).

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="In the word ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (ar-raḥmāni), identify all four forms of letters that appear.">

**Answer:**
- **Isolated:** None in this word (all letters connect or are non-connecting finals)
- **Initial:** ٱلرَّ (alif-lam-ra) — the lam is in initial form لـ when it starts
- **Medial:** ـحـ (ha) — the ha (ح) connects on both sides
- **Final:** ـم، ـن، ـي (mim, nun, ya) — all three end sections and connect backward

**Detailed breakdown:**
- ٱ (alif wasla) — special initial form
- لْ (lam with sukun) — initial/medial form
- رَّ (ra with shadda) — non-connecting, so isolated/final form
- حْ (ha with sukun) — medial form (connects both sides)
- مَ (mim with fatha) — medial form
- ٰ (alif with dagger) — non-connecting
- نِ (nun with kasra) — final form

This word beautifully demonstrates how letters flow together while non-connecting letters create natural breaks in the script.
