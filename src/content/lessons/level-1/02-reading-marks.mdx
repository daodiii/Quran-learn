## Introduction

The opening verse of Surah Al-Masad packs nearly every reading mark into a single line — long vowels, sukun, shadda, and tanween all appear together:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ"
  transliteration="tabbat yadā abī lahabin wa-tabba"
  translation="May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "تَبَّتْ", tr: "tabbat", en: "may be ruined" },
    { ar: "يَدَآ", tr: "yadā", en: "the hands of" },
    { ar: "أَبِي", tr: "abī", en: "father of" },
    { ar: "لَهَبٍ", tr: "lahabin", en: "flame (Abu Lahab)" },
    { ar: "وَتَبَّ", tr: "wa-tabba", en: "and ruined is he" },
  ]}
/>

Look at what is happening in this verse: تَبَّتْ has a shadda (doubling the ba) and a sukun (silencing the final ta). The word يَدَآ ends with a long vowel. أَبِي contains a long ī. And لَهَبٍ ends with tanween — the double kasra creating an "-in" sound.

In [Lesson 1.01: Arabic Script & Vowels](/learn/level-1/01-arabic-script-vowels/), you learned the 28 letters and three short vowels (fatha, kasra, damma). Those short vowels are the foundation, but Arabic uses several more marks to control pronunciation. This lesson covers **all the remaining marks** — once you finish here, you will have the complete reading toolkit.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Stretch short vowels into long vowels using carrier letters (alif, waw, ya)
- Recognise diphthongs (ay, aw) — two-part gliding vowels
- Read sukun, the "silence" mark that removes a vowel
- Pronounce shadda, the "doubling" mark that repeats a consonant
- Understand tanween, the triple set of "-n" endings that mark indefinite words

<Callout type="tip" title="Why This Matters in Your Quran Reading">
Long vowels, sukun, shadda, and tanween appear on nearly every line of the Quran. Understanding these marks means you'll never mispronounce a word in recitation — each mark tells you exactly how the word sounds.

<Callout type="note" title="Quick Win">
Find the word ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ in Al-Fatiha. You can now identify: the shadda on رّ (doubled R), the long alif in مَٰ (long 'aa'), and the kasra on the final نِ. Every mark is telling you something.

## Part 1 — Long Vowels

A long vowel is simply a short vowel **held for two beats** instead of one. Arabic creates long vowels by pairing a short vowel with a **carrier letter**:

1. **Long ā** = fatha (َ) + alif (ا) — like the "a" in "father," held longer
2. **Long ī** = kasra (ِ) + ya (ي) — like "ee" in "see," held longer
3. **Long ū** = damma (ُ) + waw (و) — like "oo" in "moon," held longer

The carrier letter itself has no vowel mark of its own — its only job is to extend the short vowel before it.

<GrammarTable
  caption="Short Vowels vs. Long Vowels"
  headers={["Short Vowel", "Mark", "Long Vowel", "Carrier Letter", "Example"]}
  rows={[
    ["a (fatha)", "َ", "ā", "ا (alif)", "بَا (bā)"],
    ["i (kasra)", "ِ", "ī", "ي (ya)", "بِي (bī)"],
    ["u (damma)", "ُ", "ū", "و (waw)", "بُو (bū)"]
  ]}
/>

**Quranic example — Long ā (fatha + alif):**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّآ أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthara"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "إِنَّآ", tr: "innā", en: "Indeed, We" },
    { ar: "أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ", tr: "aʿṭaynāka", en: "have granted you" },
    { ar: "ٱلْكَوْثَرَ", tr: "l-kawthara", en: "al-Kawthar (abundance)" },
  ]}
/>

In إِنَّآ (innā), the آ (alif with madda) creates a long ā — held for two beats. In أَعْطَيْنَٰكَ, the dagger alif above the nun also creates a long ā: "aʿṭay-**nā**-ka."

**Quranic example — Long ī (kasra + ya):**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَبِي لَهَبٍ"
  transliteration="abī lahabin"
  translation="father of flame (Abu Lahab)"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "أَبِي", tr: "abī", en: "father of" },
    { ar: "لَهَبٍ", tr: "lahabin", en: "flame (Abu Lahab)" },
  ]}
/>

In أَبِي (abī), the kasra on the ba pairs with the ya to create a long ī — the stretched "ee" sound: "a-**bī**."

---

## Part 2 — Diphthongs

Arabic has two **diphthongs** — vowel sounds that glide from one sound to another rather than holding a single tone:

1. **ay** = fatha (َ) + ya with sukun (يْ) — like "eye"
2. **aw** = fatha (َ) + waw with sukun (وْ) — like "ow" in "cow"

The key difference from long vowels: a long vowel extends **one** sound, while a diphthong **glides between two** sounds.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="al-kawthara"
  translation="al-Kawthar (abundance)"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱلْكَوْثَرَ", tr: "al-kawthara", en: "al-Kawthar (abundance)" },
  ]}
/>

The كَوْ in ٱلْكَوْثَرَ is fatha on kaf + waw with sukun — the diphthong "aw," gliding from "a" into "w." This is NOT a long vowel. A long ū would need damma before the waw, not fatha.

---

## Part 3 — Sukun: The Silence Mark

Sometimes a consonant has **no vowel** after it — like the "k" in "ask" or the "b" in "cab." In Arabic this is marked explicitly with a small circle (ـْ) above the letter, called sukun (stillness).

When you see sukun, pronounce the consonant and stop immediately — no "a," "i," or "u" follows.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="تَبَّتْ يَدَآ"
  transliteration="tabbat yadā"
  translation="May the hands be ruined"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "تَبَّتْ", tr: "tabbat", en: "may be ruined" },
    { ar: "يَدَآ", tr: "yadā", en: "the hands of" },
  ]}
/>

The final تْ in تَبَّتْ has sukun — you say "tabbat" not "tabbata." The sukun stops the word cleanly on the "t" consonant.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُ مَالُهُۥ"
  transliteration="mā aghnā ʿanhu māluhu"
  translation="His wealth will not avail him"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:2"
  words={[
    { ar: "مَآ", tr: "mā", en: "not" },
    { ar: "أَغْنَىٰ", tr: "aghnā", en: "avail" },
    { ar: "عَنْهُ", tr: "ʿanhu", en: "from him" },
    { ar: "مَالُهُۥ", tr: "māluhu", en: "his wealth" },
  ]}
/>

In أَغْنَىٰ, the ghayn (غْ) has sukun — you pronounce "gh" and immediately move to the next letter: "**agh**-nā." In عَنْهُ, the nun (نْ) has sukun: "**ʿan**-hu."

---

## Part 4 — Shadda: The Doubling Mark

A small "w" shape (ـّ) above a letter means you pronounce that consonant **twice** — like the double "t" in "butter" or double "n" in "dinner." This is called shadda (strengthening).

**Important:** A letter with shadda always **also** carries a vowel mark. The shadda doubles the consonant, and the accompanying vowel tells you what sound follows:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَتَبَّ"
  transliteration="wa-tabba"
  translation="and ruined is he"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَتَبَّ", tr: "wa-tabba", en: "and ruined is he" },
  ]}
/>

The بَّ in وَتَبَّ has shadda + fatha. You pronounce "b" twice, then add the "a" vowel: "tab-**ba**." Compare this with just بَ (ba) — one "b" — versus بَّ (bba) — two "b"s. The doubling changes meaning: dropping a shadda can turn one word into a completely different one.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="حَمَّالَةَ ٱلْحَطَبِ"
  transliteration="ḥammālata l-ḥaṭabi"
  translation="carrier of firewood"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:4"
  words={[
    { ar: "حَمَّالَةَ", tr: "ḥammālata", en: "carrier of" },
    { ar: "ٱلْحَطَبِ", tr: "l-ḥaṭabi", en: "firewood" },
  ]}
/>

In حَمَّالَةَ, the mim (مَّ) has shadda + fatha — doubled mim with "a" sound: "ḥam-**mā**-la-ta." Notice how the shadda sits alongside a long vowel (the alif after the mim) — multiple mark types working together in one word.

---

## Part 5 — Tanween: The "-n" Ending

Tanween adds an "-n" sound to the end of a word, signalling that the word is **indefinite** — "a book" rather than "the book." It appears as a doubled vowel mark and comes in three forms matching the three short vowels:

<GrammarTable
  caption="The Three Forms of Tanween"
  headers={["Name", "Mark", "Sound", "Example", "Pronunciation"]}
  rows={[
    ["Fathatain", "ً", "-an", "رَجُلًا", "rajulan"],
    ["Kasratain", "ٍ", "-in", "رَجُلٍ", "rajulin"],
    ["Dammatain", "ٌ", "-un", "رَجُلٌ", "rajulun"]
  ]}
/>

Think of tanween as "nunation" — the Arabic term tanwin literally means "adding a nun (n) sound." You will learn the grammatical reasons behind each form in later lessons. For now, just recognise the marks and pronounce the "-n" ending.

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَبِي لَهَبٍ"
  transliteration="abī lahabin"
  translation="father of flame (Abu Lahab)"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "أَبِي", tr: "abī", en: "father of" },
    { ar: "لَهَبٍ", tr: "lahabin", en: "flame (Abu Lahab)" },
  ]}
/>

The kasratain (ٍ) on the final ba of لَهَبٍ creates the "-in" ending: "lahab-**in**." This tells you "lahab" is indefinite. If it were definite ("the flame"), it would use the definite article instead: ٱلْلَهَبِ with just one kasra and no tanween.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="The Complete Reading Mark System">

Beyond the three short vowels, Arabic uses five more mark types. Together they give you everything you need to read any vowelled text:

**Long vowels** — A short vowel + a carrier letter, held for two beats:
- Fatha + alif = ā &nbsp;|&nbsp; Kasra + ya = ī &nbsp;|&nbsp; Damma + waw = ū

**Diphthongs** — Fatha + ya/waw with sukun, gliding between two sounds:
- Fatha + ya (sukun) = ay &nbsp;|&nbsp; Fatha + waw (sukun) = aw

**Sukun (ـْ)** — Small circle above a letter. No vowel follows — pronounce the consonant and stop.

**Shadda (ـّ)** — Small "w" shape above a letter. Double the consonant, then add the accompanying vowel mark.

**Tanween (ـً ـٍ ـٌ)** — Double vowel mark at the end of a word, creating an "-n" sound that marks indefiniteness:
- Fathatain = -an &nbsp;|&nbsp; Kasratain = -in &nbsp;|&nbsp; Dammatain = -un

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Confusing waw/ya as consonants vs. carrier letters.** When waw or ya carries its own vowel mark (وَ, يَ), it is a regular consonant. When it follows a matching short vowel and has no mark of its own, it is a vowel carrier creating a long vowel. Always check the mark on the letter **before** the waw or ya.

**Rushing long vowels.** Beginners often make long vowels the same length as short ones. Hold long vowels for two beats — the length difference changes meaning.

**Pronouncing shadda as a single consonant.** Shadda means **two** instances of the letter. Say "tab-bat" not "tabat." Think of English "latter" vs. "later."

**Mixing up tanween with regular vowels.** Tanween is a **double** mark (ً ٍ ٌ) while a regular vowel is a single mark (َ ِ ُ). The double creates the "-n" ending. Tanween only appears at the end of words.

**Adding a vowel where sukun belongs.** When you see the small circle, the consonant has no vowel — pronounce it and stop. Do not add an "a" or "i" out of habit.

</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="In the word إِنَّآ (innā), what creates the long ā sound at the end?">

**Answer:** The alif with madda (آ).

The آ is a combination of hamza + long alif, producing an extended ā sound held for two beats:
- إِ (i) — hamza below alif with kasra
- نَّ (nna) — nun with shadda and fatha (doubled consonant)
- آ (ā) — alif with madda = long "ā"

Pronunciation: "in-**naa**" with the final vowel stretched.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="What is the difference between بَيْ (bay) and بِي (bī)?">

**Answer:**
- بَيْ (bay) = diphthong "ay" — fatha on ba + ya with sukun. The sound glides from "a" to "y."
- بِي (bī) = long vowel "ī" — kasra on ba + ya as vowel carrier. The sound is a single extended "ee."

The key: look at the vowel on the ba and whether the ya has sukun. Fatha + ya (sukun) = diphthong. Kasra + ya (no sukun) = long vowel.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="In the word تَبَّتْ (tabbat), identify every mark and explain what each one does.">

**Answer:** tabbat — three marks are at work:

1. **Fatha (َ)** on the first ta — short "a" vowel: "**ta**"
2. **Shadda (ّ) + fatha (َ)** on the ba — doubles the consonant and gives it an "a" vowel: "**bba**"
3. **Sukun (ْ)** on the final ta — no vowel, just the consonant: "**t**"

Together: ta + bba + t = "tab-bat." Shadda strengthens one consonant while sukun silences the vowel on another — two different marks doing opposite jobs in the same word.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Read and fully analyse this phrase, identifying every mark type: فَصَلِّ لِرَبِّكَ وَٱنْحَرْ">

**Answer:** fa-ṣalli li-rabbika wa-nḥar

**Mark-by-mark breakdown:**
- **فَ** — fa with fatha (short vowel): "fa"
- **صَ** — sad with fatha (short vowel): "ṣa"
- **لِّ** — lam with shadda + kasra (doubled consonant + short vowel): "lli"
- **لِ** — lam with kasra (short vowel): "li"
- **رَ** — ra with fatha (short vowel): "ra"
- **بِّ** — ba with shadda + kasra (doubled consonant + short vowel): "bbi"
- **كَ** — kaf with fatha (short vowel): "ka"
- **وَ** — waw with fatha (consonant, not a vowel carrier): "wa"
- **ٱنْ** — alif wasla + nun with sukun (silent mark): "n" with no vowel
- **حَ** — ha with fatha (short vowel): "ḥa"
- **رْ** — ra with sukun (silent mark): "r" with no vowel

**Marks found:** fatha, kasra, shadda (x2), sukun (x2). No long vowels, no diphthongs, no tanween — all short vowels with shadda and sukun.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the tanween in لَهَبٍ (lahabin), name its form, and explain what it tells you about the word.">

**Answer:** The mark is **kasratain** (ٍ) — two kasra marks creating the "-in" ending.

Breakdown:
- لَ (la) — lam with fatha
- هَ (ha) — ha with fatha
- بٍ (bin) — ba with kasratain (tanween)

Pronunciation: "lahab-**in**"

**What it tells you:** Tanween marks the word as **indefinite** — "a flame / flame" rather than "the flame." If the word were definite, it would have the definite article (ال) and a single kasra instead of tanween: ٱلْلَهَبِ (al-lahabi).
