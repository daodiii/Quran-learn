## Introduction

In Surah Al-Masad, you'll notice three special marks that change how words sound — marks that show when there's NO vowel, when a consonant is DOUBLED, and when a word ends with an "-n" sound:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="تَبَّتْ يَدَآ أَبِي لَهَبٍ وَتَبَّ"
  transliteration="tabbat yadā abī lahabin wa-tabba"
  translation="May the hands of Abu Lahab be ruined, and ruined is he"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
/>

Notice تَبَّتْ (tabbat) — the ba has a small "w" shape (shadda) showing it's doubled, and the ta at the end has a small circle (sukun) showing it has no vowel. Meanwhile لَهَبٍ (lahabin) ends with two kasras (tanween) creating an "-in" sound.

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Recognize sukun (vowel absence) and its pronunciation effect
- Pronounce shadda (consonant doubling) correctly
- Understand tanween (nunation) and its three forms

**Connection:** In [Lesson 1.02: Short Vowels (Harakat)](/learn/level-1/02-short-vowels/), you learned that every consonant carries a vowel mark. But what happens when there's NO vowel? And how do we show a doubled consonant or an "-n" ending? These three special marks complete your reading toolkit.

## Understanding Sukun, Shadda & Tanween

### Sukun: The Silence Mark

Sometimes a consonant has NO vowel after it — like the "k" in "ask" or the "p" in "help." The consonant sounds, but there's no "a," "i," or "u" following it. In English we just don't write a vowel. In Arabic, we mark this silence explicitly.

Think of sukun as a "stop sign" for the voice. When you see the small circle (ـْ) above a letter, you pronounce the consonant but immediately stop — no vowel follows.

In Arabic grammar, this mark is called [sukun](/resources/glossary/#sukun) (sukūn / سُكُونْ). It literally means "stillness" or "rest."

**Example:**
- مِنْ (min) — the nun has sukun, so it's "min" not "mina" or "minu"
- قُلْ (qul) — the lam has sukun, so it's "qul" not "qula" or "quli"

### Shadda: The Doubling Mark

Sometimes you need to say a consonant TWICE, like the double "t" in "butter" or double "n" in "dinner." Arabic marks this doubling with a small "w" shape (ـّ) above the letter. This is critical — in English, "later" vs "latter" changes meaning. Arabic works the same way.

Think of shadda as telling you to hold the consonant for two beats instead of one. It's not just emphasis — it's an actual doubling of the sound.

In Arabic grammar, this mark is called [shadda](/resources/glossary/#shadda) (shaddah / شَدَّةٌ). It means "strengthening" or "emphasis."

**Example:**
- رَبٌّ (rabbun) — the ba is doubled, so you pronounce both: "rab-bun"
- مُحَمَّدٌ (Muḥammadun) — the mim is doubled: "Muḥam-madun"

**Important:** A letter with shadda ALSO has a vowel mark. The shadda doubles the consonant, then you add the vowel:
- رَبِّ (rabbi) — shadda + kasra = doubled ba with "i" sound

### Tanween: The "-n" Ending

Tanween adds an "-n" sound to the end of a word, similar to how English uses "a/an" before nouns. It signals that the word is indefinite (not a specific thing). For example, "a book" (any book) vs "the book" (a specific book).

Think of tanween as a double vowel mark that creates an "-n" at the end. In English we'd say "a book-an" to show it's indefinite — that's basically what tanween does.

In Arabic grammar, this is called [tanween](/resources/glossary/#tanween) (tanwīn / تَنْوِينٌ), which means "nunation" (adding the "n" sound). It comes in three forms, matching the three vowels:

1. **Fathatain** (ـً) — double fatha = "-an" sound
2. **Kasratain** (ـٍ) — double kasra = "-in" sound
3. **Dammatain** (ـٌ) — double damma = "-un" sound

    ["Dammatain", "ٌ", "-un", "رَجُلٌ", "rajulun"]
  ]}
/>

## Examples from the Quran

Let's see these marks in action in Surah Al-Masad, which has prominent examples of all three.

**Example 1: Sukun showing no vowel**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="تَبَّتْ يَدَآ"
  transliteration="tabbat yadā"
  translation="May the hands be ruined"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  highlight="تْ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **تَ** (ta) — ta with fatha = "ta"
- **بَّ** (bba) — ba with shadda and fatha = "bba" (doubled)
- **تْ** (t) — ta with sukun = just "t" with no vowel

The final تْ has sukun, so you say "tabbat" not "tabbata."

**Example 2: Shadda doubling a consonant**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="تَبَّتْ"
  transliteration="tabbat"
  translation="may be ruined"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  highlight="بَّ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **تَ** (ta) — ta with fatha = "ta"
- **بَّ** (bba) — ba with shadda + fatha = "bba"
- **تْ** (t) — ta with sukun = "t"

The ba has shadda, meaning you pronounce it twice: "tab-bat" not "tabat." Feel the emphasis on the doubled consonant.

**Example 3: Tanween with kasra**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَبِي لَهَبٍ"
  transliteration="abī lahabin"
  translation="Abu Lahab"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:1"
  highlight="لَهَبٍ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **لَ** (la) — lam with fatha = "la"
- **هَ** (ha) — ha with fatha = "ha"
- **بٍ** (bin) — ba with kasratain (tanween) = "bin"

The kasratain (ٍ) on the final ba creates the "-in" ending: "lahabin." This tells you "lahab" is indefinite.

**Example 4: Combining sukun and shadda**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="مَآ أَغْنَىٰ عَنْهُ مَالُهُۥ وَمَا كَسَبَ"
  transliteration="mā aghnā ʿanhu māluhu wa-mā kasaba"
  translation="His wealth will not avail him or that which he gained"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:2"
  highlight="أَغْنَىٰ"
/>

**Breakdown of أَغْنَىٰ:**
- **أَ** (a) — hamza with fatha = "a"
- **غْ** (gh) — ghayn with sukun = "gh" (no vowel)
- **نَىٰ** (nā) — nun with fatha + alif with dagger alif = "nā"

The ghayn has sukun, stopping the sound: "agh-nā" not "aghā-nā."

**Example 5: Tanween with damma**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="حَمَّالَةَ ٱلْحَطَبِ"
  transliteration="ḥammālata l-ḥaṭabi"
  translation="carrier of firewood"
  reference="Al-Masad 111:4"
  highlight="حَمَّالَةَ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **حَ** (ḥa) — ha with fatha = "ḥa"
- **مَّ** (mma) — mim with shadda and fatha = "mma"
- **ا** (ā) — alif = long vowel
- **لَ** (la) — lam with fatha = "la"
- **ةَ** (ta) — ta marbuta with fatha = "ta"

This word shows shadda (on the mim) combined with other marks. Notice how the doubled mim creates emphasis: "ḥam-mālah."

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="Sukun, Shadda & Tanween">

**Sukun (ـْ)** — A small circle above a letter showing it has NO vowel. Pronounce the consonant and stop immediately.

**Shadda (ـّ)** — A small "w" shape above a letter showing it is DOUBLED. Pronounce the consonant twice. Shadda always combines with a vowel mark (fatha, kasra, or damma).

**Tanween (ـً ـٍ ـٌ)** — Double vowel marks at the end of indefinite words, creating an "-n" sound:
- Fathatain (ـً) = -an
- Kasratain (ـٍ) = -in
- Dammatain (ـٌ) = -un

These three marks complete your reading system: short vowels, long vowels, no vowel (sukun), doubled consonants (shadda), and indefinite endings (tanween).

**Related:** [Lesson 1.02: Short Vowels](/learn/level-1/02-short-vowels/) for the vowel marks that combine with shadda

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't forget to double the consonant on shadda.** Many beginners see the shadda but only pronounce the consonant once. Remember: shadda means you say the letter TWICE. Test yourself: say "later" (one 't') vs "latter" (two 't's) — hear the difference? Apply that same doubling in Arabic.

**Don't confuse tanween with regular vowels.** Tanween is TWO marks (ً ٍ ٌ) while regular vowels are ONE mark (َ ِ ُ). The double mark creates the "-n" sound at the end. Also, tanween ONLY appears at the end of words, never in the middle.

**Don't skip the sukun.** When you see sukun, that letter has NO vowel — pronounce it and move on. Beginners often add a vowel anyway out of habit. Train yourself: when you see ـْ, stop the voice immediately after the consonant.

</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="In the word تَبَّتْ (tabbat), what three special marks do you see, and what does each do?">

**Answer:**

1. **Shadda (ّ)** on the ba — doubles the consonant
2. **Fatha (َ)** on the ba (under the shadda) — gives it the "a" vowel
3. **Sukun (ْ)** on the final ta — shows it has no vowel

**Explanation:** This word demonstrates two marks at once:

The ba (ب) has TWO marks: shadda (ّ) above and fatha (َ) below it. The shadda doubles the ba, and the fatha tells you the doubled ba has the "a" sound: "babba."

The final ta (ت) has sukun (ْ), meaning it has no vowel — just the "t" sound and stop.

Together: ta + doubled ba with "a" + ta with no vowel = "tabbat"

This is how shadda and sukun work together in the same word — shadda strengthens a consonant, sukun silences the vowel on another.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="What is the difference between بَ (ba), بَّ (doubled ba), and بْ (ba with sukun)?">

**Answer:**

- **بَ** (ba) — ba with fatha = "ba" sound
- **بَّ** (bba) — ba with shadda + fatha = doubled "bba" sound
- **بْ** (b) — ba with sukun = just "b" with no vowel

**Explanation:** These three demonstrate the difference between voweled, doubled, and silent consonants:

**بَ (ba):** Regular consonant with vowel — one ba followed by "a" sound

**بَّ (bba):** Shadda doubles the consonant, fatha adds vowel — you pronounce "b" then "ba" = "bba." It's like saying "ebb-a" in English where the "b" is held for two beats.

**بْ (b):** Sukun removes the vowel — you say "b" and stop immediately, like the "b" in "cab" with no vowel after it.

This shows how these marks radically change pronunciation of the same letter.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Identify the tanween form in لَهَبٍ (lahabin) and explain what it tells you about the word.">

**Answer:** Kasratain (ٍ) — two kasra marks = "-in" ending

**Explanation:** The word لَهَبٍ (lahab) ends with kasratain:

- **لَ** (la) — lam with fatha
- **هَ** (ha) — ha with fatha
- **بٍ** (bin) — ba with kasratain (tanween)

The double kasra (ٍ) creates the "-in" sound, making it "lahabin."

**What it tells you:** This tanween indicates the word is INDEFINITE. If it were definite (like "THE flame"), it would be ٱلْلَهَبِ (al-lahabi) with the definite article and just one kasra, no tanween.

Tanween always marks indefinite nouns. You'll learn more about definiteness in later lessons, but for now, remember: tanween = indefinite, no tanween = might be definite.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Read this word and identify all the special marks: تَبَّتْ">

**Answer:** tabbat

**Breakdown with all marks:**

**تَبَّتْ** (tabbat)
- **تَ** (ta) — ta with fatha = "ta"
- **بَّ** (bba) — ba with shadda + fatha = "bba" (doubled consonant)
- **تْ** (t) — ta with sukun = "t" (no vowel)

**Special marks analysis:**

This word demonstrates ALL THREE special marks we learned in this lesson:

1. **Fatha (َ)** — regular short vowel on the first ta
2. **Shadda (ّ)** — doubling mark on the ba, making it "bb" not "b"
3. **Sukun (ْ)** — silence mark on the final ta, stopping the vowel

Together these create: ta + doubled ba with "a" + ta with no vowel = "tab-bat"

This is the perfect example of how sukun and shadda work together in one word — shadda strengthens a consonant (doubles it), while sukun removes the vowel from another letter entirely.

**Complete pronunciation:** tabbat = "may be ruined"
