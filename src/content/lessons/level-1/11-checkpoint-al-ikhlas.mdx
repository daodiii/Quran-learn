## Your First Complete Surah Analysis

Congratulations — you have made it to the end of Level 1. That is a real achievement. You now have a toolkit of foundational Arabic grammar concepts, and it is time to put every one of them to work.

In this lesson, there is no new grammar. Instead, you will apply what you already know to analyze Surah Al-Ikhlas (112) — all four verses, word by word. This is your first complete surah analysis, and you might be surprised by how much you can already identify.

**Here is what you are bringing to this checkpoint:**
- Arabic script and vowels ([L1.01](/learn/level-1/01-arabic-script-vowels/))
- Reading marks including tanween and sukun ([L1.02](/learn/level-1/02-reading-marks/))
- Three word types: noun, verb, particle ([L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-three-word-types/))
- Root system awareness ([L1.05](/learn/level-1/05-root-system-preview/))
- Definite vs. indefinite ([L1.06](/learn/level-1/06-definite-article/))
- Gender: masculine and feminine ([L1.07](/learn/level-1/07-gender-masculine-feminine/))
- Number: singular, dual, plural ([L1.08](/learn/level-1/08-singular-dual-plural/))
- Simple sentences ([L1.09](/learn/level-1/09-simple-sentences/))
- Case endings ([L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/))

Let's see how far these tools take you.

## The Complete Surah

Surah Al-Ikhlas is one of the most beloved and frequently recited surahs in the Quran. It is only four verses and fifteen words — but it contains the purest statement of monotheism in the entire Quran. Read through it first, then we will analyze every word together.

**Verse 1:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say, 'He is Allah, [who is] One'"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  words={[
    { ar: "قُلْ", tr: "qul", en: "Say" },
    { ar: "هُوَ", tr: "huwa", en: "He" },
    { ar: "ٱللَّهُ", tr: "llāhu", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "أَحَدٌ", tr: "aḥadun", en: "One" }
  ]}
/>

**Verse 2:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="allāhu ṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="Allah, the Eternal Refuge"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  words={[
    { ar: "ٱللَّهُ", tr: "allāhu", en: "Allah" },
    { ar: "ٱلصَّمَدُ", tr: "aṣ-ṣamadu", en: "the Eternal Refuge" }
  ]}
/>

**Verse 3:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ"
  transliteration="lam yalid wa-lam yūlad"
  translation="He neither begets nor is born"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:3"
  words={[
    { ar: "لَمْ", tr: "lam", en: "not" },
    { ar: "يَلِدْ", tr: "yalid", en: "beget" },
    { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "and" },
    { ar: "لَمْ", tr: "lam", en: "not" },
    { ar: "يُولَدْ", tr: "yūlad", en: "is born" }
  ]}
/>

**Verse 4:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="wa-lam yakun lahū kufuwan aḥadun"
  translation="Nor is there to Him any equivalent"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:4"
  words={[
    { ar: "وَ", tr: "wa", en: "And" },
    { ar: "لَمْ", tr: "lam", en: "not" },
    { ar: "يَكُن", tr: "yakun", en: "is" },
    { ar: "لَّهُۥ", tr: "lahū", en: "to Him" },
    { ar: "كُفُوًا", tr: "kufuwan", en: "equivalent" },
    { ar: "أَحَدٌ", tr: "aḥadun", en: "anyone" }
  ]}
/>

Now — let's go through every word with your Level 1 toolkit.

## Guided Word-by-Word Analysis

### Verse 1: قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ

This verse opens with a command and then delivers the core message of the surah in a single nominal sentence.

<GrammarTable>
| Word | Type | Definite? | Gender | Number | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| قُلْ | Verb (command) | — | — | — | Command form meaning "Say!" — ends with sukun (ـْ) |
| هُوَ | Noun (pronoun) | — | Masculine | Singular | Pronoun meaning "He" — pronouns are a type of noun (ism) |
| ٱللَّهُ | Noun | Definite (proper name) | Masculine | Singular | Nominative case: ends with damma (ـُ) |
| أَحَدٌ | Noun/Adjective | Indefinite (tanween ـٌ) | Masculine | Singular | Nominative case: tanween damma (ـٌ) means "One" |
</GrammarTable>

**What you can spot here:**
- **قُلْ** is a verb — it shows an action (speaking) and gives a command. You can see the sukun (ـْ) on the lam.
- **هُوَ** is a pronoun. Remember from [L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-three-word-types/) that pronouns count as nouns (isms) in Arabic.
- **ٱللَّهُ** is a definite noun with a damma ending (ـُ), which is the nominative case you learned in [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/).
- **أَحَدٌ** has tanween (ـٌ), which tells you two things at once: it is indefinite ([L1.06](/learn/level-1/06-definite-article/)) and it is nominative ([L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/)).

### Verse 2: ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ

The shortest verse in the surah — just two words. Both are definite nouns in the nominative case.

<GrammarTable>
| Word | Type | Definite? | Gender | Number | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| ٱللَّهُ | Noun | Definite (proper name) | Masculine | Singular | Nominative (ـُ) — same as verse 1 |
| ٱلصَّمَدُ | Noun/Adjective | Definite (has ال) | Masculine | Singular | Nominative (ـُ) — "the Eternal Refuge" |
</GrammarTable>

**What you can spot here:**
- Both words end with damma (ـُ) — nominative case.
- **ٱلصَّمَدُ** has the definite article ال. Remember from [L1.06](/learn/level-1/06-definite-article/) that the ص is a sun letter, so the lam of ال assimilates into it (that is why you see the shadda: ٱلصَّمَدُ).
- This is a nominal sentence — no verb at all, just like the pattern you learned in [L1.09](/learn/level-1/09-simple-sentences/).
- Both words are masculine singular — the entire surah speaks about Allah using masculine forms, as you would expect from [L1.07](/learn/level-1/07-gender-masculine-feminine/).

### Verse 3: لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ

This verse is all verbs and particles — not a single noun. It powerfully negates two actions.

<GrammarTable>
| Word | Type | Definite? | Gender | Number | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| لَمْ | Particle (negation) | — | — | — | Negates present-tense verbs — turns them to past negation |
| يَلِدْ | Verb (present tense) | — | Masculine | Singular | "begets" — the يـ prefix marks present tense |
| وَ | Particle (conjunction) | — | — | — | "and" — the most common Arabic particle |
| لَمْ | Particle (negation) | — | — | — | Same negation particle, repeated |
| يُولَدْ | Verb (present tense, passive) | — | Masculine | Singular | "is born" — passive voice of the same root |
</GrammarTable>

**What you can spot here:**
- **لَمْ** is a particle — it has no meaning on its own and fails every noun and verb test from [L1.04](/learn/level-1/04-three-word-types/).
- **يَلِدْ** and **يُولَدْ** are verbs — they show actions bound to time. The يـ prefix is a marker of present-tense verbs.
- **وَ** is the conjunction particle you have seen many times already.
- Notice something interesting about the roots: both **يَلِدْ** and **يُولَدْ** come from the same root و-ل-د (related to birth/begetting). This is the root system from [L1.05](/learn/level-1/05-root-system-preview/) in action — the same root appears in active voice ("begets") and passive voice ("is born").

### Verse 4: وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ

The longest verse in the surah brings together particles, a verb, a preposition with a pronoun, and two nouns.

<GrammarTable>
| Word | Type | Definite? | Gender | Number | Notes |
|------|------|-----------|--------|--------|-------|
| وَ | Particle (conjunction) | — | — | — | "And" — connects to the previous verse |
| لَمْ | Particle (negation) | — | — | — | Same negation particle as verse 3 |
| يَكُن | Verb (present tense) | — | — | Singular | "is/be" — shortened form after لَمْ |
| لَّهُۥ | Preposition + pronoun | — | Masculine | Singular | لِ (to/for) + هُ (him) — "to Him" |
| كُفُوًا | Noun | Indefinite (tanween ـً) | Masculine | Singular | Accusative case (tanween fatha ـً) — "equivalent" |
| أَحَدٌ | Noun | Indefinite (tanween ـٌ) | Masculine | Singular | Nominative case (tanween damma ـٌ) — "anyone" |
</GrammarTable>

**What you can spot here:**
- **كُفُوًا** has tanween fatha (ـً), which tells you it is both indefinite AND in the accusative case ([L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/)).
- **أَحَدٌ** has tanween damma (ـٌ), which is the nominative case — a different case ending from كُفُوًا even though both are indefinite.
- **لَّهُۥ** is a preposition (لِ) attached to a pronoun (هُ). The preposition is a particle, and the pronoun is a noun — two word types fused into one written form.
- The same word **أَحَدٌ** appears in both verse 1 and verse 4, creating a beautiful frame around the surah.

<Callout type="tip" title="What You Just Accomplished">

Take a moment to appreciate what you just did. You analyzed all 15 words of Surah Al-Ikhlas using only your Level 1 tools:

- **Three word types identified** — nouns, verbs, and particles across all four verses
- **Definite vs. indefinite recognized** — you spotted tanween on indefinite words and ال on definite ones
- **Case endings read** — nominative (ـُ/ـٌ) and accusative (ـً) identified correctly
- **Gender recognized** — masculine forms throughout the surah
- **Number identified** — singular forms throughout
- **Root connections spotted** — يَلِدْ and يُولَدْ sharing the root و-ل-د
- **15 words analyzed** using Level 1 knowledge alone

This is real Quranic Arabic analysis. You are reading the Quran with understanding, not just recitation.

## What's Coming Next

<Callout type="info" title="A Preview of Deeper Understanding">

You have done an impressive analysis, but there is much more to uncover in this surah as you progress through the course:

- **Level 2 — Sentence Types:** You will learn why هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ is a nominal sentence (it starts with a pronoun, not a verb) and why ٱللَّهُ ٱلصَّمَدُ works as a complete sentence with no verb at all.

- **Level 3 — Verb Conjugation:** You will fully understand يَلِدْ and يُولَدْ — how the present tense is formed, how passive voice changes the vowel pattern, and why لَمْ causes the ending to drop.

- **Level 5 — Rhetorical Analysis:** You will return to this surah for a full rhetorical (balagha) analysis — why أَحَدٌ was chosen over وَاحِدٌ, why the surah uses negation in the second half, and how the structure mirrors its theological message.

Each level will reveal new layers in these same fifteen words.

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="Count all the nouns, verbs, and particles in Surah Al-Ikhlas. Go through all four verses and tally up each word type.">

**Answer:**

**Nouns (approximately 6):**
1. هُوَ — pronoun (verse 1)
2. ٱللَّهُ — proper noun (verse 1)
3. أَحَدٌ — noun/adjective (verse 1)
4. ٱللَّهُ — proper noun (verse 2)
5. ٱلصَّمَدُ — noun/adjective (verse 2)
6. كُفُوًا — noun (verse 4)
7. أَحَدٌ — noun (verse 4)

Note: لَّهُۥ contains a pronoun (هُ), which is also a noun — so depending on how you count, there are 6-7 nouns.

**Verbs (4):**
1. قُلْ — command verb (verse 1)
2. يَلِدْ — present tense verb (verse 3)
3. يُولَدْ — present tense passive verb (verse 3)
4. يَكُن — present tense verb (verse 4)

**Particles (approximately 5):**
1. لَمْ — negation particle (verse 3, first occurrence)
2. وَ — conjunction (verse 3)
3. لَمْ — negation particle (verse 3, second occurrence)
4. وَ — conjunction (verse 4)
5. لَمْ — negation particle (verse 4)

Note: The preposition لِ in لَّهُۥ is also a particle — so depending on how you count, there are 5-6 particles.

**Approximate total: 6 nouns, 4 verbs, 5 particles = 15 words**

The surah has a roughly balanced mix of all three types, with nouns slightly leading — fitting for a surah that is fundamentally about identifying WHO Allah is.

<ExerciseBox question="Which words in Al-Ikhlas have tanween? List them and explain what tanween tells you about each word.">

**Answer:**

Two words have tanween:

1. **أَحَدٌ** (aḥadun) — appears in verse 1 and verse 4
   - Tanween: damma tanween (ـٌ)
   - What it tells you: The word is **indefinite** — it does not have ال. It is also in the **nominative case** (tanween damma = indefinite nominative).

2. **كُفُوًا** (kufuwan) — appears in verse 4
   - Tanween: fatha tanween (ـً)
   - What it tells you: The word is **indefinite** — no ال. It is in the **accusative case** (tanween fatha = indefinite accusative).

**Key takeaway:** Tanween is a double signal. It tells you two things at once:
- The word is **indefinite** (no ال)
- The specific tanween type reveals the **case ending** (ـٌ = nominative, ـً = accusative, ـٍ = genitive)

Notice that all the definite words in the surah (ٱللَّهُ, ٱلصَّمَدُ) do NOT have tanween — they have single vowel endings instead. This is exactly the pattern from [L1.06](/learn/level-1/06-definite-article/).

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Find all instances of ٱللَّهُ in the surah. What ending does it have each time? What does that ending tell you?">

**Answer:**

**ٱللَّهُ** appears **twice** in Surah Al-Ikhlas:
1. Verse 1: قُلْ هُوَ **ٱللَّهُ** أَحَدٌ
2. Verse 2: **ٱللَّهُ** ٱلصَّمَدُ

**Both times, it ends with damma (ـُ).**

What this tells you:
- The damma ending (ـُ) is the **nominative case** marker, which you learned in [L1.10](/learn/level-1/10-case-endings/).
- Notice it is a **single** damma, not tanween (ـٌ). That is because ٱللَّهُ is a **definite** proper noun — and definite nouns take single vowel endings, not tanween.
- The nominative case typically marks the **subject** of a sentence — the one doing or being something. In both verses, Allah is the subject: "He is **Allah**" and "**Allah** [is] the Eternal Refuge."

**Pattern:** Definite noun + single damma = definite nominative. Indefinite noun + tanween damma (ـٌ) = indefinite nominative. Same case, different definiteness — shown by single vs. double vowel marks.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="What is the root of أَحَدٌ? Can you guess what other Arabic word shares this root? (Hint: think of the number 'one.')">

**Answer:**

The root of **أَحَدٌ** is **و-ح-د** (w-ḥ-d).

This is the same root as **وَاحِد** (wāḥid), which means "one" — the basic number.

Both أَحَدٌ and وَاحِد come from the same three-letter root and relate to the concept of **oneness**, but they carry slightly different shades of meaning:
- **وَاحِد** — "one" (as a number, like "one book")
- **أَحَد** — "one" (as in unique, the only one, no other)

This is the root system from [L1.05](/learn/level-1/05-root-system-preview/) in action. A single root (و-ح-د) generates multiple words that all orbit around the same core meaning of "oneness." The Quran chose أَحَدٌ here rather than وَاحِدٌ to emphasize that Allah is not just "one in number" but absolutely unique — there is nothing else like Him. You will explore this distinction further in Level 5.

**Bonus:** You might also recognize the root in the word **تَوْحِيد** (tawḥīd), meaning "monotheism" or "the oneness of God" — the central concept of this entire surah.

</ExerciseBox>

## Summary

You just analyzed your first complete surah — every word, in every verse.

With nothing more than Level 1 tools, you identified nouns, verbs, and particles. You distinguished definite words from indefinite ones. You read case endings directly from the Arabic text. You recognized gender and number. You even traced a root across related words.

Fifteen words. Four verses. One surah. And you understood the grammar of all of it.

This is what Level 1 has given you. Carry this confidence into Level 2, where you will start building on this foundation with sentence structure, verb forms, and deeper grammatical relationships. The words will be the same — but your understanding will go further.
