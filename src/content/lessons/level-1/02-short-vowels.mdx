## Introduction

In Surah Al-Ikhlas, one of the shortest and most powerful surahs in the Quran, small marks above and below the letters completely change how each word is pronounced:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="qul huwa llāhu aḥadun"
  translation="Say: He is Allah, the One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
/>

Notice the small marks: the tiny "u" shape above letters (ُ), the small diagonal dash above (َ), and the small diagonal dash below (ِ). These are vowel marks that tell you HOW to pronounce each consonant. Without them, you wouldn't know whether to say "qa" or "qu" or "qi."

**In this lesson, you will:**
- Identify and pronounce the three short vowels: fatha, kasra, damma
- Understand how vowels affect consonant pronunciation
- Read simple voweled words from the Quran

**Connection:** In [Lesson 1.01: Arabic Alphabet & Letter Forms](/learn/level-1/01-alphabet-letter-forms), you learned the 28 consonant letters. Now let's add the sounds that bring them to life.

## Understanding Short Vowels

Arabic consonants without vowels are like English consonants without vowels. The letters "BK" could be "book," "bike," or "bake" — you need vowels to know which word it is. Arabic uses small marks ABOVE or BELOW consonant letters to show which vowel sound to use.

Think of vowel marks as pronunciation instructions written right on the letter. In English, we write "cat" with the vowel "a" between the consonants "c" and "t." In Arabic, you write the consonant and place a tiny mark on it to show the vowel. This makes Arabic more compact and elegant.

In Arabic grammar, these vowel marks are called [short vowels](/resources/glossary#harakat) (ḥarakāt / حَرَكَاتٌ). There are three short vowels in Arabic, each making a different sound:

1. [Short vowel A](/resources/glossary#fatha) (fatḥah / فَتْحَةٌ) **[َ]** — makes the "a" sound like in "cat" or "father"
2. [Short vowel I](/resources/glossary#kasra) (kasrah / كَسْرَةٌ) **[ِ]** — makes the "i" sound like in "sit" or "in"
3. [Short vowel U](/resources/glossary#damma) (ḍammah / ضَمَّةٌ) **[ُ]** — makes the "u" sound like in "put" or "book"

These marks are placed on TOP of a consonant (fatha and damma) or BELOW it (kasra), and they modify how you pronounce that consonant.

## Examples from the Quran

Let's see how short vowels work in real Quranic words. We'll use Surah Al-Ikhlas, which has simple, repetitive vowel patterns perfect for learning.

**Example 1: All three vowels on the same letter**

The letter ba (ب) can take all three short vowels:

<ArabicExample
  arabic="قُلْ"
  transliteration="qul"
  translation="Say"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="قُ"
/>

Here, the letter qaf (ق) has a damma (ُ) on top, making it "qu" like in "book." If it had fatha, it would be "qa." If it had kasra, it would be "qi."

**Example 2: Fatha on multiple letters**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="أَحَدٌ"
  transliteration="aḥadun"
  translation="One"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="أَحَدٌ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **أَ** (a) — Hamza with fatha = "a"
- **حَ** (ḥa) — Ha with fatha = "ḥa"
- **دٌ** (dun) — Dal with tanween damma = "dun"

Notice how each fatha creates an "a" sound after the consonant.

**Example 3: Kasra in action**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
  transliteration="ar-raḥīmi"
  translation="the Most Merciful"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="ٱلرَّحِيمِ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **حِ** (ḥi) — Ha with kasra = "ḥi"
- **ي** (y) — Ya as long vowel carrier
- **مِ** (mi) — Mim with kasra = "mi"

The kasra mark (ِ) below the letter creates the "i" sound, like in "city."

**Example 4: Damma throughout a word**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="هُوَ"
  transliteration="huwa"
  translation="He"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:1"
  highlight="هُ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **هُ** (hu) — Ha with damma = "hu"
- **وَ** (wa) — Waw with fatha = "wa"

The damma (ُ) on the ha creates the "hu" sound like "who."

**Example 5: Mixed vowels in one word**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ٱلصَّمَدُ"
  transliteration="aṣ-ṣamadu"
  translation="the Eternal, the Absolute"
  reference="Al-Ikhlas 112:2"
  highlight="صَمَدُ"
/>

**Breakdown:**
- **صَ** (ṣa) — Sad with fatha = "ṣa"
- **مَ** (ma) — Mim with fatha = "ma"
- **دُ** (du) — Dal with damma = "du"

This word uses both fatha and damma, showing how vowels change throughout a word based on grammar and meaning.

## The Rule

<Callout type="rule" title="The Three Short Vowels">

Every Arabic consonant in the Quran carries a vowel mark (or sukun for no vowel, which you'll learn in the next lesson). The three short vowels are:

1. **Fatha (َ)** = "a" sound (placed above the letter)
2. **Kasra (ِ)** = "i" sound (placed below the letter)
3. **Damma (ُ)** = "u" sound (placed above the letter)

These marks are NOT optional in Quranic text — they are essential for correct pronunciation and understanding. The same consonant with different vowels can be different words with completely different meanings.

</Callout>

<Callout type="warning" title="Common Mistakes">

**Don't ignore the vowel marks and guess the pronunciation.** This is the most common beginner mistake. Arabic has many words that look identical except for the vowel marks. For example:

- كَتَبَ (kataba) = "he wrote"
- كُتِبَ (kutiba) = "it was written"
- كُتُبٌ (kutubun) = "books"

Same three letters (k-t-b), completely different words based only on the vowel marks. Always pay attention to every mark.

**Don't confuse kasra (ِ) below the letter with the letter ya (ي).** Kasra is a small diagonal mark UNDER the letter. Ya is a full letter with two dots beneath it. They create similar sounds but are completely different.

</Callout>

## Practice

<ExerciseBox question="What vowel mark appears on the letter qaf (ق) in the word قُلْ (qul), and what sound does it make?">

**Answer:** Damma (ُ) — makes the "u" sound

**Explanation:** The small "u" shape above the qaf is called damma (ضَمَّة). It creates the "u" sound, like the "u" in "put" or "book."

So the letter ق (qaf) with a damma becomes قُ (qu). The complete word قُلْ is pronounced "qul" meaning "say" — it's a command used throughout the Quran.

If the qaf had a fatha instead (قَ), it would be "qa." If it had a kasra (قِ), it would be "qi." The vowel mark completely changes the pronunciation.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="In the word أَحَدٌ (aḥadun), identify each short vowel and the sound it creates.">

**Answer:**

- **أَ** — Hamza with fatha (َ) = "a" sound → "a"
- **حَ** — Ha with fatha (َ) = "a" sound → "ḥa"
- **دٌ** — Dal with tanween damma (ٌ) = "un" sound → "dun"

**Explanation:** This word has two fatha marks and one tanween damma (double damma, which you'll learn more about later).

The first vowel (أَ) is fatha on hamza, giving us "a."
The second vowel (حَ) is fatha on ha, giving us "ḥa."
The third vowel (دٌ) is tanween on dal, giving us "dun."

Together: a-ḥa-dun = "aḥadun" = "One" (describing Allah's oneness).

Notice how fatha appears twice, showing that the same vowel mark can repeat throughout a word.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Why is the word هُوَ (huwa) pronounced 'who-wah' and not 'ha-wa'?">

**Answer:** Because of the damma (ُ) on the ha

**Explanation:** The letter ha (ه) by itself has no inherent vowel. The vowel mark TELLS you how to pronounce it.

- Without damma: هَوَ would be "hawa"
- With damma: هُوَ is "huwa"

The damma (ُ) is the small "u" shape on top of the ha, creating the "hu" sound like "who" in English.

This word هُوَ (huwa) means "he" and is used constantly in the Quran to refer to Allah. The specific pronunciation comes entirely from the damma mark.

</ExerciseBox>

<ExerciseBox question="Read this word and identify each vowel: ٱلصَّمَدُ">

**Answer:** aṣ-ṣamadu

**Vowel breakdown:**
- **ٱ** — Alif wasla (silent in connected speech)
- **لْ** — Lam with sukun (no vowel) = "l"
- **صَّ** — Sad with shadda and fatha (َ) = "ṣṣa" (doubled)
- **مَ** — Mim with fatha (َ) = "ma"
- **دُ** — Dal with damma (ُ) = "du"

**Complete pronunciation:** aṣ-ṣama-du

**Explanation:** This word from Surah Al-Ikhlas means "the Eternal, the Absolute." It has two fatha marks (on the sad and mim) and one damma (on the dal).

The shadda (ّ) on the sad doubles the consonant but doesn't change the vowel — it still has fatha, making it "ṣṣa" with emphasis.

The final damma on dal (دُ) makes it "du," giving us the complete word aṣ-ṣamadu.
