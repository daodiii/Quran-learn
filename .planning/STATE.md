## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Minimal gamification approach (clean educational focus)
- All Coursera UX features included (progress, design, navigation)
- Preserve existing content (UI/UX layer only)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Phase 5 consideration:** May need to research lesson hierarchy structure in existing 61 MDX files for breadcrumb generation. Research suggests running `/gsd:research-phase 5` if frontmatter lacks explicit parent/category fields.

**Phase 6 consideration:** Determine if progress tracking should sync to Supabase or remain localStorage-only during planning.

**Phase 7 consideration:** Must test on actual iOS devices (iPhone, iPad) for Arabic font rendering validation. Simulator testing insufficient.

**Phase 8 consideration:** Test with both NVDA and VoiceOver screen readers for comprehensive accessibility audit.
