## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

Recent decisions affecting v1.1 work:
- Plain English + analogies — grammar content must be easy to understand
- Bilingual terminology — always show both English and Arabic terms
- Example-heavy pedagogy — show patterns before stating abstract rules
- One concept per lesson — avoid cognitive overload with 73 focused lessons

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Carried from v1.0 (deferred to future milestones):**
- iOS device testing skipped — recommended before production
- auth.ts, progress.ts, capacitor-init.ts stubs need real implementation
- Supabase progress sync deferred (localStorage-only for now)

**New for v1.1:**
- Expert validation workflow needs establishment (Arabic linguist + Muslim educator required for content QA)
- Quranic text API availability needs verification (Quran.com or Tanzil.net)
