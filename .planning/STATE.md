None.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Pre-production (carry forward to next milestone):**
- iOS device testing skipped — recommended before production
- Lighthouse scores validated on production build (99-100 performance, 100 accessibility)
- Lesson content pending (73 MDX files need actual Arabic grammar content)
- auth.ts, progress.ts, capacitor-init.ts stubs need real implementation
