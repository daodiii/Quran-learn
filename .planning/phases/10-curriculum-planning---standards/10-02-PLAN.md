<objective>
Create the bilingual terminology standards and lesson style guide that ensure consistency across all 73 lessons.

Purpose: Without standardized terminology, the same concept will be described differently in different lessons (e.g., "subject" vs "mubtada" without English translation), confusing learners. Without a style guide, lesson authors will use inconsistent formatting, transliteration, and structure. These two documents are the "constitution" for all content authoring in Phases 12-16.

Output: `docs/TERMINOLOGY.md` and `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` — reference documents that validation scripts (Plan 03) will enforce programmatically.

   Example: "Nominative case (raf' / رَفْع)"
2. **Subsequent Mentions:** Use English only OR "English (Arabic)" shorthand — never Arabic-only without English context
3. **Glossary Links:** On first mention, link to glossary: `[Nominative case](/resources/glossary#raf) (raf' / رَفْع)`
4. **Consistency:** Always use the EXACT English and Arabic terms from this document — never synonyms

  </action>
  <verify>
1. Confirm docs/TERMINOLOGY.md exists
2. Count table rows — should have 60+ terminology entries total
3. Verify Arabic text has diacritics (search for combining characters \u064B-\u065F)
4. Verify each entry has all 5 columns: English, Arabic, Transliteration, Definition, First Used
5. Verify "First Used" values reference valid lesson IDs (L1-L5 range)
  </verify>
  <done>
TERMINOLOGY.md provides canonical bilingual terms for all Arabic grammar concepts with 60+ entries across nahw, sarf, and diacritics categories. Each term has English, Arabic (with tashkeel), transliteration, definition, and first-used lesson reference. Usage rules are documented for first-mention format and glossary linking.

  <name>Task 2: Create STYLE_GUIDE.md with lesson template and transliteration scheme</name>
  <files>docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md</files>
  <action>
Create `docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md` with these sections:

**Header:**
- Title: "Style Guide: Quranic Arabic Grammar Lessons"
- Purpose paragraph explaining this document as the formatting standard for all 73 lessons

**1. Lesson Template Structure** (per LSSN-06):
Document the 5-part structure every lesson must follow:

```
1. Introduction (1-2 paragraphs)
   - Hook: Real Quranic example showing the concept in action
   - Learning objectives: 2-3 bullet points
   - Connection to previous lesson (per PDGY-06)

2. Concept Explanation (2-3 paragraphs)
   - Plain English explanation first (per PDGY-01)
   - English analogy (per PDGY-02): "Think of X like English Y"
   - Introduce Arabic terminology last (per PDGY-03), using bilingual format from TERMINOLOGY.md
   - One major concept only (per PDGY-08)

3. Examples Section (3-5 examples)
   - Use <ArabicExample> component for Quranic verses
   - Show pattern before stating rule (per PDGY-04)
   - Include word-by-word breakdown for key examples (per PDGY-07)
   - All Arabic text fully vocalized with tashkeel (per LSSN-07)

4. Grammar Rule (Callout component, type="rule")
   - Concise statement of the grammar rule
   - Reference related lessons (per PDGY-06)
   - Common mistakes section (per PDGY-05)

5. Practice Exercises (3-4 exercises per LSSN-10)
   - Use <ExerciseBox> component
   - Progressive difficulty within the set
   - Answer explanations, not just answers
   - Include i'rab analysis for key exercises (per LSSN-09)
```

Provide a FULL MDX template example showing how a lesson file should look with imports, frontmatter, and all 5 sections using the actual component names (ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox, VerbConjugation).

**2. Transliteration Scheme** (simplified ALA-LC per research):

**Consonant table:**
| Letter | Name | Transliteration |
Full mapping for all 28 letters plus hamza. Key non-obvious mappings:
- ء = ' (hamza)
- ع = ' (ayn) — distinguish from hamza by using ʾ for hamza and ʿ for ayn
- ح = h with underdot (ḥ)
- خ = kh
- ص = s with underdot (ṣ)
- ض = d with underdot (ḍ)
- ط = t with underdot (ṭ)
- ظ = z with underdot (ẓ)
- غ = gh
- ث = th
- ذ = dh
- ش = sh

**Vowel table:**
| Haraka | Short | Long | Example |
- Fatha = a / ā
- Kasra = i / ī
- Damma = u / ū

**Special marks:**
- Sukun: omit (no transliteration)
- Shadda: double the consonant (e.g., محمّد = Muhammad)
- Tanween: -an, -in, -un
- Al- prefix: always "al-" (lowercase, hyphenated), even before sun letters in transliteration

**3. Graduated Transliteration Rules** (per LSSN-11):
| Level | Rule | Example |
| 1-2 | Full transliteration for ALL Arabic text | "al-ḥamdu li-llāhi rabbi al-ʿālamīn" |
| 3 | Transliterate only NEW or difficult words; familiar terms Arabic-only | Mark new words with transliteration, skip bismillah etc. |
| 4-5 | Transliterate only technical grammar terms | Show Arabic text without transliteration except terms like "raf'" |

Define "familiar" as: any word that appeared in Level 1-2 lessons.

**4. Verse Reference Format:**
Standard format: `[Surah Name Chapter:Verse]`
- Always include surah name AND chapter number
- Use colon separator for chapter:verse
- For ranges: `[Al-Baqarah 2:255-256]`
- Surah names use standard English transliteration (Al-Fatiha, Al-Baqarah, etc.)
- Provide a list of all 114 surah names in standard transliteration format

Do NOT include the full 114-surah list in the style guide (that belongs in data files). Instead, reference 10-15 commonly used surahs as examples and state "See data/quran/surah-names.json for complete list."

**5. Arabic Text Formatting:**
- Letter spacing: `letter-spacing: 0` (CRITICAL — prevents disconnection)
- Font: Handled by CSS (Amiri family for grammar text, UthmanicHafs for Quranic text)
- Line height: 1.8 minimum for diacritics clearance
- Direction: All Arabic segments wrapped in RTL context
- Diacritics: EVERY Arabic letter must have a diacritical mark (per LSSN-07)

**6. MDX Component Usage Reference:**
Brief reference for each component with when to use it:
- `<ArabicExample>` — Quranic verse with translation and highlighting
- `<GrammarTable>` — Paradigm tables (case endings, conjugations)
- `<VerbConjugation>` — Verb form display with root/form metadata
- `<Callout type="rule|tip|note|warning">` — Highlighted info boxes
- `<ExerciseBox>` — Practice exercises with answer toggle

**7. Cross-Reference Format** (per PDGY-06):
Standard format for linking between lessons:
- Inline: "As we learned in [Lesson Title](/learn/level-N/slug)"
- See also: Use a "Related Lessons" section at end with bullet list
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Confirm docs/STYLE_GUIDE.md exists
2. Verify all 5 lesson template sections are documented
3. Verify transliteration table covers all 28 Arabic letters
4. Verify graduated transliteration rules for all 5 levels
5. Verify verse reference format is documented with examples
6. Verify MDX component usage reference lists all 5 components (ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox)
  </verify>
  <done>
STYLE_GUIDE.md documents the complete lesson template structure (5 sections), simplified ALA-LC transliteration scheme with full consonant/vowel tables, graduated transliteration rules per level, verse reference format, Arabic text formatting rules, MDX component usage reference, and cross-reference conventions.
