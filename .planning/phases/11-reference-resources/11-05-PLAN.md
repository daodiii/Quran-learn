  <name>Task 1: Create root system guide with trilateral roots, derivation patterns, and dictionary strategy</name>
  <files>src/content/resources/root-system.mdx</files>
  <action>
Replace root-system.mdx placeholder content with comprehensive root system explanation following these specifications:

**Structure:**
1. Keep existing frontmatter (title, order: 5, description)
2. Add MDX component imports (ArabicExample, Callout, GrammarTable)
3. Create introduction explaining root-and-pattern system (Plain English first)
4. Section 1: What Are Roots?
5. Section 2: Trilateral Roots (Three Letters)
6. Section 3: Quadrilateral Roots (Four Letters)
7. Section 4: Derivation Patterns
8. Section 5: How to Look Up a Word (CRITICAL - dictionary strategy)
9. Section 6: Common Quranic Root Families

**Introduction Section:**
Explain the root-and-pattern system in Plain English with an analogy:

"Arabic builds vocabulary like LEGO blocks. Instead of memorizing thousands of unrelated words, you learn a few hundred roots (the core meaning) and a handful of patterns (the grammatical function). Combine them, and you can understand and create thousands of words.

For example, the English words 'write', 'writer', 'written', 'writing', 'rewrite', 'unwritten' all share a common core meaning. Arabic makes this systematic: from the root ك ت ب (meaning 'writing'), you get كَتَبَ (he wrote), كَاتِب (writer), مَكْتُوب (written), كِتَاب (book), مَكْتَب (office/desk), and more.

This root system is the KEY to expanding your Quranic vocabulary efficiently."

**Section 1: What Are Roots?**

Define roots (جُذُور) as the core consonants carrying fundamental meaning:
- Usually 3 consonants (trilateral / ثُلَاثِي)
- Sometimes 4 consonants (quadrilateral / رُبَاعِي)
- Vowels and extra letters create patterns that modify the meaning

**Critical concept:** Roots are consonants only. Vowels change to create different grammatical forms.

Example: Root ك ت ب (k-t-b) relates to writing/recording
- كَتَبَ = he wrote
- يَكْتُبُ = he writes
- كِتَاب = book
- مَكْتَب = office
- كَاتِب = writer

**Section 2: Trilateral Roots (الجُذُور الثُّلَاثِيَّة)**

Explain that ~90% of Arabic roots have three consonants.

**Root Pattern:** ف ع ل

Arabic grammarians use ف ع ل (f-ʿ-l) as the template root to describe patterns:
- ف = first root letter (فَاء الفِعْل)
- ع = middle root letter (عَيْن الفِعْل)
- ل = last root letter (لَام الفِعْل)

When you see a pattern like فَاعِل (fāʿil), apply it to any root:
- ك ت ب → كَاتِب (writer)
- ع ل م → عَالِم (knower/scholar)
- ق ر أ → قَارِئ (reader)

**Common Root Families (with Quranic examples):**

### Root: ك ت ب (k-t-b) - Writing

**Derived words:**
- كَتَبَ (kataba) - he wrote [Form I verb]
- كِتَاب (kitāb) - book [فِعَال pattern noun]
- مَكْتُوب (maktūb) - written [passive participle]
- كَاتِب (kātib) - writer [active participle]

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="ذَٰلِكَ الْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ"
  transliteration="dhālika l-kitābu lā rayba fīhi"
  translation="This is the Book about which there is no doubt"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:2"
  highlight="الْكِتَابُ"
/>

الْكِتَاب (the book) comes from root ك ت ب using the فِعَال (book/written work) pattern.

### Root: ع ل م (ʿ-l-m) - Knowledge

[Similar structure with derived words and Quranic example]

### Root: ق ر أ (q-r-ʾ) - Reading/Recitation

[Similar structure]

**Section 3: Quadrilateral Roots (الجُذُور الرُّبَاعِيَّة)**

Explain that some roots have four consonants (less common, ~10%).

Examples:
- د ح ر ج (d-ḥ-r-j) - rolling
- ز ل ز ل (z-l-z-l) - earthquake/shaking
- و س و س (w-s-w-s) - whispering

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ الْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا"
  transliteration="idhā zulzilati l-arḍu zilzālahā"
  translation="When the earth is shaken with its [final] earthquake"
  reference="Az-Zalzalah 99:1"
  highlight="زُلْزِلَتِ,زِلْزَالَهَا"
/>

Both words come from quadrilateral root ز ل ز ل (shaking/quaking).

**Section 4: Derivation Patterns**

Explain how patterns modify root meaning:

<GrammarTable
  caption="Common Derivation Patterns"
  headers={["Pattern", "Function", "Example (ك ت ب)", "Meaning"]}
  rows={[
    ["فَعَلَ", "Basic verb (Form I)", "كَتَبَ", "he wrote"],
    ["فَاعِل", "Active participle (doer)", "كَاتِب", "writer"],
    ["مَفْعُول", "Passive participle", "مَكْتُوب", "written"],
    ["فِعَال / فِعَالَة", "Noun of action/result", "كِتَابَة", "writing (act)"],
    ["مَفْعَل", "Place or instrument", "مَكْتَب", "office/desk"],
    ["فَعَّلَ", "Intensive/causative (Form II)", "كَتَّبَ", "to make write"],
    ["تَفَعَّلَ", "Reflexive (Form V)", "تَكَتَّبَ", "to be written down"]
  ]}
/>

**Note:** Verb Forms I-X are the most systematic patterns. See [Verb Conjugation Tables](/resources/verb-conjugation-tables) for full details.

**Section 5: How to Look Up a Quranic Word** (CRITICAL SECTION per RSRC-05)

This section must teach the practical skill of using an Arabic dictionary.

**Why this matters:** Arabic dictionaries organize by root, not alphabetically by word. You must extract the root first.

### Step-by-Step Lookup Strategy

**Example:** You encounter the word مُسْلِمُونَ (muslimūn) in the Quran and want to look it up.

**Step 1: Identify the root letters**

Strip away:
- Prefixes: مُـ (participle marker)
- Suffixes: ـُونَ (masculine plural nominative)
- Pattern vowels: Internal vowels are part of the pattern, not the root

What's left: س ل م

**Step 2: Verify you have the root**

Root letters are:
- Usually 3 consonants (sometimes 4)
- Carry the core meaning
- Appear in ALL related words

Test: Does س ل م appear in related words?
- أَسْلَمَ (aslama) - he submitted ✓
- سَلَام (salām) - peace ✓
- إِسْلَام (islām) - submission/Islam ✓

Confirmed: Root is س ل م

**Step 3: Alphabetize the root**

Arabic alphabet order: أ ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي

س (sīn) comes after ز and before ش
ل (lām) comes after ك and before م
م (mīm) comes after ل and before ن

**Step 4: Look up the root in dictionary**

Open dictionary to س section, then ل subsection, then م entry.

Find: **س ل م** (s-l-m) - root meaning: safety, peace, submission

**Step 5: Scan derived words under the root entry**

Dictionary lists patterns derived from س ل م:
- Form I: سَلِمَ (salima) - to be safe
- Form IV: أَسْلَمَ (aslama) - to submit
- Form V: تَسَلَّمَ (tasallama) - to receive
- Nouns: سَلَام (peace), إِسْلَام (Islam), مُسْلِم (Muslim)

**Step 6: Identify your word's pattern**

Your word: مُسْلِمُونَ
- Pattern: مُفْعِل (Form IV active participle) + plural suffix
- Base form: مُسْلِم (muslim) - "one who submits"
- Meaning: Muslims (plural)

<Callout type="tip">
Once you know ~200 common roots and ~10 major patterns, you can decode thousands of Quranic words using this method.
</Callout>

### Common Pitfalls in Root Extraction

**Pitfall 1: Confusing pattern letters with root letters**

❌ Mistake: Thinking root of اِسْتَغْفَرَ is س ت غ ف ر (5 letters)
✓ Correct: Root is غ ف ر (3 letters), اِسْتَـ is Form X prefix, ت is infixed

**Pitfall 2: Not stripping suffixes**

❌ Mistake: Including ـُونَ as part of the root
✓ Correct: ـُونَ is just plural masculine nominative ending

**Pitfall 3: Keeping weak letters (و، ي، أ) that are part of patterns**

❌ Mistake: Thinking root of قَائِم is ق ا ئ م
✓ Correct: Root is ق و م, the ا and ء are pattern modifications

- [200 Most Common Words](/resources/200-most-used-words) - Learn frequent roots
- [Verb Conjugation Tables](/resources/verb-conjugation-tables) - Pattern reference

**Section 6: Common Quranic Root Families**

Create a list of 10-15 highly frequent Quranic roots with derived words:

### ع ب د (ʿ-b-d) - Worship/Servitude

**Derived words:**
- عَبَدَ (ʿabada) - to worship
- عَبْد (ʿabd) - servant/slave
- عِبَادَة (ʿibādah) - worship/act of worship
- عَابِد (ʿābid) - worshipper

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="يَا أَيُّهَا النَّاسُ اعْبُدُوا رَبَّكُمُ"
  transliteration="yā ayyuhā n-nāsu ʿbudū rabbakum"
  translation="O mankind, worship your Lord"
  reference="Al-Baqarah 2:21"
  highlight="اعْبُدُوا"
/>

[Repeat similar structure for 10-15 roots total, prioritizing Quranic frequency]

Suggested roots to include:
- ك ف ر (disbelief)
- ء م ن (belief/safety)
- ن ز ل (descending/revelation)
- ق و ل (saying/speech)
- ف ع ل (doing/action)
- ص ل ح (righteousness/reform)
- ح م د (praise)

**Critical Requirements:**
- ALL Arabic text must have full tashkeel
- Dictionary lookup section MUST be included (RSRC-05 requirement)
- Use step-by-step numbered workflow for dictionary strategy
- Include common pitfalls section to prevent mistakes
- Provide at least 10 Quranic root families with examples
- Cross-reference to L3.01 (Root System lesson) and other resources
- Use concrete examples (مُسْلِمُونَ extraction walkthrough) not just theory

**Progressive Disclosure:**
Add collapsible sections for:
- Augmented roots (roots with additional letters like hamza or doubled letters)
- How to handle weak roots (roots with و، ي، or أ)
- Specialized vocabulary (medical, scientific terms based on classical roots)
