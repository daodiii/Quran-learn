Purpose: Provide persistent reference material that lessons can link to for terminology lookup, supporting learner autonomy and vocabulary building across all 73 lessons.

Output: Complete glossary.mdx file with alphabetized entries following bilingual entry format from RESEARCH.md.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Create glossary with 100-150 alphabetized bilingual grammar terms</name>
  <files>src/content/resources/glossary.mdx</files>
  <action>
Replace glossary.mdx placeholder content with comprehensive bilingual glossary following these specifications:

**Structure:**
1. Keep existing frontmatter (title, order: 3, description)
2. Add MDX component imports (ArabicExample, Callout)
3. Create introduction explaining how to use the glossary
4. Organize entries by Arabic alphabet sections: أ (Alif), ب (Ba), ت (Ta), etc.

**Term Selection:**
- Include ALL terms from TERMINOLOGY.md (~120 terms across nahw/sarf categories)
- Expand to 100-150 terms by adding:
  - Level 4-5 advanced terms (mark with "(Advanced)" tag)
  - Common rhetorical terms (balāghah)
  - Additional derived noun types
  - Specialized verb terminology

**Entry Format (per RESEARCH.md bilingual pattern):**
```markdown
### English Term

**Arabic:** عَرَبِي (transliteration)

**Definition:** Plain English explanation of the grammatical concept (1-2 sentences).

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="[fully vocalized Quranic text]"
  transliteration="[simplified ALA-LC]"
  translation="[English meaning]"
  reference="[Surah Name Chapter:Verse]"
  highlight="[word demonstrating concept]"
/>

[1-2 sentences explaining how the highlighted word demonstrates the concept]

**Case markers / Pattern notes / Usage notes:** [relevant technical details]

- [Related Resource Section](/resources/resource-name#anchor)
- [Glossary: Related Term](/resources/glossary#anchor)

<Callout type="note|tip|rule">
[Optional: common mistake alert, mnemonic, or important clarification]
</Callout>
```

**Critical Requirements:**
- ALL Arabic text must have full tashkeel (diacritics on every letter)
- Use EXACT English and Arabic terms from TERMINOLOGY.md (no synonyms)
- letter-spacing: 0 for all Arabic (no CSS needed, just verify in content)
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format: "English (transliteration / عَرَبِي)"
- Alphabetize by Arabic alphabet: أ ب ت ث ج ح خ د ذ ر ز س ش ص ض ط ظ ع غ ف ق ك ل م ن ه و ي
- 2-4 cross-reference links per entry (primary lesson, prerequisite, related resource)

**Example Entry (following RESEARCH.md template):**
```markdown
## أ (Alif)

### Accusative Case

**Arabic:** نَصْب (naṣb)

**Definition:** The grammatical case used for direct objects, circumstantial expressions (ḥāl), and predicates of inna and her sisters. Marked by fatha (ـَ) on singular nouns.

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ الْكَوْثَرَ"
  transliteration="innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthara"
  translation="Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar"
  reference="Al-Kawthar 108:1"
  highlight="الْكَوْثَرَ"
/>

The word الْكَوْثَرَ (al-kawthar) is in the accusative case because it's the direct object of the verb أَعْطَيْنَا (we granted).

**Case markers:**
- Singular: ـَ (fatha) — كِتَابًا
- Dual: ـَيْنِ (alif becomes ya) — كِتَابَيْنِ
- Sound masc. plural: ـِينَ (kasra + ya + fatha) — مُسْلِمِينَ
- Sound fem. plural: ـَاتِ (fatha on ta) — مُسْلِمَاتِ

- [L2.10: Inna and Sisters](/learn/level-2/inna-sisters)
- [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart#nasb)

<Callout type="note">
The accusative is the most versatile case, with uses beyond direct objects. See full list in Lesson 2.05.
</Callout>
```

**Prioritize these term categories from TERMINOLOGY.md:**
1. Sentence Types (nominal, verbal, subject, predicate)
2. Case System (nominative, accusative, genitive, iʿrāb, tanwīn)
3. Word Types (noun, verb, particle, definite article)
4. Sentence Components (subject, object, preposition, iḍāfah, adjective)
5. Inna/Kaana families
6. Definiteness (definite, indefinite, proper noun)
7. Advanced Syntax (conditional particles, exception, emphasis)
8. Root & Pattern System (trilateral root, verb forms I-X)
9. Tenses/Moods (past, present, imperative, jussive, subjunctive)
10. Derived Nouns (active/passive participles, verbal noun)
11. Pronouns (independent, attached, demonstrative, relative)
12. Verb Classifications (transitive, intransitive, sound, weak)
13. Diacritics (fatha, kasra, damma, sukun, shadda)

**Quranic Example Selection:**
- Prioritize clarity over familiarity
- Use CURRICULUM_MAP.md "Quranic Focus" column to align with lesson examples
- Aim for 60% Juz 'Amma (familiar short surahs), 40% other surahs
- Ensure every example is from authentic Quranic text (use Tanzil.net data if needed)
  </action>
  <verify>
Run validation scripts to confirm glossary meets standards:
```bash
cd /Users/daodilyas/quran-learn
npm run validate:diacritics src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
npm run validate:terminology src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
npm run validate:verse-refs src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
```

All validation checks must pass (diacritics ratio >0.7, terminology matches TERMINOLOGY.md, verse references valid).

Manual verification:
- Open glossary.mdx and confirm entries are alphabetized by Arabic alphabet
- Count total entries (should be 100-150)
- Spot-check 5 random entries for bilingual format correctness
- Verify at least 3 entries have cross-reference links to lessons
  </verify>
  <done>
Glossary contains 100-150 grammar terms alphabetized by Arabic alphabet, each with bilingual definition, Quranic example, and lesson cross-references. All Arabic text fully vocalized. Validation scripts pass.
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
Run validation suite:
```bash
npm run validate:diacritics src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
npm run validate:terminology src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
npm run validate:verse-refs src/content/resources/glossary.mdx
```

Manual checks:
- Entries follow Arabic alphabetical order (أ → ي)
- Each entry has English term, Arabic term, transliteration, definition, example
- Cross-references link to valid curriculum lessons
- All Callout components use valid types (note, tip, rule, warning)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
**Measurable outcomes:**
1. Glossary file size >40KB (indicates substantial content, not placeholder)
2. Contains 100-150 distinct grammar term entries
3. Every entry follows bilingual format with Arabic script and transliteration
4. Validation scripts report zero errors for diacritics, terminology, verse references
5. At least 80% of entries include cross-reference links to curriculum lessons
6. Alphabetization by Arabic alphabet verified (أ section before ب section, etc.)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/11-reference-resources/11-01-SUMMARY.md` documenting:
- Number of glossary entries created (target: 100-150)
- Term categories covered (nahw vs. sarf breakdown)
- Validation results (diacritics ratio, terminology matches, verse reference validity)
- Cross-reference network statistics (how many lessons linked, how many other resources linked)
- Any terms from TERMINOLOGY.md that were excluded and why
</output>
