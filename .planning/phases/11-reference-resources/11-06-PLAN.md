Replace 200-most-used-words.mdx placeholder content with frequency-based vocabulary list following these specifications:

**Structure:**
1. Keep existing frontmatter (title, order: 1, description)
2. Add MDX component imports (ArabicExample, Callout)
3. Create introduction explaining how to use the list
4. Organize words by part of speech (NOT pure frequency order):
   - Particles (1-40)
   - Common Verbs (41-120)
   - Essential Nouns (121-200)
5. Within each category, order by frequency

# 200 Most Common Quranic Words

This list contains the 200 most frequently used words in the Quran. Mastering these gives you comprehension of approximately 50% of the Quranic text.

**Why these 200 words?**

Language learning research shows that high-frequency vocabulary delivers the greatest comprehension gains with the least effort. The top 100 words in any language typically account for 40-50% of all text. By learning these 200 Quranic words, you'll recognize half the words you encounter while reading.

**How to use this list:**

1. **Particles & Pronouns (1-40):** Focus on recognition — you'll see these in nearly every verse. These are function words that structure sentences but don't carry primary meaning.

2. **Common Verbs (41-120):** Learn meaning + root — these describe actions in Quranic narratives and commands. Understanding these unlocks the dynamic content of verses.

3. **Essential Nouns (121-200):** Core vocabulary — these carry theological and narrative content. These are the key concepts, people, and things discussed in the Quran.

**Study strategy:**
- Review 10 words daily → complete list in 20 days
- Use spaced repetition: review previously learned words every 3-5 days
- When reading Quran, actively identify these words to reinforce recognition
- Link verbs and nouns back to their roots (see [Root System Guide](/resources/root-system))

**Color coding:**
- **Bold** = Top 50 (ultra-high frequency, >500 occurrences)
- Regular = High frequency (100-500 occurrences)
- (Advanced) = Requires L3+ grammar knowledge
```

**Entry Format (per RESEARCH.md template):**

```markdown
### 1. وَ (wa)

**Meaning:** "and", "by" (in oaths)

**Frequency:** 3,900+ occurrences

**Root:** (particle - no root)

**Quranic Example:**

<ArabicExample
  arabic="وَالشَّمْسِ وَضُحَاهَا"
  transliteration="wa-sh-shamsi wa-ḍuḥāhā"
  translation="By the sun and its brightness"
  reference="Ash-Shams 91:1"
  highlight="وَ"
/>

**Usage notes:** Most common word in the Quran. Connects words, phrases, and sentences. In oath formulas (like Surah Ash-Shams), وَ means "by".

**Related:** [Glossary: Particles](/resources/glossary#particles)

---
```

**Data Source:**

Use frequency data from [Quranic Arabic Corpus](https://corpus.quran.com/lemmas.jsp) and [Fluent Arabic frequency list](https://fluentarabic.net/quran-frequency-list/).

For each word, record:
1. **Rank** (1-200 within category)
2. **Arabic word** (fully vocalized)
3. **Transliteration** (simplified ALA-LC)
4. **Meaning** (English)
5. **Frequency** (occurrence count or range)
6. **Root** (for verbs and nouns; "particle - no root" for particles)
7. **Quranic Example** (verse reference showing authentic usage)
8. **Usage notes** (grammatical function, special cases, common contexts)

**Part 1: Particles and Pronouns (1-40)**

Focus on function words that appear constantly but carry structural rather than semantic meaning.

**Include:**
- Conjunctions: وَ (and), فَ (then/so), أَوْ (or)
- Prepositions: فِي (in), مِن (from), إِلَى (to), عَلَى (on), بِ (with/by), لِ (for/to)
- Particles: مَا (what/not), لَا (no/not), إِنَّ (indeed), أَنَّ (that), قَد (already/indeed)
- Pronouns: هُوَ (he), هُم (they), مَن (who), ذَٰلِكَ (that)
- Interrogatives: كَيْفَ (how), أَيْنَ (where), مَتَى (when)

**Example entries:**

1. **وَ** (wa) - "and" - 3,900+ occurrences
2. **فِي** (fī) - "in" - 1,200+ occurrences
3. **مِن** (min) - "from" - 1,100+ occurrences
4. **مَا** (mā) - "what/not" - 900+ occurrences
5. **لَا** (lā) - "no/not" - 700+ occurrences

```

[Continue through rank 200]

**Critical Requirements:**
- ALL Arabic text must have full tashkeel
- Words MUST be grouped by part of speech (particles/pronouns 1-40, verbs 41-120, nouns 121-200)
- Within each category, order by frequency (highest → lowest)
- Include frequency count or range for each word
- Every content word (verbs/nouns) must show root
- Every entry needs at least one Quranic example with verse reference
- Cross-reference to relevant resources (Root System, Verb Tables, Glossary, Lessons)

**Progressive Disclosure:**
Add callout boxes with study tips throughout:

```markdown
<Callout type="tip">
**Milestone Alert:** You've learned the top 50 words! This covers ~35% of all Quranic text. Keep going!
</Callout>
```

```markdown
<Callout type="note">
**Study Tip:** Verbs 41-80 are mostly Form I (basic pattern). If you see an unfamiliar verb, try identifying its root first, then check if it follows the فَعَلَ pattern.
</Callout>
```

**Data Quality Notes:**

- Use lemma frequencies (base forms), not inflected form counts
- When multiple forms exist (أَن، إِن، أَنَّ، إِنَّ), list the most common variant
- For verbs, list past tense 3rd masculine singular as base form
- For nouns, list singular nominative indefinite as base form
- Ensure frequency data comes from authoritative Quranic corpus (not Modern Standard Arabic corpora)

**Example Source Citation:**
In introduction, add note:
"Frequency data compiled from the Quranic Arabic Corpus (corpus.quran.com) and cross-referenced with traditional Arabic grammar frequency studies."
