<objective>
Create L4.10 Negation Particles (Adawat al-Nafy) — teaching the complete Arabic negation system with five key particles and their distinct tense/mood requirements.

Purpose: Negation is fundamental to Arabic and the Quran. Surah Al-Kafirun uses multiple negation forms, making it the ideal teaching text. The key challenge is that English "not" maps to five different Arabic particles, each with specific grammatical requirements. The lam particle is particularly confusing (present form + past meaning + jussive mood).

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file with comprehensive negation particle table, decision tree, and same-verb comparative examples.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kafirun (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: multiple negation particles) — "لَا أَعْبُدُ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ" [Al-Kafirun 109:2] — "I do not worship what you worship." Then "وَلَا أَنتُمْ عَابِدُونَ مَا أَعْبُدُ" [109:3]. Show the repetitive negation structure.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn various negation particles (la, ma, lam, lan, laysa)
  2. Understand how each affects verb mood or noun case
  3. Identify negation types in Quranic verses
- Connection: "You've learned how particles create conditions (L4.03-04) and emphasis (L4.06). Now learn how particles create NEGATION. Arabic has five main negation particles — each for a specific tense, mood, and sentence type."

**Section 2 — Understanding Negation Particles:**
- Plain English: "English uses 'not' for everything. Arabic has FIVE different words for 'not,' and each one has strict rules about which verb tense and form it takes."
- English analogy: "Think of it like how English has 'don't' (present), 'didn't' (past), and 'won't' (future). Arabic takes this further with MOOD changes too."
- Arabic terminology: [negation](/resources/glossary#nafy) (nafy / نَفْيٌ) — "denial/negation"

**Comprehensive negation table (15-RESEARCH.md pattern):**
GrammarTable with columns: Particle | Meaning | With Tense | Mood/Case Effect | Example

| لَا (lā) | not (present) | Present indicative | No mood change | لَا أَعْبُدُ — "I do not worship" |
| لَمْ (lam) | did not | Present form → jussive | Shortens verb (jazm) | لَمْ يَلِدْ — "He did not beget" |
| مَا (mā) | not (past) | Past tense | No change | مَا كَذَبَ — "He did not lie" |
| لَنْ (lan) | will not | Present → subjunctive | Adds fatha (nasb) | لَنْ أَعْبُدَ — "I will never worship" |
| لَيْسَ (laysa) | is not | Nominal sentence | Predicate → accusative | لَيْسَ كَمِثْلِهِ شَيْءٌ — "Nothing is like Him" |

**Same-verb comparison (critical for understanding — 15-RESEARCH.md Code Examples):**
Show one verb (e.g., يَذْهَبُ / ذَهَبَ from root ذ-ه-ب) with ALL five negation particles:
- Affirmative: يَذْهَبُ (he goes)
- لَا يَذْهَبُ (he does not go — present, no change)
- لَمْ يَذْهَبْ (he did not go — jussive, past meaning)
- لَنْ يَذْهَبَ (he will not go — subjunctive, future)
- مَا ذَهَبَ (he did not go — past tense, no change)
- لَيْسَ ذَاهِبًا (he is not a goer — nominal, predicate accusative)

- Highlight the mood markers: damma (indicative), sukun (jussive), fatha (subjunctive)

**CRITICAL — لَمْ uniqueness (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 5):**
- لَمْ is UNIQUE: present FORM + past MEANING + jussive MOOD
- Why this confuses learners: they see a present-tense-looking verb but must translate it as past
- لَمْ يَلِدْ [Al-Ikhlas 112:3] — looks present but means "He did NOT beget" (past)

**Decision tree for choosing negation particles:**
1. What TENSE do you want to negate?
   - Present → لَا (no mood change) or لَمْ (jussive, but past meaning)
   - Past → مَا (with past tense verb) or لَمْ (with present tense verb, jussive)
   - Future → لَنْ (subjunctive)
2. Is it a nominal sentence? → لَيْسَ
3. Do you need emphasis on non-occurrence? → لَمْ for definitive past negation

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 4-6 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kafirun primarily
- Show multiple negation particles in context
- Full i'rab for at least 3 examples showing mood changes
- Include لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ from Al-Ikhlas
- Show the visible difference between لَا يَذْهَبُ (indicative) and لَمْ يَذْهَبْ (jussive)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Five negation particles for five situations: لَا (present, no change), لَمْ (past meaning, jussive mood), مَا (past tense, no change), لَنْ (future, subjunctive), لَيْسَ (nominal, predicate accusative). The particle determines tense AND mood."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "MOST CONFUSING: لَمْ uses PRESENT form but means PAST. لَمْ يَذْهَبْ = 'he did not go' (not 'he does not go')."
  - "Don't use لَا with past tense — use مَا or لَمْ instead. لَا is only for present tense negation."
  - "Don't forget mood changes: لَمْ → jussive (sukun/shortened), لَنْ → subjunctive (fatha). لَا and مَا cause NO mood change."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Particle selection (beginner): "Choose the correct negation particle for each sentence based on tense and meaning."
  2. Mood verification (beginner): "The verb after لَمْ should be in jussive mood. Fix any errors: لَمْ يَذْهَبُ → ?"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Identify ALL negation particles in Surah Al-Kafirun. For each, state: particle, tense, mood effect."
  4. Translation + particle choice (intermediate): "Translate each English negation into Arabic, choosing the correct particle: 'He does not know,' 'He did not know,' 'He will not know.'"
