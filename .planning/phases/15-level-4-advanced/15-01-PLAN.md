<objective>
Create L4.01 Hal Clauses (Circumstantial Expressions) and L4.02 Tamyiz (Specification) — the first two Level 4 lessons introducing specialized accusative functions beyond direct objects.

Purpose: These lessons extend the accusative case knowledge from L2.05. Hal describes the STATE in which an action occurs; tamyiz CLARIFIES what is meant by an ambiguous expression. Both require accusative case but serve distinct functions. Teaching them together shows learners that the accusative case has multiple specialized roles.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with Quranic examples, hal vs na't distinction table, common mistake alerts, and 3-4 exercises each.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Yusuf (CURRICULUM_MAP designated). Use a narrative verse with a clear hal clause, such as "وَجَاءُوا أَبَاهُمْ عِشَاءً يَبْكُونَ" [Yusuf 12:16] — "And they came to their father at night, weeping" — where يَبْكُونَ is a hal clause describing HOW they came.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand hal as describing the state/circumstance of an action
  2. Recognize accusative case marking on hal expressions
  3. Identify circumstantial clauses in Quranic narrative
- Connection: "In [L2.05](/learn/level-2/accusative-case), you learned the accusative case marks direct objects. Now discover a specialized accusative function: hal — describing the STATE or CONDITION in which an action happens."

**Section 2 — Understanding Hal:**
- Plain English: "Hal answers the question 'In what state?' or 'How?' Think of it like a snapshot describing what was happening AT THE MOMENT of the main action. 'He came RUNNING' — 'running' is the hal."
- English analogy: "English uses participles or prepositional phrases: 'She arrived smiling,' 'He left in anger.' Arabic uses a specific grammatical construction for this."
- Arabic terminology: [circumstantial expression](/resources/glossary#hal) (hal / حَالٌ) — literally "state" or "condition"
- Three hal types:
  1. **Single word hal:** رَاكِبًا (riding), مُبْتَسِمًا (smiling)
  2. **Sentence hal (jumlah haliyyah):** وَهُمْ يَبْكُونَ (while they were weeping)
  3. **Semi-sentence hal:** فِي سَيَّارَتِهِ (in his car)
- Hal rules:
  - Always describes the SUBJECT or OBJECT (the owner of the hal / sahib al-hal)
  - Single-word hal is always INDEFINITE (nakira)
  - Single-word hal is always ACCUSATIVE (mansub)
  - Describes a TEMPORARY state, not a permanent quality

**CRITICAL — Hal vs Na't distinction (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 3):**
- GrammarTable comparing Hal vs Na't with these columns: Property | Na't (Adjective) | Hal (Circumstantial)
  - Definiteness: Matches noun | Always indefinite
  - Case: Matches noun's case | Always accusative
  - Meaning: Inherent quality | Temporary state
  - Question: What kind? | In what condition?
  - Agreement: All 4 properties | Gender and number only
- Two worked examples side by side:
  - Na't: جَاءَ الرَّجُلُ الكَرِيمُ — الكَرِيمُ is definite, nominative (matches noun)
  - Hal: جَاءَ الرَّجُلُ رَاكِبًا — رَاكِبًا is indefinite, accusative (hal)
- Quick test: "Can you make it definite without breaking the meaning? Yes = na't. No = hal."

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Yusuf with morphological i'rab analysis
- Each showing: the hal word/clause, its sahib (owner), and the Function+Case+Reason analysis
- Word-by-word breakdown for at least 2 examples showing root, pattern, form
- Show at least one single-word hal AND one sentence hal (jumlah haliyyah)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Hal (حَالٌ) describes the TEMPORARY STATE of the doer or object during the action. Single-word hal is always: (1) Indefinite, (2) Accusative, (3) Agrees in gender and number with its owner. Sentence hal begins with وَ (waw al-hal)."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05 common mistake alerts):
  - "Don't confuse hal with na't (adjective): Hal is indefinite and accusative regardless of the noun's case. Na't matches all four properties."
  - "Don't forget waw al-hal: Sentence-type hal typically begins with وَ followed by a complete sentence."
  - "Don't make hal definite to match a definite noun — hal MUST be indefinite."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Which word is the hal? جَاءَ الوَلَدُ مُسْرِعًا / رَأَيْتُ الطَّالِبَ جَالِسًا"
  2. Hal vs Na't (beginner): "Is the underlined word hal or na't? Explain how you determined."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Identify the hal in this Surah Yusuf verse. Name the sahib al-hal and explain the circumstance."
  4. Construction (intermediate): "Add an appropriate hal to complete: خَرَجَ المُعَلِّمُ ___" (The teacher went out ___)"

level: 4
order: 2
description: "Understand tamyiz as clarifying ambiguous nouns or numbers, recognize accusative case on tamyiz, and identify specification constructions in the Quran."
draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kahf (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) — e.g., "وَلَبِثُوا فِي كَهْفِهِمْ ثَلَاثَ مِائَةٍ سِنِينَ" [Al-Kahf 18:25] — "three hundred years" — where سِنِينَ specifies what is being counted.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand tamyiz as clarifying ambiguous nouns or numbers
  2. Recognize accusative case on tamyiz
  3. Identify specification constructions in the Quran
- Connection: "In the previous lesson, you learned hal — describing HOW an action occurs. Now learn tamyiz — clarifying WHAT is meant by an ambiguous expression. Both use accusative case but serve different purposes."

**Section 2 — Understanding Tamyiz:**
- Plain English: "Tamyiz removes ambiguity. When someone says 'I have twenty...' twenty WHAT? 'Twenty books' — 'books' is the tamyiz. Or 'The city expanded...' expanded in what way? 'in population' — that's tamyiz of a sentence."
- English analogy: "English uses 'of' or compounds: 'a cup OF tea,' 'an acre OF land.' Arabic uses the accusative case instead."
- Arabic terminology: [specification](/resources/glossary#tamyiz) (tamyīz / تَمْيِيز) — literally "distinguishing" or "clarifying"
- Two types of tamyiz:
  1. **Tamyiz of nouns (mufrad):** Clarifies measurements, numbers, weights
     - عِشْرُونَ كِتَابًا — "twenty books" (كِتَابًا specifies the counted item)
     - رِطْلٌ تَمْرًا — "a pound of dates" (تَمْرًا specifies what is weighed)
  2. **Tamyiz of sentences (jumlah):** Clarifies a vague meaning in a whole sentence
     - طَابَ المَدِينَةُ هَوَاءً — "The city is pleasant in (its) air" (هَوَاءً specifies what aspect)
- Tamyiz rules:
  - Always INDEFINITE (nakira)
  - Always ACCUSATIVE (mansub)
  - Comes AFTER the word it clarifies
  - Cannot be removed without creating ambiguity

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kahf
- Each with morphological i'rab: Function + Case + Reason + Root + Pattern
- Show both numeral tamyiz and sentence tamyiz in Quranic context
- Word-by-word breakdown for at least 2 examples

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Tamyiz (تَمْيِيز) clarifies ambiguous expressions. Two types: (1) Noun tamyiz — after numbers, measurements, weights (accusative singular indefinite), (2) Sentence tamyiz — specifies what aspect of a sentence's meaning (accusative indefinite). Always accusative, always indefinite."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse tamyiz with hal: Tamyiz clarifies WHAT (specification). Hal describes HOW (state). Test: Can you replace with 'in what state?' = hal. 'Of what kind?' = tamyiz."
  - "Don't confuse tamyiz with the mudaf ilayh in idafa: رِطْلُ تَمْرٍ (a pound of dates, genitive = idafa) vs. رِطْلٌ تَمْرًا (a pound, dates — accusative = tamyiz). The tanween on رِطْلٌ signals tamyiz."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Find the tamyiz: عِنْدِي عِشْرُونَ دِرْهَمًا"
  2. Type classification (beginner): "Is this noun tamyiz or sentence tamyiz? Explain."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Identify the tamyiz in this Al-Kahf verse and explain what it clarifies."
  4. Tamyiz vs Hal (intermediate): "Determine whether the accusative word is hal or tamyiz in each sentence. Explain your reasoning."
