<objective>
Create L4.03 Conditional Sentences (Shart & Jawab) and L4.04 Types of Conditional Particles — the conditional logic pair. L4.03 teaches the two-part structure (condition + result) and the concept of mood changes. L4.04 dives into specific particles (in, idha, law, lamma, etc.) with their nuances.

Purpose: Conditional sentences are among the most complex Arabic structures. The certainty scale (law-in-idha) is the most common source of learner confusion (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1). Teaching structure first (L4.03), then particle nuances (L4.04) prevents overwhelm.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with certainty scale pedagogy, mood change demonstrations, and Quranic conditional examples.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "in kuntum sadiqin") — e.g., "إِن كُنتُمْ صَادِقِينَ" [Al-Baqarah 2:23] — "if you are truthful." Show how إِنْ sets up a condition.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand conditional sentence structure (if-clause and result-clause)
  2. Recognize verb mood changes in conditional context
  3. Identify conditional sentences in Quranic commands and warnings
- Connection: "In [L2.03](/learn/level-2/verbal-sentences), you learned verbal sentence structure. Conditional sentences are COMPOUND verbal sentences with an if-then relationship. The 'if' part is the condition (shart), the 'then' part is the result (jawab)."

**Section 2 — Understanding Conditional Sentences:**
- Plain English: "Arabic conditionals work like English if-then statements, but the verb forms CHANGE based on the conditional particle. The key insight: the particle controls the mood of BOTH verbs."
- English analogy: "Compare: 'If he comes, I will help' (present-future in English). Arabic changes BOTH verbs to show they are conditional — like English subjunctive 'If he were to come...'"
- Arabic terminology:
  - [conditional particle](/resources/glossary#adat-ash-shart) (adāt ash-sharṭ / أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ) — the "if" word
  - [condition clause](/resources/glossary#jumlat-ash-shart) (jumlat ash-sharṭ / جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ) — the "if" clause
  - [result clause](/resources/glossary#jawab-ash-shart) (jawāb ash-sharṭ / جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ) — the "then" clause
- Structure diagram:
  ```
  [أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ] + [جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ] + [جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ]
     Particle     +    Condition      +      Result
       إِنْ        +   تَنصُرُوا اللَّهَ  +    يَنصُرْكُمْ
       If          +   you support Allah  +  He will support you
  ```
- Mood change explanation:
  - When إِنْ (jazm particle) is used, BOTH verbs go to jussive mood (majzum)
  - Show the jussive markers: deletion of final nun (تَنصُرُونَ → تَنصُرُوا), sukun on final letter
  - Reference L3.04 for present tense mood knowledge
- GrammarTable showing 3-4 conditional sentences parsed into: Particle | Condition Verb | Result Verb | Mood Change

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah
- Full morphological i'rab for at least 2 examples: Function + Case + Reason + Root + Pattern + Form
- Show إِنْ examples primarily (the most important jazm particle)
- Demonstrate the mood change visible in verb endings

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "A conditional sentence has three parts: (1) Conditional particle (أَدَاةُ الشَّرْطِ), (2) Condition clause (جُمْلَةُ الشَّرْطِ), (3) Result clause (جَوَابُ الشَّرْطِ). When إِنْ is used, both verbs take jussive mood (مَجْزُوم). The result clause may need فَ (fa) before it in certain cases."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't forget mood changes: إِنْ requires jussive (shortened forms) in BOTH clauses, not just the condition."
  - "Don't confuse إِنْ (conditional 'if') with إِنَّ (emphatic 'indeed') — the shadda makes all the difference."
  - "Watch for فَ before the result clause: when the result is a nominal sentence, imperative, or starts with certain particles, فَ is required."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Structure identification (beginner): "In this Quranic verse, identify: (a) the conditional particle, (b) the condition clause, (c) the result clause."
  2. Mood analysis (beginner): "What mood are the verbs in? Explain why based on the conditional particle."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Parse the conditional sentence in this Al-Baqarah verse with full i'rab."
  4. Construction (intermediate): "Complete the conditional sentence: إِنْ تَدْرُسُوا ___ (If you study, ___). Use jussive mood for both verbs."

title: "Types of Conditional Particles"
level: 4
order: 4
description: "Distinguish between conditional particles (in, idha, law, lamma) based on certainty level and understand their different mood requirements."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Yusuf (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) showing multiple conditional particles — demonstrate how different particles change meaning.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Distinguish between in, law, idha, lamma, and other conditional particles
  2. Understand nuances: definite vs. uncertain conditions
  3. Analyze complex conditional structures in the Quran
- Connection: "In [L4.03](/learn/level-4/conditional-sentences), you learned the conditional sentence structure. Now learn how different particles change the CERTAINTY and MOOD of the condition."

**Section 2 — Understanding Conditional Particles:**
- Plain English: "Not all 'ifs' are equal. In English, 'if it rains' is uncertain, 'when it rains' is expected, 'if only it rained' is impossible. Arabic has separate particles for each certainty level."

**CRITICAL — Certainty Scale (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1, most common learner error):**
- Present the CERTAINTY SCALE visually:
  ```
  IMPOSSIBLE ←——— UNCERTAIN ———→ EXPECTED
     لَوْ           إِنْ            إِذَا
    "if only"       "if"         "when/if"
  ```
- Detailed particle breakdown with GrammarTable:

| Particle | Meaning | Certainty | Mood Effect | Verb Tense | Example |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|---------|
| إِنْ (in) | if | Uncertain/hypothetical | Jussive (jazm) both verbs | Present | إِن تَنصُرُوا... |
| إِذَا (idha) | when/if | Expected/likely | NO mood change (indicative) | Past (but future meaning) | إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ اللَّهِ |
| لَوْ (law) | if only/had | Impossible/counterfactual | NO mood change | Past tense | لَوْ كَانُوا يَعْلَمُونَ |
| لَمَّا (lamma) | when (past) | Completed event | NO mood change | Past tense | لَمَّا جَاءَهُمْ |
| مَنْ (man) | whoever | General person | Jussive (jazm) | Present | مَنْ يَعْمَلْ خَيْرًا |
| مَا (ma) | whatever | General thing | Jussive (jazm) | Present | مَا تَفْعَلُوا مِنْ خَيْرٍ |

- Key teaching point: إِذَا is originally "when" (temporal), NOT "if" — this prevents the most common error
- لَوْ with past tense for impossible/counterfactual conditions
- إِنْ as the default "uncertain if" with jussive mood

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 4-6 ArabicExample from Surah Yusuf showing DIFFERENT particles
- At least one example each for إِنْ, إِذَا, لَوْ
- Show how particle choice reveals the speaker's certainty about the condition
- i'rab analysis showing mood differences between particles

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Choose conditional particles by certainty: إِذَا for expected events ('when'), إِنْ for uncertain conditions ('if'), لَوْ for impossible/counterfactual ('if only'). Only إِنْ and مَنْ/مَا trigger jussive mood. إِذَا and لَوْ do NOT change verb mood."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "MOST COMMON ERROR: Using إِنْ and إِذَا interchangeably. Remember: إِذَا = 'when' (expected). إِنْ = 'if' (uncertain). The Quran uses إِذَا جَاءَ (when comes) because the event IS expected."
  - "Don't use jussive mood after إِذَا — only إِنْ triggers jazm."
  - "لَوْ always uses past tense — even for present hypotheticals. 'If I were rich' = لَوْ كُنْتُ غَنِيًّا (past tense)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Particle selection (beginner): "Choose the correct particle: ___ جَاءَ المَطَرُ (when the rain comes — expected event). Options: إِنْ / إِذَا / لَوْ"
  2. Certainty analysis (beginner): "Place each Quranic conditional on the certainty scale. Explain your reasoning."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Compare these two Surah Yusuf verses using different conditional particles. What does the particle choice tell us about the speaker's certainty?"
  4. Mood verification (intermediate): "For each conditional sentence, identify the particle and verify: does the verb show jussive mood? Should it?"
