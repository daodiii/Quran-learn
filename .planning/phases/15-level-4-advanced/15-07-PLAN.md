<objective>
Create L4.13 Defective Verbs (al-Naqis) and L4.14 Assimilated Verbs (al-Mithal) — the second and third weak verb categories after hollow verbs.

Purpose: Defective verbs (final weak letter) are very common in the Quran — هَدَى, دَعَا, مَشَى. Their final letter interacts with case/mood markers, making them tricky. Assimilated verbs (initial weak letter) are simpler — the waw drops in present tense Form I. Teaching them together shows the contrast: final position = complex interaction with endings, initial position = simpler deletion rule.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with sound-vs-weak comparison tables, consistent format matching L4.12 hollow verbs.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "ihdina" from hada) — "ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ" [Al-Fatiha 1:6]. The root ه-د-ي has ي as the FINAL letter — defective verb. Notice the ي disappears in the imperative.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Conjugate defective verbs (weak final letter: rama, hada)
  2. Recognize final-letter deletion patterns
  3. Identify defective verbs in the Quran
- Connection: "In [L4.12](/learn/level-4/hollow-verbs), you learned hollow verbs (MIDDLE weak letter contracts). Now learn defective verbs — where the FINAL weak letter interacts with case/mood markers, causing the ending to change dramatically."

**Section 2 — Understanding Defective Verbs:**
- Plain English: "Defective verbs have و or ي as their LAST root letter. This letter collides with the endings that show person, tense, and mood. Sometimes it disappears, sometimes it changes to a different vowel, sometimes it stays."
- Arabic terminology: [defective verb](/resources/glossary#naqis) (an-nāqiṣ / النَّاقِص) — literally "deficient" because the final letter often drops
- Two subtypes:
  - **Defective-waw:** Final letter is و — e.g., دَعَا (daʿā, root د-ع-و) "he called"
  - **Defective-ya:** Final letter is ي — e.g., هَدَى (hadā, root ه-د-ي) "he guided"

**Sound vs Defective comparison (VerbConjugation):**

| Person | Sound: نَصَرَ | Defective-ya: هَدَى | Pattern Change |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| He (past) | نَصَرَ | هَدَى | ي → alif maqsura |
| She (past) | نَصَرَتْ | هَدَتْ | ي drops before تْ |
| They m. (past) | نَصَرُوا | هَدَوْا | ي → waw with suffix |
| He (present indic.) | يَنْصُرُ | يَهْدِي | ي stays |
| He (present subjunc.) | يَنْصُرَ | يَهْدِيَ | ي + fatha |
| He (jussive) | يَنْصُرْ | يَهْدِ | ي drops! |

- Also show defective-waw pattern with دَعَا for comparison
- Key insight: the final letter's behavior depends on what FOLLOWS it:
  - Alone → converts to alif (past) or stays as ي/و (present indicative)
  - Before consonant suffix → drops
  - Before vowel suffix → may change form
  - In jussive → drops

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha
- Show هَدَى forms: اِهْدِنَا (imperative), يَهْدِي (present), هَدَى (past)
- Full i'rab with root identification and defective pattern explanation

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Defective verbs have و or ي as the FINAL root letter. Past tense: final letter → alif (هَدَى, دَعَا). Present tense: final letter stays in indicative, takes fatha in subjunctive, DROPS in jussive. Before consonant suffixes: final letter drops."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse defective-waw (دَعَا) with defective-ya (هَدَى) in past tense — both end in alif! Check the dictionary for the root."
  - "In the jussive, the final letter drops: يَهْدِي → يَهْدِ (لَمْ يَهْدِ). Don't keep the ي!"
  - "Defective verbs are often cited as the hardest category — but the patterns are systematic. Focus on what happens to the final letter in each mood."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate هَدَى in past tense: he, she, they (m.), I"
  2. Mood forms (beginner): "Give three present tense forms of يَهْدِي: indicative, subjunctive, jussive. What happens to the ي?"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Parse اِهْدِنَا from Al-Fatiha: root, weak letter, category, why the form looks this way."
  4. Hollow vs defective comparison (intermediate): "Compare قَالَ (hollow) and هَدَى (defective). How does weak letter position change the conjugation behavior?"

title: "Assimilated Verbs (al-Mithal)"
level: 4
order: 14
description: "Conjugate assimilated verbs with weak initial letter, recognize initial-waw deletion in present tense, and identify assimilated verbs in Quranic verses."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Duha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "wa-wajadaka") — "وَوَجَدَكَ ضَالًّا فَهَدَىٰ" [Al-Duha 93:7] — "And He found you lost and guided [you]." The verb وَجَدَ (wajada) from root و-ج-د has و as the FIRST root letter.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Conjugate assimilated verbs (weak first letter: wajada, wasala)
  2. Recognize initial waw deletion patterns
  3. Identify assimilated verbs in Quranic verses
- Connection: "You've learned hollow verbs (middle weak) and defective verbs (final weak). Now learn assimilated verbs — where the FIRST root letter is weak. Good news: this is the SIMPLEST category. The main rule is: initial و drops in present tense Form I."

**Section 2 — Understanding Assimilated Verbs:**
- Plain English: "Assimilated verbs have و (rarely ي) as their FIRST root letter. In past tense, they're mostly normal. In present tense, the initial و simply disappears. That's the core pattern."
- Arabic terminology: [assimilated verb](/resources/glossary#mithal) (al-mithāl / المِثَال) — literally "example/paradigm" (named for being a model irregular pattern)
- The core rule: In Form I PRESENT TENSE, initial و DROPS:
  - وَجَدَ (wajada) → يَجِدُ (yajidu) — NOT يَوْجِدُ
  - وَصَلَ (waṣala) → يَصِلُ (yaṣilu) — NOT يَوْصِلُ
  - وَعَدَ (waʿada) → يَعِدُ (yaʿidu) — NOT يَوْعِدُ
  - وَلَدَ (walada) → يَلِدُ (yalidu) — NOT يَوْلِدُ

**Sound vs Assimilated comparison (VerbConjugation):**

| Person | Sound: كَتَبَ | Assimilated: وَجَدَ | Pattern Change |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| He (past) | كَتَبَ | وَجَدَ | Normal! و stays |
| She (past) | كَتَبَتْ | وَجَدَتْ | Normal! و stays |
| He (present) | يَكْتُبُ | يَجِدُ | و DROPS! |
| She (present) | تَكْتُبُ | تَجِدُ | و DROPS! |
| He (imperative) | اُكْتُبْ | جِدْ | Short form, no alif |

- When و STAYS (exceptions to deletion):
  - Past tense: always stays (وَجَدَ, وَصَلَ)
  - Derived forms (II-X): stays (أَوْجَدَ Form IV, تَوَاصَلَ Form VI)
  - Only drops in Form I present tense

**Common assimilated verb roots (GrammarTable):**
| Root | Past | Present | Meaning |
| و-ج-د | وَجَدَ (wajada) | يَجِدُ (yajidu) | to find |
| و-ص-ل | وَصَلَ (waṣala) | يَصِلُ (yaṣilu) | to arrive/connect |
| و-ع-د | وَعَدَ (waʿada) | يَعِدُ (yaʿidu) | to promise |
| و-ل-د | وَلَدَ (walada) | يَلِدُ (yalidu) | to give birth |
| و-ض-ع | وَضَعَ (waḍaʿa) | يَضَعُ (yaḍaʿu) | to place |
| و-ق-ع | وَقَعَ (waqaʿa) | يَقَعُ (yaqaʿu) | to occur |

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Duha
- Show وَجَدَ in various forms, plus other assimilated verbs
- i'rab showing root extraction where و is "missing" in present tense

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Assimilated verbs have و as the FIRST root letter. Core rule: initial و DROPS in Form I present tense (وَجَدَ → يَجِدُ). Past tense and derived forms: و STAYS normally. This is the simplest weak verb category."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "When you see يَجِدُ, don't think the root is ج-د — it's و-ج-د! The initial و dropped."
  - "Assimilated verbs with ي as the first letter (rare) behave differently: يَسُرَ (yasura) → يَيْسُرُ (stays). Focus on و-initial verbs."
  - "Don't apply the deletion rule to derived forms: Form IV أَوْجَدَ keeps the و."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate وَعَدَ: past (he, she), present (he, she), imperative"
  2. Root recovery (beginner): "The present tense يَصِلُ — what is the full root? Why does it look like only two root letters?"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find assimilated verbs in Surah Al-Duha. For each: extract root, identify initial و, explain deletion."
  4. Category comparison (intermediate): "Complete the table: for roots ق-و-ل (hollow), ه-د-ي (defective), و-ج-د (assimilated) — give past, present, jussive forms. Where does the weak letter change?"
