<objective>
Create L4.15 Hamzated Verbs — the final weak verb category, completing the four-category system. Hamzated verbs have ء in their root, causing spelling (not pronunciation) changes.

Purpose: Hamza is technically not a "weak letter" like و/ي, but its spelling irregularities justify teaching it alongside weak verbs. The key insight: hamza's SEAT (carrier letter) changes based on surrounding vowels. Common Quranic verbs like أَمَرَ (commanded), أَكَلَ (ate), سَأَلَ (asked), and قَرَأَ (read) are hamzated. This lesson completes the weak verb section of Level 4.

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file with hamza seat rules, common hamzated verb conjugation, and a summary comparing all four weak verb categories.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "inna a'tayna") — "إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ" [Al-Kawthar 108:1]. The verb أَعْطَى is Form IV from root ع-ط-ي (actually this is Form IV + defective). Better: use أَمَرَ type or find a clear hamzated verb in Al-Kawthar context. The root ء-م-ر (amara, to command) is a common hamzated verb.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand hamza spelling rules in verb conjugation
  2. Recognize hamza on alif, waw, ya, or on the line
  3. Conjugate hamzated verbs correctly
- Connection: "You've learned the three 'true' weak verb categories: hollow (middle و/ي), defective (final و/ي), assimilated (initial و). Now complete the picture with hamzated verbs — verbs with ء (hamza) as a root letter. The irregularity here is SPELLING, not pronunciation."

**Section 2 — Understanding Hamzated Verbs:**
- Plain English: "Hamza (ء) is the 'glottal stop' — a real consonant, unlike the weak و/ي that melt into vowels. But hamza creates SPELLING complications: it sits on different 'seats' (carrier letters) depending on the surrounding vowels."
- Arabic terminology: [hamzated verb](/resources/glossary#mahmuz) (al-mahm ūz / المَهْمُوز) — verb containing hamza as a root letter

**Hamza seat rules (the core concept):**
- Hamza needs a "seat" (carrier): ا (alif), و (waw), ئ (ya), or ء (line)
- The seat is determined by the STRONGEST surrounding vowel:
  - Kasra (ِ) is strongest → seat on يـ
  - Damma (ُ) is second → seat on و
  - Fatha (َ) is third → seat on ا
  - Sukun (ْ) is weakest → seat on line or alif

GrammarTable: Hamza Seat Decision
| Strongest Vowel | Seat | Example |
| Kasra | ئـ (under ya) | سُئِلَ (su'ila) |
| Damma | ؤ (on waw) | يَؤُمُّ (ya'ummu) |
| Fatha | أ (on alif) | أَمَرَ (amara) |
| No vowel/sukun | ء (on line) | قَرَأَ (qara'a) |

**Three positions of hamzated verbs:**
1. **Initial hamza (فاء الكلمة):** أَمَرَ (amara, root ء-م-ر) "commanded"
   - Hamza on alif in past: أَمَرَ, أَخَذَ, أَكَلَ
   - In present: may merge with prefix vowel
2. **Middle hamza (عين الكلمة):** سَأَلَ (sa'ala, root س-ء-ل) "asked"
   - Hamza seat changes based on surrounding vowels during conjugation
3. **Final hamza (لام الكلمة):** قَرَأَ (qara'a, root ق-ر-ء) "read"
   - Hamza seat changes based on preceding vowel

**VerbConjugation for أَمَرَ (initial hamza):**
Show 6-8 persons with hamza behavior noted

**VerbConjugation for سَأَلَ (middle hamza):**
Show key persons where hamza seat changes

**Common hamzated roots (GrammarTable):**
| Root | Past | Present | Meaning |
| ء-م-ر | أَمَرَ | يَأْمُرُ | to command |
| ء-خ-ذ | أَخَذَ | يَأْخُذُ | to take |
| ء-ك-ل | أَكَلَ | يَأْكُلُ | to eat |
| س-ء-ل | سَأَلَ | يَسْأَلُ | to ask |
| ق-ر-ء | قَرَأَ | يَقْرَأُ | to read |
| ج-ء-ي | جَاءَ | يَجِيءُ | to come |

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar and related surahs
- Show hamza in different positions and on different seats
- i'rab showing root extraction and hamza identification

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Hamzated verbs have ء as a root letter. The hamza SPELLING changes based on surrounding vowels (kasra → ya seat, damma → waw seat, fatha → alif seat, sukun → line). The PRONUNCIATION stays the same — only the written form changes."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Hamza changes are about SPELLING, not pronunciation. Don't be confused by the changing carrier letter — the sound is always a glottal stop."
  - "Initial hamza verbs (أَمَرَ) look normal in past tense. The irregularity shows more in present tense and when prefixes are added."
  - "Some common verbs simplify hamza: أَخَذَ → خُذْ (imperative drops the hamza entirely). These exceptions must be memorized: خُذْ (take), كُلْ (eat), مُرْ (command)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Seat identification (beginner): "What seat does hamza take in each word? أَمَرَ, سُئِلَ, قَرَأَ"
  2. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate أَكَلَ in past tense: he, she, they (m.). Note where hamza appears."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find hamzated verbs in these verses. For each: extract root, identify hamza position, explain seat."
  4. **Four-category summary (intermediate):** "Complete this comparison table: For each category (hollow, defective, assimilated, hamzated), give: (a) the weak letter position, (b) what changes in conjugation, (c) one example root."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** L4.11-14 (all weak verb categories), L1.04 (hamza introduction), L5.01
- Include a brief WEAK VERB SUMMARY section comparing all four categories in a final GrammarTable:

| Category | Weak Letter | Position | Key Change | Example |
|----------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| Hollow | و / ي | Middle | Contracts to long vowel | قَالَ → يَقُولُ |
| Defective | و / ي | Final | Changes/drops with endings | هَدَى → يَهْدِي → يَهْدِ |
| Assimilated | و | Initial | Drops in Form I present | وَجَدَ → يَجِدُ |
| Hamzated | ء | Any | Seat changes (spelling) | أَمَرَ → يَأْمُرُ |

"You now have the complete weak verb framework. Level 5 will apply this knowledge to analyzing full Quranic verses."
