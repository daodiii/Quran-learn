<objective>
Create L4.11 Weak Verbs Introduction (al-Fi'l al-Mu'tall) and L4.12 Hollow Verbs (al-Ajwaf) — establishing the weak verb categorization framework and teaching the first category.

Purpose: Weak verbs are consistently cited as the most challenging topic for learners (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2). L4.11 MUST establish the systematic recognition strategy that prevents memorization overwhelm. L4.12 then applies this strategy to hollow verbs (middle weak letter) — the most common weak verb category in the Quran. Teaching intro + first category together builds immediate confidence.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with categorization framework, recognition strategy, and hollow verb conjugation with sound-vs-weak comparison tables.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "ihdina" from hada) — "ٱهْدِنَا ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ" [Al-Fatiha 1:6]. The verb اِهْدِ is from root ه-د-ي — where ي is a WEAK letter at the end. This is why the verb looks different from regular sound verbs.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand weak verbs as containing a weak letter (waw, ya, hamza)
  2. Recognize how weak letters cause irregularities in conjugation
  3. Categorize weak verbs by position of weak letter
- Connection: "In Levels 2-3, you conjugated SOUND verbs — verbs with three strong consonants. Now meet WEAK verbs — verbs with و, ي, or ء as one of their root letters. These letters are 'weak' because they change, contract, or disappear during conjugation."

**Section 2 — Understanding Weak Verbs:**
- Plain English: "About 40% of Arabic verbs are 'weak' — they contain و (waw), ي (ya), or ء (hamza). These letters behave unpredictably: they can lengthen into vowels, disappear entirely, or change shape. But there IS a system — and once you learn it, weak verbs become predictable."
- English analogy: "English has irregular verbs too: 'go/went' (not 'goed'), 'see/saw' (not 'seed'). Arabic weak verbs are irregular for a specific REASON: the weak letter position determines the pattern."
- Arabic terminology:
  - [weak verb](/resources/glossary#fil-mutall) (al-fiʿl al-muʿtall / الفِعْلُ المُعْتَلّ) — verb with weak letter
  - [sound verb](/resources/glossary#fil-sahih) (al-fiʿl aṣ-ṣaḥīḥ / الفِعْلُ الصَّحِيح) — verb with all strong letters
  - [weak letters](/resources/glossary#huruf-illah) (ḥurūf al-ʿillah / حُرُوفُ العِلَّة) — و, ي, and sometimes ء

**Four categories by position (GrammarTable):**

| Category | Arabic Name | Weak Letter Position | Example | Pattern |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|---------|---------|
| Hollow (أَجْوَف / ajwaf) | الأَجْوَف | MIDDLE (2nd radical) | قَالَ (said) — root ق-و-ل | Most common |
| Defective (نَاقِص / nāqiṣ) | النَّاقِص | FINAL (3rd radical) | هَدَى (guided) — root ه-د-ي | Very common |
| Assimilated (مِثَال / mithāl) | المِثَال | INITIAL (1st radical) | وَجَدَ (found) — root و-ج-د | Common |
| Hamzated | المَهْمُوز | ANY position (hamza) | أَمَرَ (commanded) — root ء-م-ر | Spelling changes |

**CRITICAL — Recognition Strategy (15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2 prevention):**
- Four-step recognition strategy (box/highlight):
  1. **Find the root** — strip prefixes/suffixes, find 3 consonants
  2. **Check for weak letters** — is و, ي, or ء in the root?
  3. **Determine position** — 1st (assimilated), 2nd (hollow), 3rd (defective)
  4. **Apply category rules** — each position has predictable patterns

- Show the strategy applied to 3-4 examples:
  - يَقُولُ → root ق-و-ل → و is 2nd → HOLLOW
  - يَهْدِي → root ه-د-ي → ي is 3rd → DEFECTIVE
  - يَجِدُ → root و-ج-د → و is 1st → ASSIMILATED (و disappeared!)
  - يَأْمُرُ → root ء-م-ر → ء is 1st → HAMZATED

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha showing different weak verb categories
- For each: identify the verb, extract root, determine category
- Show how recognizing the category explains the "irregular" form

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Weak verbs contain و, ي, or ء as root letters. Four categories by position: Hollow (middle), Defective (final), Assimilated (initial), Hamzated (hamza). Use the 4-step strategy: Find root → Check for weak letters → Determine position → Apply rules."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't try to memorize individual conjugations — learn the CATEGORY RULES and apply them systematically."
  - "Some verbs have TWO weak letters (doubly weak): e.g., root و-ق-ي has both و and ي. These are rare and follow the rules of both categories."
  - "Hamza (ء) is technically not a 'weak letter' like و/ي, but its spelling irregularities justify grouping it here."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Categorization (beginner): "Categorize each verb: قَالَ, هَدَى, وَصَلَ, أَكَلَ, بَاعَ"
  2. Root extraction (beginner): "Extract the root and identify the weak letter: يَدْعُو, يَقُومُ, يَجِدُ"
  3. Recognition strategy (intermediate): "Apply the 4-step strategy to identify each verb in this Fatiha verse."
  4. Sound vs weak (intermediate): "Which of these verbs are sound and which are weak? How can you tell? كَتَبَ, نَصَرَ, قَالَ, فَهِمَ, مَشَى"

level: 4
order: 12
description: "Conjugate hollow verbs with weak middle letter, recognize middle-letter contraction patterns, and identify hollow verbs in Quranic context."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "qul" from qala) — "قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" [Al-Ikhlas 112:1]. The verb قُلْ is the imperative of قَالَ — a hollow verb from root ق-و-ل where the middle و contracts.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Conjugate hollow verbs (weak middle letter: qala, baa)
  2. Recognize middle-letter contraction patterns
  3. Identify hollow verbs in Quranic context
- Connection: "In [L4.11](/learn/level-4/weak-verbs-intro), you learned hollow verbs have a weak MIDDLE letter. Now learn exactly HOW that weak letter behaves — it contracts into long vowels, sometimes disappears, and sometimes reappears."

**Section 2 — Understanding Hollow Verbs:**
- Plain English: "A hollow verb has و or ي as its middle root letter. This letter is 'unstable' — it changes to a long vowel (ā, ū, ī) depending on the conjugation. Think of it as a letter that 'melts' into a vowel sound."
- Arabic terminology: [hollow verb](/resources/glossary#ajwaf) (al-ajwaf / الأَجْوَف) — literally "hollow/empty" because the middle seems to disappear
- Two subtypes:
  - **Hollow-waw (أَجْوَف وَاوِي):** Middle letter is و — e.g., قَالَ (root ق-و-ل), صَامَ (root ص-و-م)
  - **Hollow-ya (أَجْوَف يَائِي):** Middle letter is ي — e.g., بَاعَ (root ب-ي-ع), سَارَ (root س-ي-ر)

**Sound vs Hollow comparison (15-RESEARCH.md Code Examples — CRITICAL):**
VerbConjugation showing side-by-side comparison:

| Person | Sound: كَتَبَ (kataba) | Hollow: قَالَ (qāla) | Pattern Change |
|--------|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|
| He (past) | كَتَبَ | قَالَ | و contracts → ā |
| She (past) | كَتَبَتْ | قَالَتْ | Contraction maintained |
| They m. (past) | كَتَبُوا | قَالُوا | و reappears with suffix |
| He (present) | يَكْتُبُ | يَقُولُ | و appears as ū |
| He (jussive) | يَكْتُبْ | يَقُلْ | و disappears completely! |
| He (imperative) | اُكْتُبْ | قُلْ | Short form, no alif needed |

Use selective transliteration in the table rows (per 15-RESEARCH.md Open Question 3: transliterate first mention of each verb root and pattern-change rows).

**Pattern principles (NOT memorization — 15-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 2):**
1. **Vowel context:** Short vowel before weak letter → weak letter contracts to long vowel
2. **Consonant suffix:** When suffix starts with consonant → weak letter contracts
3. **Vowel suffix:** When suffix starts with vowel → weak letter may reappear
4. **Jussive/imperative:** Weak letter often drops entirely (قَالَ → يَقُلْ → قُلْ)

**Common hollow verb roots (GrammarTable):**
| Root | Past | Present | Meaning |
| ق-و-ل | قَالَ (qāla) | يَقُولُ (yaqūlu) | to say |
| ك-و-ن | كَانَ (kāna) | يَكُونُ (yakūnu) | to be |
| ص-و-م | صَامَ (ṣāma) | يَصُومُ (yaṣūmu) | to fast |
| ب-ي-ع | بَاعَ (bāʿa) | يَبِيعُ (yabīʿu) | to sell |
| ز-و-ر | زَارَ (zāra) | يَزُورُ (yazūru) | to visit |
| خ-و-ف | خَافَ (khāfa) | يَخَافُ (yakhāfu) | to fear |

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas and Al-Fatiha
- Full morphological i'rab: Root + Hollow verb identification + contraction pattern
- Show قُلْ (imperative), قَالَ (past), يَقُولُ (present) from same root
- At least one hollow-ya example (بَاعَ or similar)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Hollow verbs have و or ي as the MIDDLE root letter. Past tense: weak letter → long vowel (ā). Present tense: weak letter → long vowel (ū or ī). Jussive/imperative: weak letter may DROP entirely. Principle: learn the PATTERN, not individual conjugations."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't panic when the middle letter 'disappears' — it contracted into the vowel. قُلْ still comes from ق-و-ل."
  - "Hollow-waw verbs (قَالَ) and hollow-ya verbs (بَاعَ) follow SLIGHTLY different vowel patterns in present tense: يَقُولُ (ū) vs يَبِيعُ (ī)."
  - "In the jussive (لَمْ يَقُلْ), the و/ي drops AND the vowel shortens. This is the most common form to misread."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate قَالَ in past tense for: he, she, they (m.), I."
  2. Sound vs hollow (beginner): "Why does كَتَبَ → يَكْتُبُ but قَالَ → يَقُولُ? Explain the difference."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find hollow verbs in these verses. For each: extract root, identify weak letter, explain contraction."
  4. Pattern prediction (intermediate): "Given root ز-و-ر (visiting), predict: past tense (he), present tense (he), jussive (he), imperative."
