<objective>
Create L4.07 Maf'ul Mutlaq (Absolute Object), L4.08 Maf'ul li-Ajlih (Object of Cause), and L4.09 Maf'ul Ma'ah (Object of Accompaniment) — the three specialized maf'ul types.

Purpose: These three accusative functions complete the accusative case system. Maf'ul mutlaq uses a masdar from the SAME root as the verb (emphasizes or specifies). Maf'ul li-ajlih gives the REASON for an action. Maf'ul ma'ah expresses ACCOMPANIMENT using waw. Together they show that Arabic accusative is far more nuanced than "direct object."

Output: 3 complete MDX lesson files with progressive maf'ul type teaching, connecting back to masdar knowledge from L3.17.

level: 4
order: 7
description: "Understand the absolute object as a masdar used to emphasize or specify the verb's action, and identify absolute objects in Quranic verses."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Zilzal (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "zalzalaha") — "إِذَا زُلْزِلَتِ ٱلْأَرْضُ زِلْزَالَهَا" [Al-Zilzal 99:1] — "When the earth is shaken with its earthquake." Here زِلْزَالَهَا is the maf'ul mutlaq — a masdar from the SAME root (ز-ل-ز-ل) as the verb زُلْزِلَتِ.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand the absolute object (masdar used to emphasize or specify)
  2. Recognize accusative case on maf'ul mutlaq
  3. Identify absolute objects in Quranic verses
- Connection: "In [L3.17](/learn/level-3/verbal-nouns), you learned that every verb has a masdar (verbal noun). Now learn what happens when you use that masdar RIGHT AFTER its own verb — it creates the absolute object, one of Arabic's most powerful emphasis tools."

**Section 2 — Understanding Maf'ul Mutlaq:**
- Plain English: "The absolute object is when you say 'He hit a hitting' or 'She smiled a beautiful smile.' The masdar repeats the verb's meaning to either EMPHASIZE (how intensely) or SPECIFY (what kind of action)."
- English analogy: "English has a faint version: 'I dreamed a dream,' 'fight the good fight.' Arabic does this systematically with specific grammar rules."
- Arabic terminology: [absolute object](/resources/glossary#maful-mutlaq) (mafʿūl muṭlaq / مَفْعُول مُطْلَق) — literally "unrestricted object"
- Three functions:
  1. **Emphasis (tawkid):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا — "I hit him a hitting" (= I definitely hit him)
  2. **Specification of type (naw'):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبًا شَدِيدًا — "I hit him a severe hitting" (= I hit him hard)
  3. **Specification of number ('adad):** ضَرَبْتُهُ ضَرْبَتَيْنِ — "I hit him two hittings" (= I hit him twice)
- Key rule: The masdar MUST come from the SAME ROOT as the verb (or a synonym root)
- Always accusative (mansub)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Zilzal and related surahs
- Full i'rab showing: verb identification → root extraction → masdar recognition → maf'ul mutlaq classification
- Show at least one emphasis type and one specification type
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for 2 examples

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "The maf'ul mutlaq is a masdar from the SAME ROOT as the verb, placed in the accusative case after the verb. Three functions: (1) Emphasis — bare masdar, (2) Type specification — masdar + adjective, (3) Number specification — masdar + number."
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse maf'ul mutlaq with maf'ul bihi (direct object): The direct object receives the action (I hit HIM). The absolute object reinforces the action itself (I hit a HITTING)."
  - "The masdar MUST share the root with the verb: ضَرَبَ ضَرْبًا (correct, same root ض-ر-ب). ضَرَبَ قَتْلًا (incorrect, different root)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Find the maf'ul mutlaq and its verb: فَرِحَ فَرَحًا شَدِيدًا"
  2. Function classification (beginner): "Is this maf'ul mutlaq for emphasis, type, or number?"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Parse زِلْزَالَهَا in Al-Zilzal 99:1 as maf'ul mutlaq. What function does it serve?"
  4. Construction (intermediate): "Create maf'ul mutlaq sentences for root ك-ت-ب using all three functions."

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: "The Maf'ul li-Ajlih (Object of Cause)"
level: 4
order: 8
description: "Understand maf'ul li-ajlih as expressing the reason or purpose of an action, and identify causal expressions in the Quran."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: causal expressions) — find a verse where a masdar explains WHY an action was done. E.g., an action done "out of fear" or "seeking reward."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand maf'ul li-ajlih as expressing reason/purpose
  2. Recognize accusative case on causal objects
  3. Identify causal expressions in the Quran
- Connection: "In [L4.07](/learn/level-4/absolute-object), you learned the absolute object reinforces the action. Now learn the object of CAUSE — a masdar that explains WHY the action was done."

**Section 2 — Understanding Maf'ul li-Ajlih:**
- Plain English: "The object of cause answers 'WHY?' with a single accusative word. 'I stood up out of respect' — 'respect' is the maf'ul li-ajlih."
- English analogy: "'She cried for joy,' 'He ran in fear.' English uses prepositions. Arabic can express the reason directly in accusative case."
- Arabic terminology: [object of cause](/resources/glossary#maful-li-ajlih) (mafʿūl li-ajlih / مَفْعُول لِأَجْلِهِ) — literally "object for its sake"
- Conditions for maf'ul li-ajlih:
  1. Must be a masdar (abstract noun of action)
  2. Must share the same DOER as the main verb
  3. Must share the same TIME as the main verb
  4. Must express the REASON for the main action
- Example: قُمْتُ إِجْلَالًا — "I stood up (out of) reverence"
  - قُمْتُ = main verb, إِجْلَالًا = masdar in accusative = reason
- If conditions not met, use preposition لِ instead: جِئْتُ لِلتَّعَلُّمِ — "I came for learning"

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah
- i'rab showing the causal masdar and its grammatical analysis
- Show at least one example with the maf'ul li-ajlih conditions clearly met

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule"
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Not every reason word is maf'ul li-ajlih — it must be a masdar, share the doer and time with the verb. If ANY condition fails, use preposition لِ instead."
  - "Don't confuse with maf'ul mutlaq: mutlaq reinforces WHAT (the action). Li-ajlih explains WHY (the reason)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox covering identification, condition verification, Quranic analysis, and mutlaq vs li-ajlih distinction.

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** L4.07, L4.09, L3.17 (masdar), L5.01

**=== L4.09 Maf'ul Ma'ah ===**

**Frontmatter:**
```yaml
---
title: "The Maf'ul Ma'ah (Object of Accompaniment)"
level: 4
order: 9
description: "Understand maf'ul ma'ah as expressing accompaniment using waw al-ma'iyyah, and identify accompaniment expressions in the Quran."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Hud (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) — find verse with waw expressing accompaniment.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Understand maf'ul ma'ah as expressing accompaniment (wa = "along with")
  2. Recognize accusative case after wa in this context
  3. Identify accompaniment expressions in the Quran
- Connection: "You've learned objects of emphasis (L4.07) and cause (L4.08). Now complete the maf'ul trilogy with the object of accompaniment — where وَ means 'along with,' not 'and.'"

**Section 2 — Understanding Maf'ul Ma'ah:**
- Plain English: "Sometimes وَ doesn't mean 'and' — it means 'along with.' 'I walked AND the riverbank' really means 'I walked ALONG the riverbank.' The word after this special وَ takes accusative case."
- English analogy: "'She arrived with the sunset.' The sunset isn't a second subject — it's the accompaniment."
- Arabic terminology: [object of accompaniment](/resources/glossary#maful-ma-ah) (mafʿūl maʿahu / مَفْعُول مَعَهُ) — literally "object with it"
- وَ المَعِيَّة (waw al-maʿiyyah) — the waw of accompaniment
- Key distinction: وَ العَطْف (conjunction = and) vs وَ المَعِيَّة (accompaniment = along with)
  - سَارَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَالنَّهْرَ — "Muhammad walked along the river" (accompaniment — river is accusative)
  - سَارَ مُحَمَّدٌ وَعَلِيٌّ — "Muhammad and Ali walked" (conjunction — Ali is nominative)
- How to tell the difference: If the second noun can logically do the same action, it's conjunction (atf). If not, it's accompaniment (ma'iyyah).

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-4 ArabicExample from Surah Hud and related surahs
- Show waw al-ma'iyyah clearly distinguished from regular conjunction waw

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": waw al-ma'iyyah + accusative = accompaniment
- Callout type="warning" (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse waw al-ma'iyyah (along with) with regular waw al-atf (and) — test: can both nouns do the action? Yes = conjunction, No = accompaniment."
  - "Don't make the accompanied noun nominative — after waw al-ma'iyyah it MUST be accusative."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox covering waw type identification, case determination, Quranic analysis, and a summary exercise comparing all three maf'ul types (mutlaq, li-ajlih, ma'ah).

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** L4.07, L4.08, L2.05, L5.01
- Include a brief SUMMARY comparing all five accusative functions learned across L4: hal, tamyiz, maf'ul mutlaq, maf'ul li-ajlih, maf'ul ma'ah. A final GrammarTable showing: Type | Function | Example | Key Question Answered.
