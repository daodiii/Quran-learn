key-decisions:
  - "30/70 guided-to-independent ratio for maximum learner independence in capstone lessons"
  - "Master reference tables serve as both review tool and permanent reference"
  - "Root ayn-lam-mim chosen for sarf synthesis tracing through 10 derived forms (most common educational root)"
  - "Course completion celebration includes achievement milestones for all 5 levels + journey reflection + practical next steps"

patterns-established:
  - "Synthesis lesson pattern: master reference tables + guided example + independent practice + milestone"
  - "Root tracing: single root analyzed through all its Quranic occurrences showing derivation in action"
  - "Course completion: achievement summary + journey reflection (L1.01 to L5.16) + practical next steps"

# Phase 16 Plan 09: Nahw & Sarf Synthesis (Course Finale) Summary

**Nahw and sarf capstone lessons with master reference tables, synthesis exercises, and course completion celebration — 750 total lines, completing the entire 73-lesson curriculum**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~12 min
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2
- **Total lines:** 750 (303 + 447)

## Accomplishments

- **L5.15 Nahw Synthesis:** Three master reference GrammarTables (sentence types, case system summary, particle effects), guided synthesis of Al-Imran 3:169, 5 independent practice verses from diverse surahs, 30/70 guided-to-independent ratio
- **L5.16 Sarf Synthesis (FINAL LESSON):** Four master reference tables (root system, verb forms I-X, derived noun types, weak verb categories), guided root ع-ل-م tracing through 10 derived forms, independent practice words, Level 5 completion milestone, course completion celebration (73/73 lessons), journey reflection (L1.01→L5.16), What's Next guidance
- **73-lesson curriculum COMPLETE:** All 16 Level 5 lessons created, completing the full 73-lesson Quranic Arabic Grammar curriculum

## Task Commits

Both tasks created in current session (wave-3):

1. **Task 1: L5.15 Nahw Synthesis** — created in current session
   - Three master reference nahw tables
   - Guided synthesis + 5 independent verses
   - 303 lines

2. **Task 2: L5.16 Sarf Synthesis** — created in current session
   - Four master reference sarf tables
   - Root ع-ل-م tracing + independent practice
   - Course completion celebration
   - 447 lines

## Files Created

- **src/content/lessons/level-5/15-nahw-synthesis.mdx** — Nahw capstone synthesizing all syntax knowledge: sentence type reference (nominal, verbal, conditional, oath, interrogative), case system summary (nominative/accusative/genitive functions), particle effects table (inna/kaana/negation/conditional/exception/emphasis). Guided synthesis of Al-Imran 3:169 + 5 independent practice verses
- **src/content/lessons/level-5/16-sarf-synthesis.mdx** — Sarf capstone and FINAL LESSON (73 of 73): root system reference, verb forms I-X summary with meaning changes, derived noun types (8 categories), weak verb categories (4 types). Guided root ع-ل-م analysis through 10 Quranic forms. Level 5 + course completion milestones with journey reflection spanning L1.01 to L5.16

## Decisions Made

- **30/70 ratio:** Maximum independence appropriate for capstone — students prove competence
- **Master reference tables as dual-purpose:** Both review tool during lesson and permanent reference for future study
- **Root ع-ل-م:** Most widely studied Arabic root in educational contexts, appears extensively in Quran (knowledge/learning/teaching)
- **Course completion structure:** Achievement milestones by level + journey reflection + practical next steps (tafsir, corpus, classical i'rab)

## Deviations from Plan

L5.15 at 303 lines is below 450+ target. Content is complete but more concise — the 30/70 ratio means less guided content and more exercise space. L5.16 at 447 lines approaches the 450 target with all required sections.

## Issues Encountered

Standard diacritics and terminology validator warnings. Known limitations.

## User Setup Required

None.
