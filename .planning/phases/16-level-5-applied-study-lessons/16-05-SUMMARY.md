# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 16-level-5-applied-study-lessons
    provides: Pattern recognition skills (L5.06) and i'rab method (L5.01)
provides:
  - Deep analysis of three oath particles (waw, ba, ta al-qasam)
  - Oath vs conjunction waw distinction tests
  - Complete Ash-Shams guided analysis (10 oaths + response)
  - Cross-surah oath comparison (Ash-Shams, Al-Layl, Ad-Duha, At-Tin, Al-'Adiyat)
  - Oath response markers (inna, laqad, la, ma)
affects: [16-level-5-applied-study-lessons (narrative-section)]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Deep single-pattern analysis (oath structure in depth)
    - Oath particle + genitive + response grammatical framework
    - Cross-surah comparison of variable elements (oath count, object choice, response type)

key-files:
  created:
    - src/content/lessons/level-5/08-oath-formulas.mdx
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Oath formulas analyzed as three-part structure: particle + genitive noun + response (jawab al-qasam)"
  - "Waw al-qasam vs conjunction waw taught via two concrete tests (sentence-initial position, genitive without governing preposition)"
  - "Variable elements emphasized: oath count (intensity), object choice (thematic), response type (affirmation/negation)"

patterns-established:
  - "Three oath particles: waw (~100 times, created things), ba (with Allah), ta (rare, with Allah)"
  - "Oath always takes genitive case — no exceptions"
  - "Response markers: inna (indeed), laqad (certainly), la (emphatic lam), ma (negation)"

# Phase 16 Plan 05: Oath Formulas Lesson Summary

**Deep analysis of Quranic oath structures (qasam) with three particles, oath/conjunction distinction, and cross-surah comparison — 608 lines**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~10 min
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07
- **Tasks:** 1
- **Files created:** 1
- **Total lines:** 608

## Accomplishments

- **L5.08 Oath Formulas in the Quran:** Three oath particles (waw, ba, ta al-qasam), oath vs conjunction waw distinction with concrete tests, complete Ash-Shams 91:1-10 guided analysis (10 oaths building rhetorical intensity before response), cross-surah comparison (3 main + 2 additional surahs), oath response markers
- **Completes pattern recognition trio:** L5.06 (breadth), L5.07 (genre-specific), L5.08 (single-pattern depth)

## Task Commits

1. **Task 1: L5.08 Oath Formulas** — created in previous session
   - Three oath particles with grammatical analysis
   - Complete Ash-Shams guided analysis
   - Cross-surah comparison GrammarTable
   - 608 lines

## Files Created

- **src/content/lessons/level-5/08-oath-formulas.mdx** — Deep analysis of Quranic oath grammar: three oath particles (waw/ba/ta), always-genitive rule, oath vs conjunction waw distinction tests, complete Ash-Shams (91:1-10) analysis showing 10 oaths with qad response, cross-surah comparison table (Ash-Shams/Al-Layl/Ad-Duha), additional examples from At-Tin and Al-'Adiyat

## Decisions Made

- **Three-part oath structure:** particle + genitive noun + response as consistent framework
- **Concrete distinction tests:** Position-based and case-based tests for oath vs conjunction waw
- **Variable element analysis:** How oath count, object choice, and response type all vary while structure stays consistent

## Deviations from Plan

None. 608 lines exceeds 350+ minimum. All success criteria met.

## Issues Encountered

Standard diacritics validator warnings on short words. Known limitation.

## User Setup Required

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- **Pattern section complete:** L5.06-08 provide full pattern recognition skills
- **Ready for narrative section:** L5.09-10 apply analysis skills to prophet stories
- **No blockers**
