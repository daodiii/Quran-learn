<objective>
Create L5.15 Comprehensive Review: Nahw Synthesis and L5.16 Comprehensive Review: Sarf Synthesis — the final two lessons of the entire 73-lesson curriculum.

Purpose: These lessons synthesize ALL knowledge from Levels 1-5. L5.15 reviews syntax (nahw): sentence types, cases, particles, clause types, and rhetorical syntax. L5.16 reviews morphology (sarf): roots, patterns, verb forms I-X, derived nouns, and weak verbs. Both use mixed verses from diverse surahs to test comprehensive analysis ability. L5.16 includes the Level 5 AND course completion milestone. Uses 30/70 guided-to-independent ratio (maximum independence per research recommendation).

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files (450+ lines each) with synthesis exercises, comprehensive reference tables, and course completion celebration.

title: "Comprehensive Review: Nahw Synthesis"

order: 15
description: "Synthesize all syntax (nahw) knowledge from Levels 1-5, applying sentence analysis, case system, particles, and clause types to mixed Quranic verses."
draft: false

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Context: "This is the nahw (syntax) capstone. You've learned sentence types (L2), cases (L2.04-06), particles (L2.10-11, L4.03-06), clause types (L4.01-02), and rhetorical syntax (L5.12-14). Now prove you can apply ALL of these simultaneously to ANY verse."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Synthesize all syntax knowledge in integrated verse analysis
  2. Demonstrate ability to analyze any Quranic sentence structure
  3. Apply syntactic analysis across diverse verse types
- Connection: "Every lesson has built toward this moment. L5.01 gave you the method. L5.02-14 provided practice. Now: independent analysis with minimal guidance."

**Section 2 — Nahw Master Reference:**
Comprehensive GrammarTable synthesizing ALL syntax concepts:

**Table 1: Sentence Types**
| Type | Arabic | Starts With | Key Features | Example |
Nominal, verbal, conditional, oath, interrogative

**Table 2: Case System Summary**
| Case | Arabic | Marker | Primary Functions | Example |
Nominative (mubtada, fa'il, ism inna, ism kaana)
Accusative (maf'ul bihi, hal, tamyiz, khabar kaana, ism inna, maf'ul mutlaq/li-ajlih/ma'ah)
Genitive (mudaf ilayh, object of preposition, na't of genitive, oath object)

**Table 3: Particle Effects**
| Category | Particles | Effect on Case | Example |
Inna sisters, kaana sisters, negation particles, conditional particles, exception particles, emphasis particles

**Section 3 — Guided Synthesis Example (30% guided):**
One verse analyzed with ALL nahw concepts simultaneously:
- Choose a moderately complex verse from a surah not previously analyzed in detail
- Demonstrate: sentence type identification → case marking → particle effects → clause type → rhetorical syntax
- Show how concepts INTERACT (e.g., inna changes case AND creates emphasis AND affects word order)

**Section 4 — Independent Practice Verses (70% independent):**
Present 4-5 verses from mixed surahs (diverse structures):
- One nominal sentence with idafah chain
- One verbal sentence with multiple objects
- One conditional sentence
- One verse with rhetoric (taqdim or hadhf)
- One complex verse with multiple clauses

For each, provide ONLY: the verse (ArabicExample) and a hint about what to analyze. Students do the analysis independently.

Answer keys provided in ExerciseBox reveal sections.

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Sentence type analysis (guided): "Identify the sentence type of each verse. For nominal: find mubtada/khabar. For verbal: find fi'l/fa'il/maf'ul." — 4 mixed verses
  2. Case justification (intermediate): "For each underlined word, state: (a) its case, (b) its function, (c) WHY it has that case." — 5 words from mixed verses
  3. Particle interaction (intermediate): "Analyze how the particle changes the grammar. (a) إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ... (b) كَانَ ٱللَّهُ... (c) لَمْ يَكُنْ... Show before/after case changes."
  4. Full nahw analysis (advanced): "Choose ANY verse from Surah Al-Baqarah (2:1-20). Perform complete syntactic analysis: sentence type, every word's function and case, particle effects, clause types. This is your nahw capstone."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** Comprehensive cross-references to ALL syntax lessons: L2.01-11, L4.01-10, L5.01-14. Next: L5.16 (Sarf Synthesis).

description: "Synthesize all morphology (sarf) knowledge from Levels 1-5, applying root analysis, verb forms, derived nouns, and weak verb rules to mixed Quranic words."
draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Context: "This is the sarf (morphology) capstone — and the FINAL LESSON of the entire 73-lesson curriculum. You've learned roots (L3.01), verb forms I-X (L3.02, L3.10-15), derived nouns (L3.16-18), and weak verbs (L4.11-15). Now synthesize: analyze ANY Arabic word's morphological structure."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Synthesize all morphology knowledge in integrated word analysis
  2. Demonstrate ability to extract root, identify pattern, and determine form for any Quranic word
  3. Apply morphological analysis to weak verbs, derived nouns, and complex forms
- Connection: "L5.15 synthesized nahw (how words connect). Now synthesize sarf (what words ARE). Together, these final two lessons demonstrate complete analytical capability."

**Section 2 — Sarf Master Reference:**
Comprehensive GrammarTable synthesizing ALL morphology concepts:

**Table 1: Root System**
| Root Type | Letters | Example | Derived Words |
Trilateral (3), quadrilateral (4), augmented

**Table 2: Verb Forms I-X Summary**
| Form | Pattern (Past) | Pattern (Present) | Meaning Change | Example |
All 10 forms with key meaning shifts (Form II intensive, Form III mutual, Form IV causative, etc.)

**Table 3: Derived Noun Types**
| Type | Arabic | Pattern | Example | Function |
Active participle, passive participle, masdar, ism makan, ism zaman, ism ala, sifah mushabbahah, mubalagha

**Table 4: Weak Verb Categories**
| Category | Weak Letter Position | Subtype | Key Change | Example |
Hollow (middle), defective (final), assimilated (initial), hamzated

**Section 3 — Guided Synthesis Example (30% guided):**
One Quranic word chain analyzed with ALL sarf concepts:
- Take a root (e.g., ع-ل-م) and trace it through multiple forms appearing in a single passage
- Show: root extraction → form identification → meaning derivation → pattern matching → weak verb rules (if applicable)
- Demonstrate the "derivation chain" from root to all attested forms

**Section 4 — Independent Practice Words (70% independent):**
Present 5-6 Quranic words from diverse morphological categories:
- One Form I verb (regular)
- One Form II-IV verb (augmented)
- One Form V-X verb (ta- prefix or complex)
- One active participle
- One masdar
- One weak verb (hollow or defective)

For each, provide ONLY: the word in context (ArabicExample) and category hint. Students extract root, identify form, explain meaning.

Answer keys in ExerciseBox reveals.

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Root extraction (guided): "Extract the trilateral root for each word: (a) مُسْلِمُونَ, (b) ٱسْتَغْفَرَ, (c) تَعَالَىٰ, (d) مَقَامًا" — 4 words from mixed surahs
  2. Form identification (intermediate): "Identify the verb form (I-X) for each: (a) عَلَّمَ, (b) أَنزَلَ, (c) تَوَاصَوْا, (d) ٱسْتَكْبَرَ. Name the form and its typical meaning change."
  3. Weak verb analysis (intermediate): "Analyze these weak verbs: (a) قَالَ (hollow), (b) هَدَى (defective), (c) وَجَدَ (assimilated). For each: identify the weak letter, its position, and what change occurs in conjugation."
  4. Complete sarf analysis (advanced): "Choose ANY 5 consecutive words from Al-Baqarah 2:255 (Ayat al-Kursi). For each word: extract root, identify pattern/form, classify (verb/noun/particle), and explain the morphological derivation. This is your sarf capstone."

**Section 6 — Level 5 Completion Milestone:**

- Recognize patterns across multiple surahs (oaths, du'a, narrative, rhetoric)
- Track dialogue speakers through grammatical markers
- Identify parallelism, rhetorical questions, and word order emphasis
- Synthesize nahw and sarf for comprehensive Quranic analysis

### Course Completion Celebration
"You have completed ALL 73 LESSONS of the Quranic Arabic Grammar course."

Achievement milestones:
- Level 1 (Foundation): 11 lessons — Alphabet to basic sentences
- Level 2 (Core Grammar): 11 lessons — Cases, sentence types, idafah, inna/kaana
