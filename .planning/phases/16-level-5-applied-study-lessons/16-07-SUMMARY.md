# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 16-level-5-applied-study-lessons
    provides: Narrative analysis (L5.09-10) and balagha introduction (L4.16-17)
provides:
  - Four dialogue types classified by grammatical structure (narrative, divine command, prophetic address, eschatological)
  - Speaker identification methods beyond qaala/qaaluu
  - Three parallelism types (structural, refrain/takrar, antithetical)
  - Complete Ar-Rahman refrain analysis with word-by-word i'rab
  - Cross-surah refrain comparison (Ar-Rahman, Al-Qamar, Al-Mursilat)
affects: [16-level-5-applied-study-lessons (rhetorical-questions, word-order)]

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - Dialogue type classification by grammatical markers
    - Parallelism type taxonomy (structural, refrain, antithetical)
    - Refrain analysis showing grammatical function of repeated verses
    - Cross-genre dialogue comparison

  created:
    - src/content/lessons/level-5/11-dialogue-patterns.mdx
    - src/content/lessons/level-5/12-parallelism-repetition.mdx
  modified: []

key-decisions:
  - "Four dialogue types classified by grammatical structure, not by content or speaker identity"
  - "Parallelism analyzed as three distinct types: structural (same pattern, different content), refrain (exact repetition), antithetical (parallel contrasts)"
  - "Ar-Rahman refrain chosen as primary case study for dual form (jinn+humans) and Form II intensive denial analysis"
  - "Bridge position: L5.11 generalizes narrative skills, L5.12 begins rhetoric section"

patterns-established:
  - "Dialogue classification: narrative (qaala), divine command (qul), prophetic address (ya ayyuha), eschatological (yaquulu future)"
  - "Refrain grammar: repeated verses have consistent internal grammar regardless of varying context"
  - "Antithetical parallelism: same conditional structure (amma) applied to opposite actions"

# Phase 16 Plan 07: Dialogue & Parallelism Lessons Summary

**Dialogue type classification and parallelism/repetition analysis bridging narrative to rhetoric — 1035 total lines**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~12 min
- **Completed:** 2026-02-07
- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2
- **Total lines:** 1035 (658 + 377)

## Accomplishments

- **L5.11 Dialogue Patterns in the Quran:** Four dialogue types classified by grammatical markers (narrative qaala, divine command qul, prophetic address ya ayyuha, eschatological yaquulu), advanced speaker identification beyond simple qaala/qaaluu, cross-genre examples
- **L5.12 Parallelism & Repetition:** Three parallelism types (structural, refrain/takrar, antithetical), complete Ar-Rahman refrain word-by-word i'rab (fa+bi-ayyi+alaa'+rabbikumaa+tukadhdhibaan), dual form analysis (jinn+humans), Form II intensive denial, cross-surah refrain comparison
- **Narrative-to-rhetoric bridge:** L5.11 generalizes L5.09-10 dialogue skills; L5.12 transitions to applied rhetoric

## Task Commits

Tasks executed across sessions (wave-2 parallel):

1. **Task 1: L5.11 Dialogue Patterns** — created in previous session
   - Four dialogue types with grammatical markers
   - Cross-genre dialogue examples
   - 658 lines

2. **Task 2: L5.12 Parallelism & Repetition** — created in current session
   - Three parallelism types
   - Complete Ar-Rahman refrain analysis
   - 377 lines

## Files Created

- **src/content/lessons/level-5/11-dialogue-patterns.mdx** — Generalized dialogue grammar analysis: four types classified by grammatical markers (narrative qaala/qaaluu, divine command qul, prophetic address ya ayyuha alladhiina aamanuu, eschatological present-tense-for-future). Advanced speaker identification via pronoun chains, explicit naming, and verb conjugation
- **src/content/lessons/level-5/12-parallelism-repetition.mdx** — Applied rhetoric analysis: structural parallelism (Ar-Rahman V2-4 verb+object), refrain repetition (Ar-Rahman V13 fa-bi-ayyi 31 times with full i'rab), antithetical parallelism (Al-Layl 92:5-10 amma contrasts). Cross-surah comparison with Al-Qamar and Al-Mursilat

## Decisions Made

- **Grammar-based classification:** Dialogue types classified by grammatical structure (markers, verb forms, particles) rather than content
- **Ar-Rahman as primary case study:** 31 repetitions provide most extensive data for refrain analysis
- **Dual form significance:** Ar-Rahman's dual pronouns (kumaa/tukadhdhibaan) analyzed as addressing both jinn and humans simultaneously
- **Form II intensive:** takdhib (Form II of k-dh-b) analyzed as intensive denial vs simple lying

## Deviations from Plan

L5.12 at 377 lines is slightly below 400+ target. Content covers all required topics without redundancy.

## Issues Encountered

Standard diacritics and terminology validator warnings. Known limitations.

## User Setup Required

None.

## Next Phase Readiness

- **Rhetoric section underway:** L5.12 establishes parallelism/repetition
- **Ready for rhetorical questions and word order:** L5.13-14 complete the applied rhetoric section
- **No blockers**
