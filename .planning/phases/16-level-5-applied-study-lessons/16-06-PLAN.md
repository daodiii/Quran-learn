<objective>
Create L5.09 Story Narratives: Prophet Ibrahim and L5.10 Story Narratives: Prophet Musa — the narrative grammar analysis pair.

Purpose: Quranic narratives use distinctive grammatical patterns: past tense dominance, قَالَ/قَالُوا dialogue markers, speaker shift tracking, and conditional cause-effect structures. L5.09 establishes the narrative grammar toolkit using Ibrahim's story (simpler dialogue structure). L5.10 applies it to Musa's story (complex multi-speaker dialogues with Pharaoh). Together they show how CONSISTENT narrative grammar patterns work across different prophet stories. Uses 40/60 guided-to-independent ratio.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files (450+ lines each) with dialogue tracking, speaker shift analysis, narrative grammar comparison tables, and 3-4 exercises each.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Context: "Quranic narratives aren't just stories — they use distinctive grammar to convey meaning. Past tense dominates events. قَالَ and قَالُوا track speakers. Conditionals create cause-effect. You'll learn to analyze these patterns in Prophet Ibrahim's powerful dialogues."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Identify the core narrative grammar toolkit (past tense, dialogue markers, speaker shifts)
  2. Analyze Ibrahim's dialogue structure in Ash-Shu'ara 26:69-89
  3. Track speakers through verb agreement (singular قَالَ vs plural قَالُوا)
- Connection: Reference L5.01 (method), L4.03 (conditionals). Note: "You've analyzed surahs (L5.02-05) and patterns (L5.06-08). Now analyze NARRATIVE passages — a different Quranic genre."

**Section 2 — The Narrative Grammar Toolkit:**
Follow 16-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4 structure.

Five core narrative grammar elements:
1. **Past tense (māḍī) dominance** — Events told in past tense
2. **Dialogue markers** — قَالَ (he said), قَالُوا (they said), قُلْنَا (We said)
3. **Quoted speech** — Direct quotes are grammatically independent clauses
4. **Speaker shift markers** — Verb number/gender agreement tracks speakers
5. **Temporal/conditional structures** — إِذْ (when, at that time), إِنْ/إِذَا (if/when)

GrammarTable: Dialogue Markers — follow the 16-RESEARCH.md Narrative Dialogue Analysis table:
| Arabic Marker | Grammatical Function | Speaker Information | Example |

**Section 3 — Guided Analysis: Ibrahim's Dialogue (Ash-Shu'ara 26:69-82):**
Follow the 16-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4 detailed example structure.

**Verse 69: Narrative Introduction**
- ArabicExample: وَٱتْلُ عَلَيْهِمْ نَبَأَ إِبْرَٰهِيمَ [Ash-Shu'ara 26:69]
- ٱتْلُ: imperative (command to Prophet), Root ت-ل-و
- نَبَأَ: masdar "news/story" — introduces narrative genre
- إِبْرَٰهِيمَ: accusative (mudaf ilayh in idafah), proper name

**Verse 70: Ibrahim Speaks — Opening Question**
- ArabicExample: إِذْ قَالَ لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِۦ مَا تَعْبُدُونَ [26:70]
- إِذْ: temporal particle "when" — locates dialogue in past
- قَالَ: dialogue marker, masculine singular = Ibrahim
- لِأَبِيهِ وَقَوْمِهِ: indirect object (لِ + genitive)
- مَا تَعْبُدُونَ: interrogative + present tense = quoted speech

**Verse 71: People Respond — Speaker Shift**
- ArabicExample: قَالُوا نَعْبُدُ أَصْنَامًا فَنَظَلُّ لَهَا عَٰكِفِينَ [26:71]
- قَالُوا: PLURAL = people speaking (shift from singular)
- First-person plural نَعْبُدُ — people speaking about themselves
- أَصْنَامًا: accusative (maf'ul bihi), indefinite plural "idols"

**Verses 72-82: Dialogue Flow**
Continue tracking the قَالَ/قَالُوا alternation through the passage. Show 3-4 more verse pairs demonstrating the consistent pattern. For later verses, condense the analysis — focus on speaker tracking and key grammatical features rather than exhaustive word-by-word analysis.

Dialogue Flow Chart:
```
V70: قَالَ (Ibrahim) → asks question
V71: قَالُوا (People) → answer
V72: قَالَ (Ibrahim) → counter-question
V73: قَالُوا (People) → admission
V75-82: قَالَ (Ibrahim) → extended argument
```

**Section 4 — Additional Passage: As-Saffat 37:83-111 (Ibrahim and the Sacrifice):**
Brief analysis of a second Ibrahim narrative showing:
- Different narrative structure (action-focused, not dialogue-focused)
- Past tense event sequence
- Conditional structure: فَلَمَّا أَسْلَمَا (when they both submitted) [37:103]
- How grammar shifts when narrative moves from dialogue to action

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Dialogue tracking (guided): "Read Ash-Shu'ara 26:69-77. For each قَالَ/قَالُوا, identify: Who is speaking? How do you know? What verb form marks the speaker?"
  2. Tense analysis (intermediate): "In Ibrahim's argument (26:78-82), most verbs shift from past to present tense. Why? What grammatical effect does present tense create in a past narrative?"
  3. Quoted speech (intermediate): "Analyze the grammar of Ibrahim's quoted speech in V70: مَا تَعْبُدُونَ. What sentence type? What mood? Why present tense in a past narrative context?"
  4. Passage analysis (advanced): "Read As-Saffat 37:102-107 (the sacrifice dialogue). Apply the narrative grammar toolkit: identify dialogue markers, track speakers, analyze the conditional فَلَمَّا."

title: "Story Narratives: Prophet Musa"
level: 5
order: 10
description: "Analyze complex narrative structures with multiple speakers in Prophet Musa's story from Ta-Ha and Al-Qasas, building on narrative grammar patterns from L5.09."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Context: "Prophet Musa's story is the MOST narrated in the Quran — it appears in over 20 surahs. The grammar is more complex than Ibrahim's: multiple speakers (Musa, Pharaoh, the people, Allah), rapid dialogue shifts, and extensive action sequences. This lesson builds on L5.09's toolkit for complex multi-speaker analysis."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Analyze multi-speaker dialogue with rapid speaker shifts
  2. Track dialogue through complex narrative with 3+ speakers
  3. Compare narrative grammar patterns between Ibrahim and Musa stories
- Connection: Reference L5.09 (toolkit established). Note: "Ibrahim's dialogue had two parties (Ibrahim vs people). Musa's has MULTIPLE parties — the grammar must track more speakers."

**Section 2 — Guided Analysis: Musa's Encounter (Ta-Ha 20:9-36):**
Apply narrative grammar toolkit to Musa's commission:

**Verses 9-16: Allah Speaks to Musa**
- ArabicExample key verses showing divine speech markers
- قُلْنَا or divine first-person narration
- Imperative commands to Musa: اِخْلَعْ نَعْلَيْكَ (remove your shoes), فَٱسْتَمِعْ (listen)
- Grammar: divine speech uses majestic plural (نَحْنُ), imperatives for command

**Verses 17-23: Dialogue Between Allah and Musa**
- Rapid question-answer: مَا تِلْكَ بِيَمِينِكَ يَٰمُوسَىٰ — What is in your right hand?
- قَالَ: Musa responds — his speech identified by singular + context
- Interrogative structures, demonstrative pronouns
- Vocative يَٰمُوسَىٰ — marks addressee explicitly

**Verses 24-36: Musa's Mission to Pharaoh**
- ٱذْهَبْ إِلَىٰ فِرْعَوْنَ — imperative command establishing mission
- Musa's du'a (V25-35): رَبِّ ٱشْرَحْ لِي صَدْرِي — personal du'a in narrative
- Grammar transition: narrative → du'a → back to narrative

**Section 3 — Complex Dialogue: Pharaoh's Court (Ta-Ha 20:49-73):**

Multiple speakers in rapid succession:
- قَالَ (singular) — could be Musa OR Pharaoh (context determines)
- فِرْعَوْنُ explicitly named when clarity needed
- Magic contest: past tense action sequence
- فَأُلْقِيَ ٱلسَّحَرَةُ سُجَّدًا (passive voice for magicians' prostration)

Show 4-5 verses tracking speaker shifts. Demonstrate how context + verb form + explicit naming work together to track speakers in complex dialogue.

**Section 4 — Comparison: Al-Qasas 28:7-13 (Musa's Childhood):**
Brief analysis of a different Musa narrative section:
- Multiple female speakers (Musa's mother, sister, Pharaoh's wife)
- قَالَتْ (feminine singular) tracking female speakers
- أَوْحَيْنَا (divine inspiration — different from dialogue)
- How feminine verb markers distinguish speakers

**Section 5 — Ibrahim vs Musa Narrative Comparison:**
GrammarTable comparing narrative grammar features (following 16-RESEARCH.md Pattern 4 comparison table):
| Feature | Ibrahim (Ash-Shu'ara) | Musa (Ta-Ha) |
| Speakers | 2 parties | 3+ parties |
| Dialogue marker | قَالَ vs قَالُوا | قَالَ + explicit naming |
| Speaker identification | Verb number alone | Number + naming + context |
| Quoted speech | Interrogative dominated | Mixed (command, question, du'a) |
| Narrative structure | Dialogue-heavy | Mixed dialogue + action |

**Section 6 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Speaker tracking (guided): "Read Ta-Ha 20:49-56. For each قَالَ, identify: Who is speaking (Musa or Pharaoh)? What grammatical clues help you determine the speaker?"
  2. Feminine markers (intermediate): "In Al-Qasas 28:7-13, find all instances of قَالَتْ. Who is the speaker in each case? How does the context + feminine marker help?"
  3. Grammar transition (intermediate): "Musa's du'a in Ta-Ha 20:25-35 interrupts the narrative. Analyze the grammar shift: How does the text transition from narrative (past tense) to du'a (imperative) and back?"
  4. Comparative analysis (advanced): "Compare the opening of Ibrahim's story (Ash-Shu'ara 26:69-70) with Musa's story (Ta-Ha 20:9-12). How do the narrative introductions differ grammatically? What does each structure emphasize?"
