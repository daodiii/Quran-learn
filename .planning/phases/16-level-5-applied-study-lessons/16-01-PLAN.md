<objective>
Create L5.01 Full I'rab Analysis Method — the foundational lesson establishing the systematic 5-step analysis framework used in ALL subsequent Level 5 lessons.

Purpose: This lesson transitions learners from individual grammar concepts (L1-L4) to simultaneous application of ALL concepts on any Quranic verse. It teaches the METHOD, not new grammar. The Bismillah serves as the guided example because it is universally familiar and demonstrates idafah, adjective agreement, ellipsis, and rhetorical analysis in a single phrase. Every subsequent L5 lesson applies this method.

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file (450+ lines) with the 5-step systematic method, complete Bismillah guided analysis (nahw + sarf + balagha), and 3-4 exercises applying the method to progressively complex verses.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample showing Bismillah — "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ" [Al-Fatiha 1:1]. Frame: "You've spent four levels learning individual grammar tools. Now put them ALL together — analyze complete verses systematically."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Apply a systematic 5-step analysis method to any Quranic verse
  2. Integrate nahw (syntax), sarf (morphology), and balagha (rhetoric) in unified analysis
  3. Synthesize all concepts from Levels 1-4 simultaneously
- Connection: "This is where everything comes together. In [Level 2](/learn/level-2), you mastered case endings. In [Level 3](/learn/level-3), you explored morphology. In [Level 4](/learn/level-4), you studied advanced constructions and rhetoric. Now you'll apply ALL of these tools to every word in a verse."
- Callout type="tip": "Level 5 teaches NO new grammar concepts. Instead, you learn to APPLY everything simultaneously. Think of it as learning to play a song after mastering individual notes."

**Section 2 — The Systematic I'rab Method (5 Steps):**
Follow the 16-RESEARCH.md Pattern 1 structure exactly.

**Step 1: Segment the Verse (التقطيع)**
- Break verse into grammatical units (words and phrases)
- Identify each unit's boundaries
- Group connected words (jarr wa-majrur, idafah pairs, adjective-noun)

**Step 2: Identify Sentence Type (تحديد نوع الجملة)**
- Nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah) — begins with noun
- Verbal sentence (jumlah fi'liyyah) — begins with verb
- Check for ellipsis (hadhf) — is an expected element missing?

**Step 3: Analyze Each Word — Three-Level Analysis**
For EACH word, provide:

*Syntactic Analysis (Nahw):*
- Function: What role does this word play? (mubtada, khabar, fa'il, maf'ul bihi, jarr wa-majrur, na't, mudaf, mudaf ilayh, hal, tamyiz, etc.)
- Case/Mood: Raf' (nominative), nasb (accusative), jarr (genitive), jazm (jussive)
- Case Marker: Damma, fatha, kasra, sukun, or their equivalents for special declensions
- Reason: WHY this case? (subject of nominal sentence, object of verb, object of preposition, adjective agreement, etc.)

*Morphological Analysis (Sarf):*
- Root: Three-letter root with semantic field
- Pattern: Morphological pattern (wazn)
- Form: Verb form (I-X) or noun derivation type
- Definiteness: How is it made definite/indefinite?

*Rhetorical Analysis (Balagha):*
- Is there any deviation from standard Arabic? (word order, ellipsis, emphasis)
- What rhetorical device is being used? (taqdim, hadhf, tashbih, isti'arah, etc.)
- What is the PURPOSE of this choice?

**Step 4: Map Relationships (رسم العلاقات)**
- How do words connect? (subject-predicate, verb-object, modifier-modified, idafah, jarr wa-majrur attachment)
- What grammatical chains exist? (idafah chains, adjective chains, conjunctions)

**Step 5: Rhetorical Analysis (التحليل البلاغي)**
- What is the overall rhetorical effect of the verse?
- Why was THIS sentence structure chosen over alternatives?
- How does grammar serve meaning?

GrammarTable summarizing the 5 steps: Step | Arabic Name | Question Answered | Tools Used
1. Segment | التقطيع | What are the grammatical units? | Word boundaries
2. Sentence Type | تحديد نوع الجملة | Nominal or verbal? | L1.10, L2.01-03
3. Word Analysis | الإعراب التفصيلي | What is each word? | L2.04-06, L3.01-18
4. Relationships | رسم العلاقات | How do words connect? | L2.07-11, L4.01-15
5. Rhetoric | التحليل البلاغي | Why this arrangement? | L4.16-17

**Section 3 — Guided Example: Complete Bismillah Analysis:**
Follow the 16-RESEARCH.md Code Example "Complete I'rab Analysis Format" structure.

Full 5-step analysis of "بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ" [Al-Fatiha 1:1]:
- Step 1: Segment into بِسْمِ | ٱللَّهِ | ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ | ٱلرَّحِيمِ
- Step 2: Nominal sentence with hadhf (verb أَبْدَأُ omitted)
- Step 3: Complete three-level analysis for each of the 4 words (as shown in research Code Examples). Use ArabicExample for the full verse, then detailed analysis underneath.
  - بِسْمِ: jarr wa-majrur, genitive, Root س-م-و, pattern اِسْمٌ, hadhf + taqdim
  - ٱللَّهِ: mudaf ilayh, genitive, proper noun, idafah makes بِسْمِ definite
  - ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ: na't (adjective), genitive, Root ر-ح-م, pattern فَعْلَان (intensive), mubalagha
  - ٱلرَّحِيمِ: na't (second adjective), genitive, Root ر-ح-م, pattern فَعِيل (intensive)
- Step 4: Map relationships — idafah chain, adjective chain, ellipsis attachment
- Step 5: Verse-level balagha — hadhf (conciseness), taqdim (exclusivity), dual mercy attributes (comprehensiveness), saj' (rhyme beauty)

Callout type="tip": "Notice how a single 4-word phrase contains idafah, adjective agreement, ellipsis, and four balagha devices. This is why systematic analysis matters — each step reveals layers of meaning."

**Section 4 — Second Guided Example (Partial):**
Brief 5-step analysis of a second verse, such as "ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ" [Al-Fatiha 1:2], to show the method applied to a different structure (mubtada-khabar with badal). This example can be more condensed — showing the method in practice without the detailed explanation of each step.

**Section 5 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "The Systematic I'rab Method: (1) Segment the verse into grammatical units. (2) Identify sentence type (nominal/verbal + check for ellipsis). (3) Analyze each word at three levels: syntax (function + case), morphology (root + pattern), rhetoric (devices + purpose). (4) Map relationships between words. (5) Analyze overall rhetorical effect. Apply this method to EVERY verse you study in Level 5."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't try to analyze every single detail of every word. Focus on MAJOR structures first (sentence type, main verb/subject, objects), then add layers."
  - "Always complete syntactic analysis (Step 3 nahw) BEFORE morphological analysis (Step 3 sarf). Function matters more than form."
  - "Balagha (Step 5) requires understanding the grammar first. Never skip straight to rhetoric."
- Callout type="tip": "Prioritize UNDERSTANDING over COMPLETENESS. Classical scholars debated some parsings for centuries. Your goal is systematic competency, not exhaustive mastery."

**Section 6 — Practice:**
- 4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Method application (guided): "Apply Steps 1-2 to this verse from Surah Al-Ikhlas: قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ [Al-Ikhlas 112:1]. Segment the verse and identify the sentence type."
  2. Word analysis (intermediate): "Complete Step 3 (syntactic analysis only) for each word in: ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ [Al-Fatiha 1:2]. Give function, case, marker, and reason."
  3. Relationship mapping (intermediate): "For Bismillah, draw the relationship map: which words modify which? Which are in idafah? Which are adjectives?"
  4. Full analysis (advanced): "Apply ALL 5 steps to: رَبِّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ [Al-Fatiha 1:2]. Include nahw, sarf, and at least one balagha observation."

**Section 7 — Related Lessons:**
