<objective>
Create the 2 independent root lessons for Level 2: L2.01 The Nominal Sentence (Jumlah Ismiyyah) and L2.04 The Nominative Case (Raf'). These have no Level 2 prerequisites and form the foundation that all other Level 2 lessons build upon.

Purpose: L2.01 expands the nominal sentence concept introduced in L1.10 from simple identification to structural analysis with i'rab. L2.04 transitions from case RECOGNITION (L1.11) to case MASTERY — teaching WHEN and WHY the nominative case applies. Together they unlock the sentence structure chain (L2.02, L2.03) and the case system chain (L2.05, L2.06).

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files following the mandatory 5-part structure with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples, i'rab analysis (NEW for Level 2), and 3-4 practice exercises each.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox (all from @components/mdx/)

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas — "قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" (qul huwa llāhu aḥadun) "Say: He is Allah, [the] One" [Al-Ikhlas 112:1]. The clause "هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" is a nominal sentence — it starts with a noun/pronoun and describes a state. Level 2 teaches you to ANALYZE these structures.
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Define a nominal sentence as beginning with a noun
  2. Understand the two essential components: subject and predicate
  3. Identify nominal sentences in Quranic verses
- Connection: "In [L1.10](/learn/level-1/simple-sentences), you learned to RECOGNIZE that Arabic has two sentence types. In [L1.11](/learn/level-1/case-endings), you spotted case endings. Now let's understand the nominal sentence DEEPLY — its structure, its components, and how to analyze it grammatically."
- Key Level 2 transition: "Level 1 was about RECOGNITION. Level 2 is about MASTERY — learning WHEN and WHY."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Nominal Sentence:**
- Plain English first: "A nominal sentence is simply a sentence that starts with a noun or pronoun. It typically describes a STATE or makes a statement about something, rather than describing an action."
- English analogy: "Think of nominal sentences like name tags with descriptions. 'The sky [is] blue' — you're naming something (the sky) and describing it (blue). Arabic does the same thing, but without needing the word 'is'."
- Introduce Arabic terminology with bilingual first-mention format: [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة)
- Two essential components:
  - [Subject](/resources/glossary#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — "The thing being talked about"
  - [Predicate](/resources/glossary#khabar) (khabar / خَبَر) — "What is being said about it"
- Key insight: Arabic nominal sentences have NO equivalent of English "is/am/are" — the connection is IMPLICIT
- GrammarTable showing the structure: Subject (mubtadaʾ) + Predicate (khabar) = Complete nominal sentence, with 3-4 simple examples
- Types of predicates: single word, phrase, or sentence (brief mention — detailed in L2.02)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah)
- Each example must include i'rab analysis using the THREE-PART FORMAT:
  - **Word** (transliteration): Function (bilingual) — Case (bilingual), marked by [marker]
  - **Function:** What role it plays
  - **Case reason:** WHY it takes that case
- Example i'rab format (from 13-RESEARCH.md):
  ```
  **I'rab Analysis:**
  - **هُوَ** (huwa): Subject (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — Pronoun (no visible case marker)
    - **Function:** The topic being identified
    - **Case reason:** Pronouns in subject position are considered nominative

  - **ٱللَّهُ** (allāhu): Predicate (khabar / خَبَر) — Nominative (rafʿ / رَفْع), marked by damma (ـُ)
    - **Function:** Identifies who the pronoun refers to
    - **Case reason:** Predicates of nominal sentences take nominative case
  ```
- Show pattern: Subject (nominative) + Predicate (nominative) = Nominal sentence
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse (PDGY-07)
- All Arabic fully vocalized with transliteration (Level 2 = full transliteration per STYLE_GUIDE.md)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "A nominal sentence (jumlah ismiyyah) starts with a noun or pronoun. It has exactly TWO essential parts: (1) the subject (mubtadaʾ) — what you're talking about, and (2) the predicate (khabar) — what you're saying about it. Both typically take nominative case (rafʿ). Arabic does NOT use 'is', 'am', or 'are' — the meaning is implied."
- Callout type="warning" (Common Mistakes — PDGY-05):
  - "Don't look for 'is' — Arabic nominal sentences connect subject and predicate without a linking verb"
  - "Don't confuse nominal with verbal sentences — check the FIRST meaningful word. If it's a noun/pronoun, it's nominal. If it's a verb, it's verbal (covered in L2.03)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Is this verse a nominal or verbal sentence? What is the first word — noun or verb?" (use a clear Quranic example)
  2. Analysis (beginner): "In this nominal sentence, identify the subject (mubtadaʾ) and predicate (khabar)."
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide the i'rab for the subject and predicate in this verse — state the function, case, and reason."
  4. Synthesis (intermediate): "Find all nominal sentences in these three short verses. For each, identify the subject and predicate."
- Each answer must include detailed explanation with i'rab analysis
- Answers use the same three-part format as Section 3

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Introduction to Simple Sentences](/learn/level-1/simple-sentences) — "Where you first learned the two sentence types"
- Previous: [Introduction to Case Endings](/learn/level-1/case-endings) — "Where you learned to recognize case markers"
- Next: [Subject & Predicate](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate) — "Deep dive into mubtadaʾ and khabar types and agreement"
- Next: [The Verbal Sentence](/learn/level-2/verbal-sentence) — "The other sentence type — starting with a verb"
- Reference: [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart)

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic text (Level 2 = full transliteration)
- Use simplified ALA-LC transliteration per STYLE_GUIDE.md Section 2
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format for all grammar terms per TERMINOLOGY.md
- I'rab analysis must use three-part format: Function + Case marker + Reason
- One major concept per lesson (PDGY-08): nominal sentence structure ONLY — detailed mubtadaʾ/khabar types are L2.02

level: 2
order: 4
description: "Master when and why nouns take the nominative case in Arabic grammar."

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah An-Nasr (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — e.g., "إِذَا جَاءَ نَصْرُ ٱللَّهِ وَٱلْفَتْحُ" showing nominative subjects after a verb.
- Key transition from Level 1: "In [L1.11](/learn/level-1/case-endings), you learned to RECOGNIZE the nominative case — the damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ) on noun endings. Now let's learn WHEN and WHY a noun takes this case."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand when and why nouns take nominative case
  2. Recognize nominative markers: damma, waw (dual/plural), alif (sound masculine plural)
  3. Apply nominative case to subjects in both sentence types
- Connection: "You can already spot damma endings. This lesson teaches you the RULES behind them."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Nominative Case:**
- Plain English first: "The nominative case is the 'default' case for the important players in a sentence — the subject (the doer or the topic) and the predicate (what's being said). If a noun is 'doing' or 'being', it's likely nominative."
- English analogy: "In English, pronouns change form based on role: 'HE helped HIM' — 'he' is the subject form (like nominative), 'him' is the object form. Arabic applies this same idea to ALL nouns, not just pronouns."
- Introduce Arabic terminology: [nominative case](/resources/glossary#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْع) — "the raised case" (Arabic name suggests elevation — subjects are 'raised' in importance)
- Nominative markers:
  - **Singular:** damma (ـُ) definite / dammatain (ـٌ) indefinite
  - **Dual:** alif-nun (ـَانِ)
  - **Sound masculine plural:** waw-nun (ـُونَ)
  - **Sound feminine plural:** damma on taa (ـَاتُ)
- GrammarTable showing all nominative markers across singular, dual, plural
- **Four functions that take nominative case:**
  1. Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ)
  2. Predicate of nominal sentence (khabar / خَبَر)
  3. Subject of verbal sentence — [doer](/resources/glossary#fail) (fāʿil / فَاعِل)
  4. Deputy agent (nāʾib al-fāʿil / نَائِبُ ٱلْفَاعِل) — brief mention only, detailed in Level 3

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah An-Nasr (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah)
- EVERY example must include detailed i'rab analysis with three-part format:
  - Word function + case + reason
  - Explicitly state: "Nominative because it is the [function] of the [sentence type]"
- Show examples of:
  - Nominative subject in a nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ)
  - Nominative predicate in a nominal sentence (khabar)
  - Nominative subject (fāʿil) in a verbal sentence
  - Coordinated nominative nouns joined by وَ (wa-)
- Pattern summary after examples: "Subject/Predicate = Nominative (rafʿ)"
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse (PDGY-07)
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "The nominative case (rafʿ / رَفْع) marks four grammatical functions: (1) Subject of nominal sentence (mubtadaʾ), (2) Predicate of nominal sentence (khabar), (3) Subject/doer of verbal sentence (fāʿil), (4) Deputy agent in passive (nāʾib al-fāʿil — Level 3). To identify: ask 'What is being talked about?' or 'Who did the action?' — that noun is nominative."
- Callout type="warning" (Common Mistakes — PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse subject with object in verbal sentences. Arabic verbal sentences use Verb-Subject-Object order — the noun AFTER the verb is the subject (nominative), NOT the object."
  - "Don't forget coordinated subjects — when two nouns are joined by وَ (and), BOTH take nominative if the first is nominative."
  - "Don't apply nominative everywhere — objects take accusative (L2.05), and nouns after prepositions take genitive (L2.06)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Which words are nominative in this verse? What ending marks them?"
  2. Function (beginner): "For each nominative word, state its function: mubtadaʾ, khabar, or fāʿil"
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for all nouns in this verse — state function, case, marker, and reason"
  4. Contrast (intermediate): "In this verse, some nouns are nominative and some are NOT. Identify which are nominative and explain why the others are different cases (don't need to name the other cases yet — just say 'not nominative because...')"
- Each answer includes full i'rab with three-part format

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Introduction to Case Endings](/learn/level-1/case-endings) — "Where you first learned to recognize case markers"
- Next: [The Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/accusative-case) — "The second case — when nouns receive actions"
- Related: [The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence) — "Subject and predicate structure"
- Reference: [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart)

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic text (Level 2)
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format per TERMINOLOGY.md
- I'rab analysis must use three-part format: Function + Case marker + Reason
- Focus on WHEN/WHY (Level 2 mastery), not just WHAT (Level 1 recognition)
- One major concept per lesson (PDGY-08): nominative case rules ONLY — accusative is L2.05, genitive is L2.06
