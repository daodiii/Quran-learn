## Deliverables

### L2.05 The Accusative Case (Nasb) — 576 lines
- **Surah examples:** Al-Falaq (113:1-5) — all 5 verses analyzed with complete i'rab
- **Four accusative functions taught:** Direct object (mafʿūl bih), circumstantial expressions (ḥāl), subject of inna (ism inna), predicate of kaana (khabar kāna)
- **Accusative markers table:** Singular (fatha/fathatain), dual (ya-nun), SMP (ya-nun), SFP (kasra), broken plural (fatha/fathatain)
- **I'rab analysis:** Full three-part format on all 5 Quranic examples + all 4 exercises
- **Exercises:** 4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty (identification → inna conversion → kaana analysis → three-case contrast)
- **Cross-references:** L2.04 (prerequisite), L2.06 (next), L2.10/L2.11 (forward), case-endings-chart (resource)

## Validation Results

- **Diacritics:** Warnings on isolated morphemes (كَانَ, جَاءَ) at 67% — accepted per 12-03 decision for citation forms
- **All Quranic text:** Fully vocalized at ≥70%
- **Terminology:** Bilingual first-mention format throughout

## Decisions
- Al-Falaq chosen for L2.05 accusative case examples (shows case contrasts in short verses)
- Sound feminine plural kasra overlap between genitive and accusative explicitly taught as learning point
- كَانَ and إِنَّ previewed briefly with forward references to L2.10/L2.11 (one concept per lesson maintained)
