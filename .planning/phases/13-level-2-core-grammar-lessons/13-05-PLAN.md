<objective>
Create the 2 special particle lessons: L2.10 Inna and Her Sisters and L2.11 Kaana and Her Sisters. Both modify nominal sentences by changing the case of one component.

Purpose: These lessons teach how particles (inna) and auxiliary verbs (kaana) enter nominal sentences and alter their case assignments. Inna puts the subject in accusative; kaana puts the predicate in accusative. Together they demonstrate that the nominative "default" for nominal sentences has important exceptions. They also complete the Level 2 curriculum.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples with i'rab analysis showing case changes, and 3-4 practice exercises each.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — "إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَانَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ" (inna l-insāna la-fī khusrin) "Indeed, mankind is in loss" [Al-Asr 103:2]. Point out that ٱلْإِنسَانَ ends with fatha (accusative), NOT damma (nominative) — even though it's the subject!
- Opening: "In [L2.01](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence) and [L2.02](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate), you learned that subjects take nominative case. But what if a particle comes before the sentence and CHANGES the rules? That's exactly what inna and her sisters do."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand how inna and similar particles affect nominal sentences
  2. Learn that these particles put the subject in accusative case
  3. Identify inna sentences in the Quran
- Connection: "This lesson builds on your knowledge of nominal sentences (L2.01-L2.02) and the accusative case (L2.05)."

**Section 2 — Understanding Inna and Her Sisters:**
- Plain English first: "Inna and her sisters are special particles that enter nominal sentences and shake up the case system. Normally, both subject and predicate are nominative. When inna enters, the SUBJECT becomes ACCUSATIVE while the predicate stays nominative. Think of inna as an emphasis particle — 'Indeed!', 'Surely!'"
- English analogy: "Imagine if adding the word 'Indeed' to 'The boy is smart' changed the grammar: 'Indeed the boyACCUSATIVE is smart.' English doesn't do this, but Arabic does — the emphasis particle physically changes the noun's ending."
- Introduce: inna and her sisters (inna wa-akhawātuhā / إِنَّ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا)

- **The six sisters (GrammarTable):**
  1. **إِنَّ** (inna) — "Indeed, verily" (emphasis)
  2. **أَنَّ** (anna) — "that" (used in reported speech)
  3. **كَأَنَّ** (kaʾanna) — "as if" (comparison)
  4. **لَٰكِنَّ** (lākinna) — "but, however" (contrast)
  5. **لَيْتَ** (layta) — "if only, would that" (wish)
  6. **لَعَلَّ** (laʿalla) — "perhaps, maybe" (hope)
- GrammarTable: particle, meaning, example sentence, highlighting case change

- **The case change:**
  - BEFORE inna: Subject (nominative) + Predicate (nominative)
  - AFTER inna: Subject (ACCUSATIVE) + Predicate (nominative)
  - Introduce: subject of inna (ism inna / اِسْمُ إِنَّ) and predicate of inna (khabar inna / خَبَرُ إِنَّ)
- Show before/after comparison: "ٱللَّهُ كَرِيمٌ" (allāhu karīmun) → "إِنَّ ٱللَّهَ كَرِيمٌ" (inna llāha karīmun) — note the damma → fatha change on ٱللَّهَ

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr
- Each with detailed i'rab analysis showing:
  - The particle (inna or a sister)
  - The subject — now ACCUSATIVE (with reason: "accusative because it is the subject of inna")
  - The predicate — still NOMINATIVE (with reason: "predicate of inna remains nominative")
- Show different sisters if possible (inna is most common in Al-Asr, but show variety where available)
- Contrast with a plain nominal sentence to highlight what changed
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Inna and her six sisters (إِنَّ، أَنَّ، كَأَنَّ، لَٰكِنَّ، لَيْتَ، لَعَلَّ) enter nominal sentences and CHANGE the subject to accusative case. The predicate stays nominative. Remember: Subject of inna = ACCUSATIVE. Predicate of inna = NOMINATIVE."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't change BOTH subject and predicate — only the SUBJECT becomes accusative. The predicate stays nominative."
  - "Don't confuse inna's subject with a regular accusative object — it's still the topic of the sentence, just with a different case marker"
  - "The particle إِنَّ (inna — emphasis) is different from إِنْ (in — conditional 'if'). The double nun (shadda) matters!"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Find the subject of inna in this verse — what case does it take? Why?"
  2. Case change (beginner): "This nominal sentence uses inna. Write the subject with the correct case ending."
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for all components: the particle, its subject, and its predicate"
  4. Sister identification (intermediate): "Identify which 'sister' is used in each verse and explain its meaning and grammatical effect"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Subject & Predicate](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate) — "Normal nominal sentence structure"
- Companion: [Kaana and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/kaana-sisters) — "The other set of particles that modify nominal sentences (changes PREDICATE instead)"
- Contrast: "Inna changes SUBJECT case; Kaana changes PREDICATE case — learn both to master nominal sentence modifications"

**Critical requirements:** Full tashkeel, full transliteration, i'rab three-part format, bilingual terminology, one concept per lesson (PDGY-08: inna and her sisters ONLY — kaana is L2.11). EMPHASIZE the before/after case change with visual contrast.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — "وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُۥ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ" (wa-lam yakun lahū kufuwan aḥadun) "Nor is there to Him any equivalent" [Al-Ikhlas 112:4]. Note يَكُن (yakun) is from kaana, and كُفُوًا (kufuwan) is the predicate in accusative.
- Opening: "In [L2.10](/learn/level-2/inna-sisters), you learned that inna changes the SUBJECT to accusative. Kaana and her sisters do the OPPOSITE — they change the PREDICATE to accusative while the subject stays nominative."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand how kaana and similar verbs function in nominal sentences
  2. Learn that these verbs put the predicate in accusative case
  3. Identify kaana sentences in Quranic context
- Connection: "This is the companion to L2.10. Together, inna and kaana cover all the major modifications to nominal sentences."

**Section 2 — Understanding Kaana and Her Sisters:**
- Plain English first: "Kaana (كَانَ) means 'was' or 'used to be' — it adds a time dimension to a nominal sentence. 'The boy is smart' becomes 'The boy WAS smart.' But in Arabic, adding kaana also changes the PREDICATE's case to accusative."
- English analogy: "English just adds 'was': 'The boy is smart' → 'The boy was smart.' Arabic does the same, but also marks the change grammatically: the predicate ending switches from damma (nominative) to fatha (accusative)."
- Introduce: kaana and her sisters (kāna wa-akhawātuhā / كَانَ وَأَخَوَاتُهَا)

- **Key sisters (GrammarTable):**
  1. **كَانَ** (kāna) — "was, used to be"
  2. **أَصْبَحَ** (aṣbaḥa) — "became (in the morning)"
  3. **أَمْسَىٰ** (amsā) — "became (in the evening)"
  4. **ظَلَّ** (ẓalla) — "remained, continued to be"
  5. **صَارَ** (ṣāra) — "became"
  6. **لَيْسَ** (laysa) — "is not" (negation)
  7. **مَا زَالَ** (mā zāla) — "still, continues to be"
  8. **مَا دَامَ** (mā dāma) — "as long as"
- GrammarTable: verb, meaning, example, with case markings highlighted

- **The case change:**
  - BEFORE kaana: Subject (nominative) + Predicate (nominative)
  - AFTER kaana: Subject (NOMINATIVE) + Predicate (ACCUSATIVE)
  - Introduce: subject of kaana (ism kāna / اِسْمُ كَانَ) — stays nominative, and predicate of kaana (khabar kāna / خَبَرُ كَانَ) — becomes accusative
- Show before/after comparison: "ٱلْوَلَدُ ذَكِيٌّ" (al-waladu dhakiyyun) → "كَانَ ٱلْوَلَدُ ذَكِيًّا" (kāna l-waladu dhakiyyan) — note the dammatain → fathatain change on the predicate
- Contrast with inna: Inna changes SUBJECT; Kaana changes PREDICATE (comparison table)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas
- Each with i'rab analysis showing:
  - Kaana (or sister verb) — conjugated verb with tense/person
  - Subject (ism kāna) — NOMINATIVE (with reason: "subject of kaana stays nominative")
  - Predicate (khabar kāna) — ACCUSATIVE (with reason: "predicate of kaana takes accusative case")
- Show laysa (negation) as a common sister
- Contrast with plain nominal sentence to show what changed
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Kaana and her sisters are 'incomplete verbs' that enter nominal sentences and change the PREDICATE to accusative case. The subject stays nominative. Remember: Subject of kaana = NOMINATIVE (unchanged). Predicate of kaana = ACCUSATIVE (changed). Compare with inna: inna changes subject; kaana changes predicate."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't confuse which part changes — inna changes the SUBJECT, kaana changes the PREDICATE. Mix them up and your i'rab will be wrong."
  - "Kaana is a VERB that conjugates — كَانَ (kāna, past), يَكُونُ (yakūnu, present), كُنْ (kun, imperative). Don't treat it as a particle."
  - "لَيْسَ (laysa) means 'is not' — even though it's in the kaana family, it works in present tense for negation."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Find the subject and predicate of kaana — what case does each take?"
  2. Case change (beginner): "Convert this nominal sentence by adding kaana — which word's ending changes?"
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for all components of this kaana sentence"
  4. Inna vs Kaana (intermediate): "Given these verses, determine whether inna or kaana (or neither) is modifying the sentence, and explain the case assignments"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Inna and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/inna-sisters) — "The other modifier — changes subject instead"
- Previous: [Subject & Predicate](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate) — "Normal nominal sentence structure"
- Previous: [The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/nominative-case) — "Why subjects normally take nominative"
- Prepares for: Level 3 verb conjugation lessons — "Kaana conjugation patterns"
- Congratulatory note: "You've completed Level 2! You now understand Arabic's three-case system, both sentence types, possessive constructions, adjective agreement, and how inna/kaana modify sentences. Level 3 will take you into the world of Arabic morphology — roots, verb forms, and conjugation patterns."

**Critical requirements:** Full tashkeel, full transliteration, i'rab three-part format, bilingual terminology, one concept per lesson. Include inna vs kaana comparison table. Include Level 2 completion celebration and Level 3 preview.
