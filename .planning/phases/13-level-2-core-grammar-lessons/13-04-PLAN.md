<objective>
Create 2 lessons requiring both sentence structure and case knowledge: L2.06 The Genitive Case (Jarr) completing the three-case system, and L2.09 Adjective Agreement (Na't & Man'ut) which requires both subject/predicate knowledge (L2.02) and nominative case knowledge (L2.04).

Purpose: L2.06 completes the three-case system (nominative → accusative → genitive), enabling learners to perform full i'rab on any simple sentence. L2.09 teaches how adjectives mirror their nouns in all grammatical features — a key pattern for reading Quranic descriptions. L2.06 unlocks L2.07 (prepositions) and L2.08 (idafah).

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples with i'rab analysis, and 3-4 practice exercises each.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — "ٱلْحَمْدُ لِلَّهِ رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ" showing genitive after preposition and in idafah.
- Key progression: "You've mastered nominative (L2.04) and accusative (L2.05). Now let's complete the three-case system with the THIRD and final case — genitive. This case appears after prepositions and in possessive phrases."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand when nouns take genitive case (after prepositions, in possessive constructions)
  2. Recognize genitive markers: kasra, ya (dual/plural)
  3. Identify genitive functions in the Quran
- Connection: "With all three cases learned, you'll be able to analyze the grammatical role of ANY noun you encounter."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Genitive Case:**
- Plain English first: "The genitive case marks nouns that are 'connected to' or 'governed by' something else — either a preposition or another noun. Think of it as the 'belonging' or 'following' case."
- English analogy: "English uses prepositions like 'of', 'in', 'from' to show relationships: 'the book OF the student', 'IN the house'. Arabic does the same, but also puts a kasra ending on the noun to mark it as genitive."
- Introduce: [genitive case](/resources/glossary#jarr) (jarr / جَرّ)

- **Genitive markers:**
  - **Singular:** kasra (ـِ) definite / kasratain (ـٍ) indefinite
  - **Dual:** ya-nun (ـَيْنِ) — same as accusative dual
  - **Sound masculine plural:** ya-nun (ـِينَ) — same as accusative SMP
  - **Sound feminine plural:** kasra (ـَاتِ) — same as accusative SFP
- GrammarTable showing genitive markers across singular, dual, plural
- Note the merged forms: dual and sound plurals share markers with accusative

- **Two main functions that take genitive (Level 2 scope):**
  1. After prepositions (ḥurūf al-jarr / حُرُوفُ ٱلْجَرِّ) — detailed in L2.07
  2. Second noun in possessive construction (iḍāfah / إِضَافَة) — detailed in L2.08

- **Three-case system summary:**
  - GrammarTable comparing all three cases: nominative (subject/predicate), accusative (object), genitive (after preposition/in possession)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha
- Each with i'rab analysis (three-part format)
- Show examples of:
  - Genitive after a preposition (لِلَّهِ — li-llāhi, "to/for Allah")
  - Genitive in a possessive construction (رَبِّ ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ — rabbi l-ʿālamīna)
  - Contrast genitive with nominative/accusative in the same verse
- Al-Fatiha is ideal because it contains all three cases in a short, familiar text
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "The genitive case (jarr / جَرّ) marks nouns in two positions: (1) after a preposition — 'in the house', 'from the book'; (2) as the second noun in a possessive construction — 'the book OF the student'. Marked by kasra (ـِ/ـٍ). With all three cases, you can now identify any noun's function: nominative = doer/topic, accusative = receiver, genitive = after preposition/possession."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't confuse genitive kasra (ـِ) with the short vowel kasra used elsewhere — case endings appear only on the LAST consonant of a noun"
  - "In dual and sound masculine plural, genitive and accusative share the same markers (ya-based). Context tells you which case — after a preposition? It's genitive."
  - "Don't forget that genitive is the ONLY case available after prepositions — there are no exceptions at this level"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Which words are genitive in this verse from Al-Fatiha? What markers indicate it?"
  2. Three-case sorting (beginner): "Sort each noun in this verse into its case: nominative, accusative, or genitive. Explain why."
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for all nouns in this Al-Fatiha verse"
  4. Complete analysis (intermediate): "Given this verse, identify every noun's case, function, marker, and reason — a complete three-case i'rab"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [The Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/accusative-case)
- Next: [Prepositions & Genitive](/learn/level-2/prepositions-genitive) — "Deep dive into which prepositions govern genitive"
- Next: [The Possessive Construction](/learn/level-2/possessive-idafah) — "How genitive creates 'of' relationships"
- Reference: [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart)

**Critical requirements:** Full tashkeel, full transliteration, i'rab three-part format, bilingual terminology, one concept per lesson. Include a THREE-CASE SUMMARY table — this is the capstone of the case chain.

level: 2
order: 9
description: "Understand how adjectives agree with nouns in gender, number, case, and definiteness, and identify adjective-noun pairs in the Quran."
draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — "ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ" (aṣ-ṣirāṭa l-mustaqīma) "the straight path" — both noun and adjective are accusative AND definite.
- Opening: "When you describe something in English, the adjective doesn't change: 'the TALL boy', 'the TALL girl', 'the TALL boys'. Arabic is different — the adjective MUST match its noun in FOUR properties. Let's learn this essential agreement pattern."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand that adjectives must agree with nouns in gender, number, case, and definiteness
  2. Identify adjective-noun pairs in Quranic phrases
  3. Recognize word order: noun precedes adjective
- Connection: "You need [L2.02](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate) (subject/predicate — to distinguish adjectives from predicates) and [L2.04](/learn/level-2/nominative-case) (case — adjectives take the same case as their nouns)."

**Section 2 — Understanding Adjective Agreement:**
- Plain English first: "In Arabic, adjectives are 'followers' — they follow their noun and copy its properties exactly. If the noun is feminine, the adjective becomes feminine. If the noun is genitive, the adjective becomes genitive. The adjective is like a mirror."
- English analogy: "In Spanish or French, adjectives agree in gender: 'un libro bueno' vs 'una casa buena'. Arabic does this PLUS number, case, AND definiteness — four types of agreement."
- Introduce: [adjective](/resources/glossary#nat) (naʿt / نَعْت) and [described noun](/resources/glossary#manut) (manʿūt / مَنْعُوت)

- **The four agreements (GrammarTable):**
  1. **Gender:** Masculine noun → masculine adjective; Feminine noun → feminine adjective (add taa marbuta ة)
  2. **Number:** Singular → singular adjective; Dual → dual adjective; Plural → plural adjective (NOTE: broken plurals of non-human take feminine singular adjective — brief mention, not deep dive)
  3. **Case:** Nominative noun → nominative adjective; Accusative → accusative; Genitive → genitive
  4. **Definiteness:** Definite noun (with al-) → definite adjective (with al-); Indefinite → indefinite

- **Word order:** Noun FIRST, then adjective(s) — opposite of English "big book" → "kitābun kabīrun"
- **Key distinction:** Adjective vs Predicate — "ٱلْكِتَابُ كَبِيرٌ" (the book [is] big — PREDICATE, indefinite after definite) vs "ٱلْكِتَابُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ" (the big book — ADJECTIVE, both definite). This is critical for reading Arabic.
- GrammarTable showing noun-adjective pairs with all four agreements demonstrated

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha
- Each with i'rab analysis showing adjective agreement
- Show examples of:
  - Definite noun + definite adjective: "ٱلصِّرَٰطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ" (both accusative, both definite)
  - Different cases: adjective matching noun's case
  - How to tell adjective from predicate in context
- Highlight the agreement in each pair
- Word-by-word breakdown showing matching gender, number, case, definiteness
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic adjectives (naʿt) MUST agree with their noun (manʿūt) in four properties: (1) Gender — masculine/feminine, (2) Number — singular/dual/plural, (3) Case — nominative/accusative/genitive, (4) Definiteness — definite (with al-) / indefinite. The adjective always comes AFTER the noun."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't confuse adjective with predicate — both follow the noun, but an adjective matches definiteness (ٱلْكِتَابُ ٱلْكَبِيرُ = the big book) while a predicate typically doesn't (ٱلْكِتَابُ كَبِيرٌ = the book is big)"
  - "Non-human plurals take feminine SINGULAR adjective — 'the big books' = ٱلْكُتُبُ ٱلْكَبِيرَةُ (not ٱلْكَبِيرُونَ). This is a common source of errors."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Matching (beginner): "For each noun, choose the correctly agreeing adjective from the options"
  2. Identification (beginner): "Find the adjective-noun pairs in this verse and check their agreement"
  3. Adjective vs Predicate (intermediate): "Is the second word an adjective modifying the noun, or a predicate describing it? How can you tell?"
  4. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide i'rab for this adjective-noun pair — show how the adjective mirrors the noun's case"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Subject & Predicate](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate) — "Understanding predicates helps distinguish adjectives from predicates"
- Previous: [The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/nominative-case) — "Case system that adjectives follow"
- Reference: [Gender in Arabic](/learn/level-1/gender) — "Masculine/feminine basics from L1.08"
- Reference: [Singular, Dual & Plural](/learn/level-1/singular-dual-plural) — "Number system from L1.09"

**Critical requirements:** Full tashkeel, full transliteration, i'rab three-part format, bilingual terminology, one concept per lesson (PDGY-08: adjective agreement ONLY — broken plural rules get brief mention, full treatment in Level 3).
