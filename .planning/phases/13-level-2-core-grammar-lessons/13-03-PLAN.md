<objective>
Create L2.05 The Accusative Case (Nasb), the second lesson in the case system chain (L2.04 nominative → L2.05 accusative → L2.06 genitive).

Purpose: After learning when nouns take nominative case (L2.04), learners need to understand the second case — accusative. This teaches when nouns receive actions (direct objects) and other accusative functions. It unlocks L2.06 (genitive case), completing the three-case system.

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples with i'rab analysis, and 3-4 practice exercises.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — e.g., "قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ" or another verse showing accusative nouns.
- Key progression: "In [L2.04](/learn/level-2/nominative-case), you mastered the nominative case for subjects and predicates. Now let's learn the SECOND case — the accusative. When a noun RECEIVES the action, or describes the circumstances, it takes accusative case."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand when nouns take accusative case (direct objects, circumstances)
  2. Recognize accusative markers: fatha, alif (dual), kasra (sound feminine plural)
  3. Identify objects and other accusative functions in Quranic verses
- Connection: "Nominative marks the DOER. Accusative marks the RECEIVER. Together with genitive (next lesson), they form the complete case system."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Accusative Case:**
- Plain English first: "If nominative is for the 'doer', accusative is for the 'receiver' — the thing being acted upon. 'He READ THE BOOK' — 'the book' is the receiver of reading. In Arabic, receivers get a fatha (ـَ) or fathatain (ـً) ending."
- English analogy: "English pronouns change for objects: 'SHE helped HIM' (not 'HE'). Arabic does this for ALL nouns — and instead of changing the whole word, it changes just the ending."
- Introduce: [accusative case](/resources/glossary#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْب)

- **Accusative markers:**
  - **Singular:** fatha (ـَ) definite / fathatain (ـً) indefinite
  - **Dual:** ya-nun (ـَيْنِ)
  - **Sound masculine plural:** ya-nun (ـِينَ)
  - **Sound feminine plural:** kasra (ـَاتِ) — note: same marker as genitive for this form
- GrammarTable showing all accusative markers across singular, dual, plural

- **Key functions that take accusative case (Level 2 scope):**
  1. Direct object (mafʿūl bih / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ) — the receiver of the verb's action
  2. Subject of inna and her sisters (ism inna) — preview, detailed in L2.10
  3. Predicate of kaana and her sisters (khabar kaana) — preview, detailed in L2.11
  4. Adverbial nouns of time/place (ẓarf / ظَرْف) — brief mention
- Note: Many more accusative functions exist (Level 4 content) — keep focused on direct objects primarily

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq
- Each with detailed i'rab analysis using three-part format
- Show examples of:
  - Direct object after a verb (mafʿūl bih)
  - Contrast with nominative subject in the same verse (show both cases)
  - Indefinite accusative with fathatain and alif (ـًا ending)
- Pattern: "Verb + Subject (nominative) + Object (ACCUSATIVE)"
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "The accusative case (naṣb / نَصْب) marks the receiver of an action. Its primary function: direct object (mafʿūl bih) — the noun that receives the verb's action. Marked by fatha (ـَ/ـً) on singular nouns. To identify: ask 'What is being acted upon?' — that noun is accusative."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't confuse accusative fatha (ـَ) with the short vowel fatha used elsewhere — case endings appear only on the LAST letter of a noun"
  - "Don't assume every noun after a verb is accusative — the first noun after a verb is typically the subject (nominative/fāʿil), not the object"
  - "Indefinite accusative nouns often get an extra alif: كِتَابًا (kitāban) — this alif is a spelling convention, not a letter"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Which words are accusative in this verse? What markers indicate it?"
  2. Function (beginner): "Why is this noun accusative? What function does it serve?"
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for all nouns — identify nominative subjects and accusative objects"
  4. Contrast (intermediate): "In this verse, identify the subject (nominative) and object (accusative). Explain how you can tell them apart."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/nominative-case)
- Next: [The Genitive Case](/learn/level-2/genitive-case) — "The third and final case"
- Related: [The Verbal Sentence](/learn/level-2/verbal-sentence) — "Where you learned about verb-subject-object structure"
- Prepares for: [Inna and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/inna-sisters) — "Particles that put subjects in accusative"
- Reference: [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart)

**Critical requirements:** Full tashkeel, full transliteration, i'rab three-part format, bilingual terminology, one concept per lesson (PDGY-08: accusative case ONLY — don't deep-dive into inna/kaana).

- Contrasts accusative with nominative (builds on L2.04)
- References Al-Falaq examples per CURRICULUM_MAP.md
- Forward references L2.06 (genitive) and L2.10 (inna sisters)
