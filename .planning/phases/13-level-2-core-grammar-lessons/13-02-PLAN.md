<objective>
Create 2 sentence structure lessons that build on L2.01: L2.02 Subject & Predicate (deep dive into mubtadaʾ/khabar types and agreement) and L2.03 The Verbal Sentence (Jumlah Fi'liyyah).

Purpose: L2.02 deepens the nominal sentence understanding by examining different types of subjects and predicates, their agreement rules, and how to analyze them. L2.03 completes the sentence type pair by teaching verbal sentence structure, enabling learners to analyze ANY Arabic sentence. Together they unlock L2.09 (adjective agreement), L2.10 (inna sisters), and L2.11 (kaana sisters).

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples with i'rab analysis, and 3-4 practice exercises each.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — e.g., "إِنَّ ٱلْإِنسَانَ لَفِى خُسْرٍ" or another verse showing subject-predicate structure.
- Opening: "In [L2.01](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence), you learned that nominal sentences have two parts: subject (mubtadaʾ) and predicate (khabar). But what types of words can BE the subject? What forms can the predicate take? Let's explore these deeply."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Identify the mubtadaʾ (subject) and khabar (predicate) in nominal sentences
  2. Understand that both typically take nominative case
  3. Analyze complete nominal sentences from Quranic examples
- Connection: Builds directly on L2.01 nominal sentence foundation

**Section 2 — Understanding Subject & Predicate:**
- Plain English first: "The subject is what you're TALKING ABOUT, and the predicate is what you're SAYING about it. It's like a topic-comment structure: 'As for the book — it is big.'"
- English analogy: "In English, the subject is usually one word or phrase ('The tall boy'). The predicate is everything else ('runs very fast'). Arabic works similarly, but with more flexibility in predicate types."

- **Subject (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) — Deep Dive:**
  - Usually definite (name, pronoun, or noun with al-)
  - Typically first word in the sentence
  - Always takes nominative case (rafʿ)
  - Can be a pronoun (explicit or implied)
  - GrammarTable: types of subjects with examples

- **Predicate (khabar / خَبَر) — Deep Dive:**
  - Three types of predicates:
    1. Single word (khabar mufrad): "ٱللَّهُ كَرِيمٌ" — Allah [is] generous
    2. Phrase/sentence (khabar jumlah): prepositional phrase, verbal sentence as predicate
    3. Semi-sentence (khabar shibh jumlah): "ٱلْكِتَابُ عَلَى ٱلطَّاوِلَةِ" — The book [is] on the table
  - Takes nominative case when it's a single word
  - GrammarTable: predicate types with examples

- **Agreement rules:** Predicate agrees with subject in gender and number (brief — PDGY-08, don't over-explain)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr
- Each with detailed i'rab analysis using three-part format
- Show different predicate types in Quranic examples
- Identify subject and predicate in each, with case analysis
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "In a nominal sentence: (1) The subject (mubtadaʾ) is what you're talking about — usually definite, always nominative. (2) The predicate (khabar) is what you're saying about it — can be a single word, phrase, or sentence. When a single word, it takes nominative case and agrees with the subject in gender and number."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't assume the predicate is always a single adjective — it can be a whole prepositional phrase or even another sentence"
  - "Indefinite subjects are possible but rare — focus on definite subjects for now"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Find the mubtadaʾ and khabar in these nominal sentences"
  2. Classification (beginner): "What type of predicate is used — single word, phrase, or sentence?"
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide complete i'rab for the subject and predicate"
  4. Construction (intermediate): "Given this subject, write an appropriate predicate (choose the type)"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence)
- Next: [The Verbal Sentence](/learn/level-2/verbal-sentence)
- Prepares for: [Adjective Agreement](/learn/level-2/adjective-agreement), [Inna and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/inna-sisters), [Kaana and Her Sisters](/learn/level-2/kaana-sisters)

level: 2
order: 3
description: "Define verbal sentences, understand verb-subject-object word order, and identify them in Quranic verses."

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar (CURRICULUM_MAP.md designated surah) — "إِنَّا أَعْطَيْنَاكَ ٱلْكَوْثَرَ" (innā aʿṭaynāka l-kawthara) "Indeed, We have granted you al-Kawthar" — showing a clear verbal sentence with verb, subject, and object.
- Opening: "You've learned the nominal sentence (L2.01/L2.02) — starting with a noun and describing a state. Now let's learn the OTHER sentence type: the verbal sentence, which starts with a verb and describes an ACTION."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Define a verbal sentence as beginning with a verb
  2. Understand verb-subject-object word order
  3. Identify verbal sentences in the Quran
- Connection: Contrasts with nominal sentence (L2.01) — "Two sentence types, two structures"

**Section 2 — Understanding the Verbal Sentence:**
- Plain English first: "A verbal sentence begins with a VERB — an action word. It tells you what happened, is happening, or will happen. 'He said', 'They believed', 'We created' — all start with verbs."
- English analogy: "English usually puts subject first: 'The student read the book.' Arabic verbal sentences put the verb first: 'Read the student the book.' This verb-first order is the DEFAULT in Arabic."
- Introduce Arabic terminology: [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة)

- **Three essential components:**
  1. [Verb](/resources/glossary#fil) (fiʿl / فِعْل) — the action
  2. [Subject/Doer](/resources/glossary#fail) (fāʿil / فَاعِل) — who does it (nominative case)
  3. [Object](/resources/glossary#maful-bih) (mafʿūl bih / مَفْعُولٌ بِهِ) — who/what receives the action (accusative case, detailed in L2.05)

- **Word order:** Verb → Subject → Object (VSO) — the default Arabic order
- Note: Sometimes the subject is HIDDEN inside the verb conjugation (embedded pronoun)
- GrammarTable: verbal sentence structure with 3-4 examples showing verb, subject, object
- Brief contrast with nominal sentence structure using a comparison table

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar
- Each with i'rab analysis using three-part format
- Show examples of:
  - Verb + explicit subject (fāʿil is a separate noun)
  - Verb with embedded subject (fāʿil is a pronoun hidden in the verb)
  - Verb + subject + object
- Identify each component and its case
- Note: For verbs, state tense and person instead of case (verbs don't take case endings)
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "A verbal sentence (jumlah fiʿliyyah) starts with a verb. Standard word order: Verb (fiʿl) + Subject/Doer (fāʿil — nominative) + Object (mafʿūl bih — accusative). The subject can be an explicit noun OR embedded in the verb conjugation. To identify: look at the FIRST word — if it's a verb, it's a verbal sentence."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes:
  - "Don't assume every sentence with a verb is a verbal sentence — it must START with a verb. If a noun comes first, it's still nominal even if a verb appears later."
  - "Don't confuse fāʿil (doer/subject) with mafʿūl bih (object) — the doer comes right after the verb and takes nominative case."
  - "Don't forget embedded subjects — when you see a conjugated verb with no explicit noun after it, the subject is built into the verb form (you'll learn verb conjugation in Level 3)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Classification (beginner): "Is this a nominal or verbal sentence? How can you tell?"
  2. Identification (beginner): "Find the verb, subject, and object in this verbal sentence"
  3. I'rab (intermediate): "Provide i'rab for the subject and object — what case does each take and why?"
  4. Contrast (intermediate): "Rewrite this nominal sentence as a verbal sentence (or vice versa) — how does the structure change?"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence), [Subject & Predicate](/learn/level-2/subject-predicate)
- Next: [The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/nominative-case) — "Learn why the fāʿil takes nominative"
- Prepares for: Level 3 verb conjugation lessons
- Reference: [Verb Conjugation Tables](/resources/verb-tables)
