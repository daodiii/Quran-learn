<objective>
Create L3.10 Verb Form II (Taf'il) and L3.11 Verb Form III (Mufa'alah) — the first two derived verb forms. These teach the critical concept of how Arabic modifies Form I to create new meanings: Form II doubles the middle letter for causative/intensive, Form III adds alif for reciprocal/attempted action.

Purpose: Forms II and III are the most common derived forms in the Quran. Teaching them together shows students the pattern of "Form I + modification = new meaning." This establishes the framework for all subsequent verb form lessons (IV-X).

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files, each with Form I → derived form comparison, semantic shift explanation, representative conjugation (6-8 persons, not full 14), and Quranic examples.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "'allama" — He taught) — e.g., "وَعَلَّمَ آدَمَ ٱلْأَسْمَاءَ كُلَّهَا" [Al-Baqarah 2:31]. Highlight عَلَّمَ and show the shadda marking Form II.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Recognize Form II pattern (faʿʿala) with doubled middle letter
  2. Understand Form II meanings: causative, intensive, transitive
  3. Identify Form II verbs in the Quran
- Connection: "In [L3.02](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you learned Form I — the base verb. Form II is the first DERIVED form. It takes a Form I verb and doubles its middle consonant to change the meaning."

**Section 2 — Understanding Form II:**
- Plain English: "Form II takes a base verb and makes it more powerful: it can make the action causative ('he knew' → 'he taught'), intensive ('he broke' → 'he shattered'), or transitive ('it was clear' → 'he made clear')."
- **CRITICAL — show semantic shift clearly (14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 3):**
  - Form I عَلِمَ (ʿalima) "he knew" → Form II عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) "he taught" (CAUSED to know)
  - Form I فَهِمَ (fahima) "he understood" → Form II فَهَّمَ (fahhama) "he explained" (CAUSED to understand)
  - Form I كَسَرَ (kasara) "he broke" → Form II كَسَّرَ (kassara) "he shattered" (INTENSIVE breaking)
  - Form I نَزَلَ (nazala) "he descended" → Form II نَزَّلَ (nazzala) "he sent down" (CAUSED to descend)
- Pattern template: فَعَّلَ (faʿʿala) — doubled middle letter (shadda on ع position)
- Visual decomposition (14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 1):
  ```
  Root: ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
  Form I pattern: فَعِلَ → عَلِمَ "he knew"
  Form II pattern: فَعَّلَ → عَلَّمَ "he taught"
  The doubled ل (with shadda) is the Form II marker
  ```
- GrammarTable comparing Form I and Form II for 4 roots
- VerbConjugation with REPRESENTATIVE forms (6-8 persons: he, she, they m, you m, you f, I, we) — NOT full 14. Note: "Full conjugation follows the same suffix pattern as Form I (L3.03). Only the stem changes."

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah
- Each with MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab: Root + Form II identification + semantic shift from Form I
- Show the shadda as the form marker in each example
- At least one verse where Form I and Form II of same root appear nearby (if available)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form II (faʿʿala / فَعَّلَ) doubles the middle root letter. Three common meanings: (1) Causative — makes someone do the base action, (2) Intensive — does the base action intensely or repeatedly, (3) Transitive — makes an intransitive Form I into a transitive verb."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't confuse Form II's shadda with a normal shadda — look for it SPECIFICALLY on the middle root letter"
  - "Don't assume all Form II verbs are causative — check context. Some are intensive or denominative (from nouns)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Form identification (beginner): "Is this Form I or Form II? عَلِمَ / عَلَّمَ / كَتَبَ / كَسَّرَ"
  2. Semantic shift (beginner): "Form I نَزَلَ means 'he descended.' What does Form II نَزَّلَ mean? Explain the semantic shift."
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Identify the Form II verb in this Al-Baqarah verse. Extract the root, explain the Form II marker, and describe the meaning shift from Form I."
  4. Root derivation (intermediate): "Given root ق-د-س (q-d-s) meaning 'holy/sacred', predict what Form II قَدَّسَ (qaddasa) might mean."

title: "Verb Form III (Mufa'alah)"
level: 3
order: 11
description: "Recognize Form III verbs with alif after the first root letter and understand their reciprocal and attempted-action meanings."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Mumtahanah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) — find a Form III verb. E.g., قَاتَلَ (qātala) "he fought" from root ق-ت-ل, or جَاهَدَ (jāhada) "he strove" from relevant context.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Recognize Form III pattern (fāʿala) with alif after first letter
  2. Understand Form III meaning: attempting an action toward someone (reciprocal)
  3. Identify Form III verbs in Quranic context
- Connection: "Like Form II, Form III modifies Form I. But instead of doubling the middle letter, Form III inserts an alif (ا) after the first root letter. This creates a reciprocal meaning — the action is directed toward someone."

**Section 2 — Understanding Form III:**
- Plain English: "Form III means doing an action TO or WITH someone. If Form I is just 'doing,' Form III is 'doing it with/against someone.' Think of it as making the action interactive."
- Semantic shift examples:
  - Form I قَتَلَ (qatala) "he killed" → Form III قَاتَلَ (qātala) "he fought (against)" — directed action
  - Form I كَتَبَ (kataba) "he wrote" → Form III كَاتَبَ (kātaba) "he corresponded with" — mutual action
  - Form I سَبَقَ (sabaqa) "he preceded" → Form III سَابَقَ (sābaqa) "he raced (with)" — competitive action
  - Form I جَلَسَ (jalasa) "he sat" → Form III جَالَسَ (jālasa) "he sat with" — companionship
- Pattern template: فَاعَلَ (fāʿala) — alif inserted after first root letter
- Visual decomposition:
  ```
  Root: ق-ت-ل (q-t-l) "killing"
  Form I: فَعَلَ → قَتَلَ "he killed"
  Form III: فَاعَلَ → قَاتَلَ "he fought"
  The alif after ق (first root letter) is the Form III marker
  ```
- GrammarTable comparing Form I and Form III for 4 roots
- VerbConjugation with representative forms (6-8 persons)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Mumtahanah (or relevant surahs)
- Each with morphological i'rab showing Form III identification
- Semantic shift explanation for each

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form III (fāʿala / فَاعَلَ) inserts alif after the first root letter. Main meanings: (1) Reciprocal — doing the action WITH or AGAINST someone, (2) Attempted action — trying to do the action, (3) Competitive — doing the action in competition."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't confuse Form III's alif with the alif in regular active participle pattern (fāʿil) — context and voweling differ"
  - "Form III often requires a preposition to indicate the other party: قَاتَلَ + مَعَ (fought with)"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Form identification (beginner): "Is this Form I or Form III? كَتَبَ / كَاتَبَ / نَصَرَ / نَاصَرَ"
  2. Semantic shift (beginner): "Form I سَبَقَ means 'he preceded.' What does Form III سَابَقَ mean?"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): Form III identification in verse
  4. Compare Forms (intermediate): "Compare Form II عَلَّمَ and Form III عَالَمَ (if exists) — or explain why some roots have Form II but not Form III"
