<objective>
Create L3.13 Verb Form V (Tafa''ul) and L3.14 Verb Form VI (Tafa'ul) — the reflexive counterparts of Forms II and III. These are taught together to highlight the systematic pattern: Form II+تَ prefix = Form V, Form III+تَ prefix = Form VI.

Purpose: Forms V and VI demonstrate that the Arabic verb form system is SYSTEMATIC, not random. Once students see that adding تَ to Form II creates Form V (reflexive), and adding تَ to Form III creates Form VI (mutual reflexive), they gain confidence in the entire system.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files, each showing the derivation relationship to its parent form (II→V, III→VI).

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Muzzammil (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "tatanazzalu") — find a Form V verb. تَنَزَّلَ (tanazzala) from root ن-ز-ل means "to descend gradually" — the reflexive of Form II نَزَّلَ "to send down."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Recognize Form V pattern (tafaʿʿala) as reflexive of Form II
  2. Understand Form V meaning: reflexive or pretending
  3. Identify Form V verbs in Quranic verses
- Connection: "In [L3.10](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii), you learned Form II (faʿʿala) with the doubled middle letter. Form V simply adds تَ prefix to Form II: فَعَّلَ → تَفَعَّلَ. The تَ makes the action reflexive — directed back at the doer."

**Section 2 — Understanding Form V:**
- Plain English: "Form V takes Form II's causative/intensive meaning and turns it inward. If Form II means 'he taught (someone),' Form V means 'he learned (taught himself).' If Form II means 'he broke (something),' Form V means 'it broke apart (by itself).'"
- **Key relationship: Form V = تَ + Form II**
  - Form II عَلَّمَ (ʿallama) "he taught" → Form V تَعَلَّمَ (taʿallama) "he learned" (taught himself)
  - Form II كَلَّمَ (kallama) "he spoke to" → Form V تَكَلَّمَ (takallama) "he spoke" (reflexive)
  - Form II وَضَّأَ (waḍḍaʾa) "he washed someone" → Form V تَوَضَّأَ (tawaḍḍaʾa) "he performed ablution" (washed himself)
  - Form II كَسَّرَ (kassara) "he shattered" → Form V تَكَسَّرَ (takassara) "it shattered" (broke apart by itself)
- Pattern template: تَفَعَّلَ (tafaʿʿala) — تَ prefix + doubled middle letter (inherited from Form II)
- Visual decomposition:
  ```
  Root: ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) "knowledge"
  Form I: عَلِمَ "he knew"
  Form II: عَلَّمَ "he taught" (caused to know)
  Form V: تَعَلَّمَ "he learned" (reflexive of teaching = taught himself)
  ```
- GrammarTable: Form I → Form II → Form V progression for 3-4 roots
- VerbConjugation: representative forms (6-8 persons)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Muzzammil or relevant surahs
- Morphological i'rab with Form V identification

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form V (tafaʿʿala / تَفَعَّلَ) = تَ prefix + Form II pattern. Meanings: (1) Reflexive of Form II — action directed at self, (2) Gradual process — action happens slowly, (3) Pretending — acting as if (less common). To identify: look for تَ prefix + doubled middle letter."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't confuse Form V's تَ prefix with the present tense تَ prefix — Form V has تَ in PAST tense too"
  - "In present tense, Form V becomes يَتَفَعَّلُ — the يَ is the present prefix, the تَ is the Form V marker"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Form relationship (beginner): "Given Form II فَرَّقَ 'he separated (something)', what does Form V تَفَرَّقَ mean?"
  2. Identification (beginner): "Is this Form II or Form V? عَلَّمَ / تَعَلَّمَ / كَلَّمَ / تَكَلَّمَ"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): Form V identification in verse
  4. Derivation chain (intermediate): "Trace the derivation: Form I عَلِمَ → Form II ??? → Form V ???. Explain the meaning shift at each step."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** L3.10 (Form II), L3.14 (Form VI), L3.15 (Forms VII-X)

level: 3
order: 14
description: "Recognize Form VI as the reflexive of Form III and understand its meanings of mutual action and pretending."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Hujurat (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "tanabayu" — calling each other). Find a Form VI verb — e.g., تَنَابَزُوا (tanābazū) "they call each other by nicknames" [Al-Hujurat 49:11] or تَعَاوَنُوا (taʿāwanū) "cooperate with each other" [Al-Ma'idah 5:2 if needed].
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Recognize Form VI pattern (tafāʿala) as reflexive of Form III
  2. Understand Form VI meaning: mutual action or pretending
  3. Identify Form VI verbs in the Quran
- Connection: "Just as Form V adds تَ to Form II, Form VI adds تَ to Form III. Form III = doing something TO someone. Form VI = doing it TO EACH OTHER."

**Section 2 — Understanding Form VI:**
- Plain English: "Form VI means doing something MUTUALLY or TOGETHER. If Form III is 'he fought (against someone),' Form VI is 'they fought each other.' It's the 'each other' form."
- **Key relationship: Form VI = تَ + Form III**
  - Form III قَاتَلَ (qātala) "he fought against" → Form VI تَقَاتَلَ (taqātala) "they fought each other"
  - Form III سَاعَدَ (sāʿada) "he helped" → Form VI تَسَاعَدَ (tasāʿada) "they helped each other"
  - Form III بَاعَدَ (bāʿada) "he distanced" → Form VI تَبَاعَدَ (tabāʿada) "they became distant from each other"
  - Form III نَاصَرَ (nāṣara) "he supported" → Form VI تَنَاصَرَ (tanāṣara) "they supported each other"
- Pattern template: تَفَاعَلَ (tafāʿala) — تَ prefix + alif after first root letter (inherited from Form III)
- Visual decomposition showing Form I → Form III → Form VI
- GrammarTable comparing Form III and Form VI for 4 roots
- VerbConjugation: representative forms (6-8 persons)
- Second meaning: "pretending" — تَمَارَضَ (tamāraḍa) "he pretended to be sick" from root م-ر-ض

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Hujurat or relevant surahs
- Morphological i'rab with Form VI identification

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form VI (tafāʿala / تَفَاعَلَ) = تَ prefix + Form III pattern. Meanings: (1) Mutual/reciprocal — doing the action to each other, (2) Pretending — acting as if. To identify: look for تَ prefix + alif after first root letter."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't confuse Form V (تَفَعَّلَ with doubled middle) with Form VI (تَفَاعَلَ with alif) — both have تَ prefix but different internal structures"
  - "Form VI often appears in plural forms since mutual action involves multiple actors"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Form relationship (beginner): "Given Form III نَاصَرَ 'he supported,' what does Form VI تَنَاصَرَ mean?"
  2. Form V vs VI (beginner): "Is this Form V or Form VI? تَعَلَّمَ / تَقَاتَلَ / تَكَسَّرَ / تَبَاعَدَ"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): Form VI identification
  4. System overview (intermediate): "Show the Form I → III → VI chain for root ع-و-ن 'help.' Explain the meaning at each level."
