<objective>
Create L3.03 Past Tense Conjugation (al-Madi) and L3.04 Present Tense Conjugation (al-Mudari') — the two core conjugation lessons that teach the complete 14-person paradigm for Form I verbs. These are reference-grade lessons that all subsequent verb form lessons will build on.

Purpose: Conjugation is the mechanical skill that unlocks verb recognition in Quranic text. Past tense suffixes and present tense prefixes are the DNA of Arabic verb identification. Students who master these 28 forms (14 past + 14 present) can decode any Form I verb they encounter.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files, each with full 14-person VerbConjugation table, Quranic examples with morphological analysis, and conjugation practice exercises.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "a'tayna" — we gave) — show أَعْطَيْنَاكَ [Al-Kawthar 108:1]. Note: أَعْطَيْنَاكَ is actually Form IV, so if using Al-Kawthar, either find a Form I verb or explain the conjugation pattern applies across forms. Alternatively, find a clear Form I past tense from Al-Kawthar or nearby short surahs.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn all 14 past tense conjugations
  2. Recognize past tense suffixes attached to verb roots
  3. Conjugate simple Form I verbs in past tense
- Connection: "In [L3.02](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i), you learned the Form I pattern فَعَلَ. That's actually the 'he did' form — third person masculine singular past tense. Now let's learn ALL 14 conjugations."
- Pronoun suffix preview: "Each conjugation adds a suffix to tell you WHO performed the action. These suffixes are related to the pronouns you'll study in depth in [L3.06](/learn/level-3/subject-pronouns)."

**Section 2 — Understanding Past Tense Conjugation:**
- Plain English first: "Past tense in Arabic is formed by adding suffixes to the verb stem. The stem stays the same — only the ending changes to show WHO did the action."
- Analogy: "English does something similar but simpler: 'I played, you played, he played, they played' — English barely changes. Arabic is more precise: each person gets a unique suffix, so you always know EXACTLY who acted, even without a pronoun."
- Arabic terminology: [past tense](/resources/glossary#madi) (al-māḍī / المَاضِي) — literally "the one that passed"
- **VerbConjugation component — FULL 14-person paradigm using root ك-ت-ب (kataba "he wrote"):**
  Show all 14 persons in order:
  - 3rd person: هُوَ كَتَبَ / هِيَ كَتَبَتْ / هُمَا كَتَبَا / هُمَا كَتَبَتَا / هُمْ كَتَبُوا / هُنَّ كَتَبْنَ
  - 2nd person: أَنْتَ كَتَبْتَ / أَنْتِ كَتَبْتِ / أَنْتُمَا كَتَبْتُمَا / أَنْتُمْ كَتَبْتُمْ / أَنْتُنَّ كَتَبْتُنَّ
  - 1st person: أَنَا كَتَبْتُ / نَحْنُ كَتَبْنَا
  Each with transliteration and translation.
- GrammarTable summarizing the suffix patterns: -a (he), -at (she), -ā (they dual m), -atā (they dual f), -ū (they m), -na (they f), -ta (you m), -ti (you f), -tumā (you dual), -tum (you pl m), -tunna (you pl f), -tu (I), -nā (we)
- Key insight: "The suffixes fall into two groups: (1) Third-person suffixes modify the END of the verb. (2) First/second-person suffixes all start with تَ and have a sukūn on the second root letter."

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar and other short surahs showing different past tense conjugations
- Show different persons in Quranic context:
  - 3rd person singular examples (most common in Quran)
  - 1st person plural ("we" — common in divine speech)
  - 2nd person singular (addresses to Prophet or reader)
- Each with MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab: Root + Pattern + Form + conjugation person
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse (PDGY-07)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Past tense conjugation rules with suffix table
- Callout type="warning" (Common Mistakes):
  - "Don't confuse the 'they feminine' suffix -نَ with the present tense 'they feminine' — context and vowel patterns differ"
  - "Don't forget the sukūn: in 1st/2nd person forms, the middle root letter takes sukūn (كَتَبْتُ not كَتَبَتُ)"
  - "Don't mix up هُمَا كَتَبَا (they dual masc past) with similar-looking forms"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Suffix identification (beginner): "What person is each of these conjugations? كَتَبَتْ / كَتَبُوا / كَتَبْنَا"
  2. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate the verb نَصَرَ (naṣara 'he helped') for: she, you (m), we"
  3. Quranic identification (intermediate): "Find the past tense verbs in this verse. For each, identify the root, form, and person."
  4. Full analysis (intermediate): "Provide complete morphological analysis for the underlined verbs in these verses."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** Links to L3.02, L3.04, L3.06, verb-forms-chart resource

**Critical requirements:**
- VerbConjugation component with FULL 14-person paradigm (this is the reference table)
- All Arabic fully vocalized
- Partial transliteration (familiar pronouns can be Arabic-only in prose)
- Morphological i'rab with conjugation analysis

draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "na'budu, nasta'in") — "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ" [Al-Fatiha 1:5]. Both نَعْبُدُ and نَسْتَعِينُ are present tense — the نَ prefix means "we."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn all 14 present tense conjugations with prefixes and suffixes
  2. Understand indicative mood (marfu') as the default present
  3. Conjugate Form I verbs in present tense
- Connection: "In [L3.03](/learn/level-3/past-tense), you learned past tense with suffixes only. Present tense is different — it uses PREFIXES (at the start) AND sometimes suffixes (at the end) to mark the person."

**Section 2 — Understanding Present Tense Conjugation:**
- Plain English first: "Present tense in Arabic uses four prefix letters: أَ (I), نَ (we), يَ (he/they), تَ (you/she). These tell you WHO is doing the action. Some forms also add a suffix for further distinction."
- The four prefix letters mnemonic: أَنَيْتَ (anayta) — "I/we/he/you" — a word-like combination to remember أ-ن-ي-ت
- Arabic terminology: [present tense](/resources/glossary#mudari) (al-muḍāriʿ / المُضَارِع); [indicative mood](/resources/glossary#marfu) (marfūʿ / مَرْفُوع)
- **VerbConjugation component — FULL 14-person paradigm using root ك-ت-ب (yaktubu "he writes"):**
  Show all 14 persons with prefixes and suffixes:
  - يَكْتُبُ (he), تَكْتُبُ (she), يَكْتُبَانِ (they dual m), تَكْتُبَانِ (they dual f), يَكْتُبُونَ (they m), يَكْتُبْنَ (they f)
  - تَكْتُبُ (you m), تَكْتُبِينَ (you f), تَكْتُبَانِ (you dual), تَكْتُبُونَ (you pl m), تَكْتُبْنَ (you pl f)
  - أَكْتُبُ (I), نَكْتُبُ (we)
  Each with transliteration and translation.
- GrammarTable showing prefix+suffix patterns
- Key insight: "Present tense is the 'marked' tense — indicative mood (marfūʿ) is shown by damma on the final letter. This is the DEFAULT mood. Subjunctive and jussive moods (Level 4) change this ending."
- Compare past vs present side by side for 4-5 persons

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha showing present tense verbs
- Different persons: نَعْبُدُ (we worship), نَسْتَعِينُ (we seek help), etc.
- Each with MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab: prefix identification, root extraction, form check
- Contrast with past tense from same root when possible
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse (PDGY-07)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Present tense prefix system + indicative damma ending
- Callout type="warning": Common Mistakes:
  - "Don't confuse تَكْتُبُ 'she writes' with تَكْتُبُ 'you (m) write' — they're identical in writing! Context tells you which."
  - "Don't forget the indicative damma — the default final vowel is ـُ (damma). If you see fatha or sukun on the final letter, it's subjunctive or jussive (Level 4)."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Prefix identification (beginner): "What person and gender is each? يَكْتُبُ / تَكْتُبِينَ / نَكْتُبُ / أَكْتُبُ"
  2. Conjugation (beginner): "Conjugate نَصَرَ → يَنْصُرُ for: she, they (m pl), I"
  3. Past vs present (intermediate): "Convert these past tense verbs to present tense: كَتَبَ → ?, ذَهَبَ → ?, عَلِمَ → ?"
  4. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find all present tense verbs in Al-Fatiha. For each, identify the root, person, and mood."

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:** Links to L3.03, L3.05, L3.06, verb-forms-chart

**Critical requirements:**
- VerbConjugation component with FULL 14-person paradigm
- Side-by-side past/present comparison
- All Arabic fully vocalized
- Partial transliteration
- Indicative mood (marfu') explained as default — subjunctive/jussive deferred to Level 4
