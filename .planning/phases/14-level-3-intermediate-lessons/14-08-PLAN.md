<objective>
Create L3.07 Attached Pronouns, L3.08 Demonstrative Pronouns, and L3.09 Relative Pronouns — completing the Level 3 pronoun system. These three lessons build sequentially (attached needs independent knowledge, demonstrative needs pronoun foundations, relative needs demonstrative knowledge).

Purpose: Pronouns are among the most frequent words in the Quran. Understanding attached pronouns unlocks possessive constructions (كِتَابُهُ "his book") and object marking (رَأَيْتُهُ "I saw him"). Demonstratives (ذَٰلِكَ "that") and relatives (ٱلَّذِينَ "those who") appear in virtually every Quranic page. Together these three lessons give students the tools to parse complex pronoun-heavy Quranic passages.

Output: 3 complete MDX lesson files with comprehensive pronoun charts, function explanations, and Quranic examples.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah An-Nas (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "rabbika, rabbihi") — e.g., "قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلنَّاسِ" [An-Nas 114:1]. In this surah, رَبِّ uses attached construct, and later verses show رَبِّكَ (your Lord) and similar attached pronouns.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn possessive suffixes attached to nouns
  2. Learn object suffixes attached to verbs and prepositions
  3. Distinguish between different attached pronoun forms
- Connection: "In [L3.06](/learn/level-3/subject-pronouns), you learned INDEPENDENT pronouns that stand alone: هُوَ, أَنَا, etc. Now learn ATTACHED pronouns — suffixes that glue onto nouns, verbs, and prepositions."

**Section 2 — Understanding Attached Pronouns:**
- Plain English: "Attached pronouns are like English possessive endings: 'my book,' 'his car.' But Arabic attaches them more broadly: on nouns (possession), on verbs (object), and on prepositions (object of preposition)."
- **KEY DISTINCTION (14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4):**
  - Independent pronouns = standalone words (أَنَا, هُوَ)
  - Attached pronouns = suffixes glued to other words (-ي, -هُ, -كَ)
- GrammarTable showing all attached pronoun suffixes:
  - 1st person: -ي (my/me), -نَا (our/us)
  - 2nd person: -كَ (your m sg), -كِ (your f sg), -كُمَا (your dual), -كُمْ (your m pl), -كُنَّ (your f pl)
  - 3rd person: -هُ (his/him), -هَا (her), -هُمَا (their dual), -هُمْ (their m), -هُنَّ (their f)
- Three attachment contexts with examples:
  1. **On nouns (possession):** كِتَاب + ـهُ = كِتَابُهُ "his book"
  2. **On verbs (object):** رَأَى + ـهُ = رَآهُ "he saw him"
  3. **On prepositions:** لِ + ـهُ = لَهُ "for him", مِنْ + ـهُمْ = مِنْهُمْ "from them"
- GrammarTable showing the same root word with different attached pronouns: كِتَابِي, كِتَابُكَ, كِتَابُهُ, كِتَابُنَا, etc.

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah An-Nas showing attached pronouns
- Show possessive, object, and prepositional uses
- Morphological i'rab for each

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Three contexts for attached pronouns
- Callout type="warning":
  - "When attached to verbs, don't confuse object suffixes with conjugation suffixes — كَتَبْتُهُ (I wrote it): -تُ is conjugation (I), -هُ is object (it)"
  - "Attached -ي changes the preceding vowel: كِتَابٌ → كِتَابِي (the tanween drops and kasra appears)"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Suffix identification (beginner): "What does each suffix mean? كِتَابُهُ / كِتَابِي / كِتَابُنَا"
  2. Attachment (beginner): "Attach the pronoun -هُمْ to: كِتَاب, رَأَى, مِنْ"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Identify all attached pronouns in these An-Nas verses. State the base word and pronoun meaning."
  4. Independent vs attached (intermediate): "In هُوَ يُحِبُّهَا, identify the independent pronoun and the attached pronoun. Explain their different functions."

draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "dhalika al-kitab") — "ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ" [Al-Baqarah 2:2]. ذَٰلِكَ is a demonstrative pronoun meaning "that."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn near and far demonstratives (hadha, dhalika, etc.)
  2. Understand gender and number agreement for demonstratives
  3. Identify demonstrative pronouns in the Quran

**Section 2 — Understanding Demonstrative Pronouns:**
- Plain English: "Demonstratives are pointing words: 'this' (near) and 'that' (far). Arabic has more forms because it distinguishes gender and number."
- GrammarTable showing demonstrative pronouns:
  - Near: هَٰذَا (this m), هَٰذِهِ (this f), هَٰذَانِ (these two m), هَاتَانِ (these two f), هَٰؤُلَاءِ (these)
  - Far: ذَٰلِكَ (that m), تِلْكَ (that f), ذَانِكَ (those two m), تَانِكَ (those two f), أُولَٰئِكَ (those)
- Agreement rules: demonstrative agrees with noun in gender and number
- Position: demonstrative comes BEFORE the noun in Arabic: هَٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابُ "this book" (literally "this the book")

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Al-Baqarah showing demonstratives
- ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ, هَٰؤُلَاءِ, etc.
- Morphological analysis for each

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Near vs far, gender/number agreement
- Callout type="warning": "Arabic demonstrative + definite noun construction: هَٰذَا ٱلْكِتَابُ means 'this book' — the ٱلْ is required on the noun (unlike English)"

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "alladhina an'amta") — "صِرَاطَ ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ" [Al-Fatiha 1:7]. ٱلَّذِينَ means "those who" — a relative pronoun introducing a relative clause.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Learn relative pronouns (alladhi, allati, etc.)
  2. Understand relative clause structure in Arabic
  3. Identify relative clauses in Quranic verses

**Section 2 — Understanding Relative Pronouns:**
- Plain English: "Relative pronouns connect two ideas: 'the man WHO wrote' — 'who' is the relative pronoun. Arabic has different forms for gender and number."
- GrammarTable showing relative pronouns:
  - Masculine: ٱلَّذِي (who/which m sg), ٱلَّذَانِ (dual m), ٱلَّذِينَ (who/which m pl)
  - Feminine: ٱلَّتِي (who/which f sg), ٱللَّتَانِ (dual f), ٱللَّاتِي / ٱللَّوَاتِي (f pl)
  - مَنْ (who — for people, any gender/number), مَا (which/what — for things)
- Relative clause structure:
  - ٱلرَّجُلُ ٱلَّذِي كَتَبَ = "the man who wrote"
  - The relative pronoun agrees with its antecedent in gender and number
  - The clause after the relative pronoun is a complete sentence
- Common Quranic pattern: ٱلَّذِينَ آمَنُوا "those who believed"

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Al-Fatiha and Al-Baqarah showing relative pronouns
- Show ٱلَّذِينَ أَنْعَمْتَ عَلَيْهِمْ from Al-Fatiha 1:7
- Morphological analysis showing relative clause structure

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Relative pronoun forms and clause structure
- Callout type="warning": "مَنْ and مَا are invariable — they don't change for gender or number. ٱلَّذِي family changes."
