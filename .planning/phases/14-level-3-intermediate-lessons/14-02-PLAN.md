<objective>
Create L3.02 Verb Form I (al-Fi'l al-Mujarrad) — teaching Form I as the base verb pattern from which all other forms derive. Students learn the fa'ala template, the three vowel classes, and how to identify Form I verbs by checking for absence of augmentation.

Purpose: Form I is the foundation of the verb form system. Students must understand it before learning Forms II-X. This lesson connects root knowledge (L3.01) to verb conjugation (L3.03-L3.05) and verb form modifications (L3.10-L3.15).

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file with 5-part structure, GrammarTable showing Form I pattern application, root+pattern visual breakdown, and Form I identification checklist.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox (all from @components/mdx/)

**Level 3 standards:** Partial transliteration, morphological i'rab (Root/Pattern/Form), 5-part structure.

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated surah) — e.g., "إِيَّاكَ نَعْبُدُ وَإِيَّاكَ نَسْتَعِينُ" [Al-Fatiha 1:5]. Highlight نَعْبُدُ — this is a Form I verb from root ع-ب-د. Contrast with نَسْتَعِينُ which is Form X (preview — not Form I).
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand Form I as the base, simple verb pattern
  2. Recognize the basic fa'ala verb template
  3. Identify Form I verbs in the Quran
- Connection to L3.01: "In [L3.01](/learn/level-3/root-system), you learned that Arabic words are built from 3-letter roots. Now learn how roots become VERBS using the simplest pattern — Form I."
- Connection to L2.03: "In [L2.03](/learn/level-2/verbal-sentence), you learned how verbs function in sentences. Now learn how verbs themselves are CONSTRUCTED."

**Section 2 — Understanding Verb Form I:**
- Plain English first: "Form I is the 'pure' verb — just the root consonants with basic vowels, no extra letters added. If Arabic had only one verb form, this would be it. Every other form (II through X) is a modification of Form I."
- Analogy: "Think of Form I as the plain version of a word. Form I = 'know' (base). Form II = 'teach' (causative). Form V = 'learn' (reflexive). They all come from the same root, but Form I is always the starting point."
- Arabic terminology: [Simple Verb](/resources/glossary#fil-mujarrad) (al-fiʿl al-mujarrad / الفِعْل المُجَرَّد) — literally "the stripped verb" (stripped of augmentation)
- The Form I pattern template: فَعَلَ (faʿala)
  - ف represents the 1st root letter (fāʾ al-fiʿl)
  - ع represents the 2nd root letter (ʿayn al-fiʿl)
  - ل represents the 3rd root letter (lām al-fiʿl)
- GrammarTable showing Form I pattern application with 4-5 roots:
  - Root ك-ت-ب → كَتَبَ (kataba) "he wrote"
  - Root ن-ص-ر → نَصَرَ (naṣara) "he helped"
  - Root ع-ل-م → عَلِمَ (ʿalima) "he knew" [note: fa'ila vowel class]
  - Root ذ-ه-ب → ذَهَبَ (dhahaba) "he went"
  - Root ح-س-ن → حَسُنَ (ḥasuna) "he was good" [note: fa'ula vowel class]
- Three vowel classes explained:
  - فَعَلَ (faʿala) — most common (transitive/active)
  - فَعِلَ (faʿila) — common (stative/emotional: ʿalima, fahima)
  - فَعُلَ (faʿula) — least common (qualities/states: ḥasuna, kabura)
- Form I identification checklist: (1) Count consonants = exactly 3 root letters, (2) No prefix like أ or تَ, (3) No doubling (shadda) on middle letter, (4) Just root + basic vowels = Form I

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated surah)
- Show Form I verbs in context:
  - نَعْبُدُ (naʿbudu) from root ع-ب-د — present tense Form I
  - هَدَى (hadā) from root ه-د-ي — past tense Form I (if applicable in Al-Fatiha context)
  - أَنْعَمْتَ (anʿamta) — point out this is NOT Form I (it's Form IV with أ prefix) — teach by contrast
- Each example with MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab showing Root/Pattern/Form:
  ```
  - **نَعْبُدُ** (naʿbudu): Verb — Present tense, first person plural
    - **Root:** ع-ب-د (ʿ-b-d) "worship, servitude"
    - **Form:** Form I (faʿala → yafʿulu in present)
    - **Pattern check:** 3 root consonants, no doubling, no prefix beyond present tense marker → Form I confirmed
    - **Function:** Main verb of the sentence
  ```
- Include at least one "this is NOT Form I" example to teach recognition by contrast
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one verse (PDGY-07)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form I (al-fiʿl al-mujarrad) is the base verb form containing ONLY the three root consonants with vowels. Pattern: فَعَلَ / فَعِلَ / فَعُلَ. To identify: count consonants (3 only), check for absence of prefixes (no أ, no تَ as augment), check for absence of doubling (no shadda on middle letter). If it's just root + vowels, it's Form I."
- Callout type="warning" (Common Mistakes — PDGY-05):
  - "Don't confuse present tense prefixes (نَ, يَ, تَ, أَ) with Form augmentation — ALL forms use these in present tense, not just higher forms"
  - "Don't assume all Form I verbs have fatha in the middle — some have kasra (عَلِمَ) or damma (حَسُنَ). The vowel class is learned per verb."
  - "Don't confuse Form I with Form IV — Form IV adds أ at the beginning in past tense: كَتَبَ (Form I) vs أَكْتَبَ (Form IV, rare)"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Pattern application (beginner): "Given root ن-ص-ر (n-ṣ-r) 'help/victory', apply the fa'ala pattern to create the Form I past tense verb."
  2. Form I identification (beginner): "Which of these verbs are Form I? عَلِمَ / عَلَّمَ / كَتَبَ / أَنْزَلَ" — with full morphological analysis in answer
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find the Form I verbs in this Al-Fatiha verse. For each, identify the root and explain how you know it's Form I."
  4. Contrast exercise (intermediate): "Compare خَلَقَ (Form I) and أَخْلَقَ (if exists) or compare Form I ذَهَبَ with a Form II verb. Explain the structural differences."
- Each answer includes morphological analysis with root+pattern+form

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- PARTIAL transliteration per Level 3 rules
- Quranic examples from Surah Al-Fatiha (designated surah)
- First-mention bilingual format per TERMINOLOGY.md
- MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab: Function + Case + Reason + Root/Pattern/Form
- One major concept (PDGY-08): Form I identification and pattern ONLY — conjugation is L3.03+
- Teach by CONTRAST: show non-Form I examples and explain why they're different
