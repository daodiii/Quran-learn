<objective>
Create L3.01 The Root System (Jadhr) — the foundational lesson for all of Level 3 morphology. This lesson teaches that Arabic words are built from 3-letter roots using predictable patterns, introduces the LEGO brick analogy, and provides practical dictionary lookup strategy.

Purpose: L3.01 is the gateway to morphology (sarf). Every subsequent Level 3 lesson depends on understanding roots. This lesson makes the abstract concept concrete through the LEGO brick analogy and immediately practical through dictionary lookup strategy.

Output: 1 complete MDX lesson file with 5-part structure, partial transliteration, morphological i'rab analysis, root+pattern visualization using GrammarTable, and dictionary lookup worked examples.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox (all from @components/mdx/)

**CRITICAL — Level 3 differences from Level 2:**
1. **PARTIAL transliteration** — Familiar words from L1-2 (common particles, Al-Fatiha vocab, basic pronouns) can appear Arabic-only in prose. NEW vocabulary gets transliteration. ArabicExample components should still have transliteration prop for accessibility.
2. **MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab** — Extend Level 2's "Function + Case + Reason" to include "Root/Pattern/Form" analysis.
3. **Root+pattern visualization** — Use GrammarTable to show how one root produces multiple word types.

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah (CURRICULUM_MAP designated surah) showing a word from root ك-ت-ب, e.g., "ذَٰلِكَ ٱلْكِتَابُ لَا رَيْبَ فِيهِ" [Al-Baqarah 2:2]. Highlight ٱلْكِتَابُ and explain it comes from root ك-ت-ب meaning "writing."
- Key transition from Level 2: "In Levels 1 and 2, you learned how sentences work — how nouns and verbs relate to each other. Now Level 3 teaches you how WORDS THEMSELVES are built. This is Arabic morphology (sarf / صَرْف), and it starts with the root system."
- Learning Objectives (from CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Understand the concept of trilateral (three-letter) roots as the foundation of Arabic words
  2. Recognize how words are derived from root letters using patterns
  3. Extract roots from Quranic words for dictionary lookup
- Connection to L1.06: "In [L1.06](/learn/level-1/three-word-types), you learned that Arabic has nouns, verbs, and particles. Now you'll discover that nouns and verbs are built from the same building blocks — roots."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Root System:**
- LEGO brick analogy (from STATE.md decision): "Every Arabic word is built like LEGO bricks: Root letters are the bricks (3 consonants carrying core meaning). Patterns are the blueprints (vowel templates showing word type). Different blueprints + same bricks = different words with related meanings."
- Plain English first: "A root is a group of 3 consonants (sometimes 4) that carry a core meaning. By inserting different vowels and adding letters, you create a whole FAMILY of related words."
- Arabic terminology: [root](/resources/glossary#jadhr) (jadhr / جَذْر) — also called [radical letters](/resources/glossary#huruf-asliyyah) (ḥurūf aṣliyyah / حُرُوف أَصْلِيَّة)
- GrammarTable showing root ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing" in different patterns:
  - فَعَلَ (faʿala) → كَتَبَ (kataba) "he wrote" — Verb Form I past
  - يَفْعُلُ (yafʿulu) → يَكْتُبُ (yaktubu) "he writes" — Verb Form I present
  - فَاعِل (fāʿil) → كَاتِب (kātib) "writer" — Active participle
  - مَفْعُول (mafʿūl) → مَكْتُوب (maktūb) "written" — Passive participle
  - فِعَال (fiʿāl) → كِتَاب (kitāb) "book" — Verbal noun
  - مَفْعَل (mafʿal) → مَكْتَب (maktab) "desk/office" — Noun of place
  - مَفْعَلَة → مَكْتَبَة (maktabah) "library" — Noun of place (feminine)
- Explain: "ALL of these share ك-ت-ب. Once you know the root, you can decode an entire word family."
- Trilateral roots (3 letters) vs quadrilateral roots (4 letters — mention briefly, 80%+ of Arabic roots are trilateral)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Baqarah showing different words from root ك-ت-ب and other roots
- Example 1: ٱلْكِتَابُ (al-kitābu) "the book" from Al-Baqarah 2:2 — root ك-ت-ب
- Example 2: كَتَبَ (kataba) "He wrote/decreed" from Al-Mujadilah 58:21 or similar — root ك-ت-ب
- Example 3: A different root, e.g., عَلِمَ (ʿalima) from root ع-ل-م "knowledge" — show word family
- Each example with MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab:
  ```
  - **ٱلْكِتَابُ** (al-kitābu): Subject (mubtadaʾ) — Nominative (rafʿ), marked by damma
    - **Root:** ك-ت-ب (k-t-b) "writing"
    - **Pattern:** فِعَال (fiʿāl) — noun of action/result
    - **Morphology:** Definite noun with ٱلْ prefix, derived from root meaning "writing"
  ```
- Word-by-word morphological breakdown for at least one complete verse (PDGY-07)

**Section 4 — Dictionary Lookup Strategy (CRITICAL — from STATE.md decision):**
- Callout type="rule": Present the step-by-step dictionary lookup process:
  1. Remove all prefixes and suffixes (ٱلْ, وَ, لِ, -ونَ, -ةَ, etc.)
  2. Identify the root consonants (usually 3 letters)
  3. Look up the root in the dictionary
- Worked example: مَكْتَبَة → strip ة → مَكْتَب → identify م as pattern prefix → root is ك-ت-ب → look up ك-ت-ب → meaning "writing" → مَفْعَلَة pattern = noun of place → "library"
- Second worked example with a Quranic word
- Common Mistakes (PDGY-05):
  - "Don't count pattern letters as root letters — م in مَكْتَب is part of the pattern, not the root"
  - "Don't assume every 3 consecutive consonants are a root — learn to recognize common patterns"
  - Callout type="warning" for common confusion between root consonants and pattern additions

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Root identification (beginner): "What are the three root consonants of كَاتِب (kātib) 'writer'?"
  2. Pattern matching (beginner): "Given root ع-ل-م (ʿ-l-m) 'knowledge', which of these words comes from it? عَلِمَ / ذَهَبَ / عَالِم / كَتَبَ"
  3. Word family (intermediate): "Given root ح-م-د (ḥ-m-d) 'praise', list the words you can recognize from this root and explain their patterns"
  4. Dictionary lookup (intermediate): "You encounter the word مُسْلِمُونَ in a verse. Walk through the dictionary lookup steps to find its root."
- Each answer includes morphological analysis showing root extraction

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Three Word Types](/learn/level-1/three-word-types) — "Where you learned nouns, verbs, and particles"
- Next: [Verb Form I](/learn/level-3/verb-form-i) — "How roots become verbs using the simplest pattern"
- Next: [Verb Form II](/learn/level-3/verb-form-ii) — "How doubling a root letter changes meaning"
- Reference: [Root System Guide](/resources/root-system-guide) — "Complete reference for root extraction and dictionary use"
- Reference: [200 Most Common Quranic Words](/resources/common-words) — "Practice root identification with frequently used words"

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- PARTIAL transliteration: familiar L1-2 words (وَ, لَا, فِي, ٱللَّهُ in prose) can be Arabic-only. New vocabulary and all ArabicExample components get transliteration.
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format for all grammar terms per TERMINOLOGY.md
- MORPHOLOGICAL i'rab: Function + Case + Reason + Root/Pattern/Form
- One major concept per lesson (PDGY-08): root system and dictionary lookup ONLY — verb patterns are L3.02+
- Use LEGO brick analogy for root+pattern visualization
