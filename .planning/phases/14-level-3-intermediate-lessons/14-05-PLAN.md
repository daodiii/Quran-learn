<objective>
Create L3.12 Verb Form IV (If'al) and L3.16 Active & Passive Participles — two lessons that both depend only on L3.02 (Form I). Form IV teaches the alif-prefix causative pattern. Participles teach how verbs become noun/adjective forms (doer and receiver).

Purpose: Form IV is the third most common derived form in the Quran (after Forms I and II). Participles are among the most frequent word types in Arabic — understanding them unlocks vocabulary recognition. Together these lessons expand the student's morphological toolkit.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with pattern visualization, Form I comparison, and Quranic examples.

title: "Verb Form IV (If'al)"
level: 3
order: 12
description: "Recognize Form IV verbs with alif prefix and understand their causative meaning."
draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Duha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) — e.g., "أَلَمْ يَجِدْكَ يَتِيمًا فَآوَىٰ" [Al-Duha 93:6] or find a Form IV verb in Al-Duha. The surah mentions أَغْنَى (aghnā) [93:8] from root غ-ن-ي "richness" — Form IV meaning "He enriched/made self-sufficient."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Recognize Form IV pattern (afʿala) with alif prefix
  2. Understand Form IV meaning: causative
  3. Identify Form IV verbs in the Quran
- Connection: "Like Form II, Form IV creates causative verbs. But while Form II doubles the middle letter, Form IV adds an alif prefix. Both can mean 'making someone do something' but from different roots."

**Section 2 — Understanding Form IV:**
- Plain English: "Form IV creates causative meaning by adding an alif (hamza) prefix: 'he believed' (Form I) → 'he made [someone] believe/he submitted [to God].' Form IV is VERY common in the Quran — أَسْلَمَ (aslama, 'he submitted to Islam') is Form IV."
- Semantic shift examples:
  - Form I سَلِمَ (salima) "he was safe" → Form IV أَسْلَمَ (aslama) "he submitted" (entered safety/peace)
  - Form I نْزَلَ (nazala) "he descended" → Form IV أَنْزَلَ (anzala) "he sent down" (caused to descend)
  - Form I خْرَجَ (kharaja) "he went out" → Form IV أَخْرَجَ (akhraja) "he expelled" (caused to go out)
  - Form I حْسَنَ (ḥasuna) "he was good" → Form IV أَحْسَنَ (aḥsana) "he did good" (caused goodness)
- Pattern template: أَفْعَلَ (afʿala) — hamza prefix + sukun on first root letter
- Visual decomposition:
  ```
  Root: ن-ز-ل (n-z-l) "descending"
  Form I: فَعَلَ → نَزَلَ "he descended"
  Form IV: أَفْعَلَ → أَنْزَلَ "he sent down"
  The hamza prefix أَ + sukun on first root letter is the Form IV marker
  ```
- GrammarTable: Form I vs Form IV for 4 roots
- VerbConjugation: representative forms (6-8 persons)
- Compare Form II vs Form IV: Both can be causative, but different structural markers. Form II = doubled middle, Form IV = alif prefix.

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Duha showing Form IV verbs
- Morphological i'rab with root/pattern/form for each
- Show أَنْعَمَ from Al-Fatiha 1:7 as a well-known Form IV verb

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Form IV identification and meaning
- Callout type="warning": "Don't confuse Form IV أَفْعَلَ with Form I verbs that happen to start with hamza (like أَكَلَ 'he ate' — root is أ-ك-ل, not a Form IV prefix)"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Form identification (beginner)
  2. Semantic shift prediction (beginner)
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate)
  4. Form II vs IV comparison (intermediate)

description: "Derive active participles (one who does) and passive participles (one to whom it is done) from verbs, and identify them in Quranic text."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (CURRICULUM_MAP designated) — e.g., ٱلرَّحْمَنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ [Al-Fatiha 1:3]. ٱلرَّحْمَنِ is an active participle form (intensive pattern) and ٱلرَّحِيمِ is an intensive adjective form — both derived from root ر-ح-م "mercy."
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Derive active participles (one who does) from verbs
  2. Derive passive participles (one to whom it is done) from verbs
  3. Identify participles functioning as nouns and adjectives in the Quran
- Connection: "You've learned how roots become verbs (Form I in L3.02). Now learn how verbs become NOUNS — specifically, nouns that describe the doer (active participle) and the receiver (passive participle)."

**Section 2 — Understanding Participles:**
- Plain English: "A participle turns a verb into a noun or adjective. The active participle names the DOER: 'writer' from 'to write.' The passive participle names the RECEIVER: 'written' from 'to write.' Arabic does this with predictable patterns."
- Analogy: "In English, -er makes doers (teach → teacher) and -ed makes receivers (teach → taught/taught one). Arabic is even more systematic: one pattern for ALL Form I active participles, one for ALL passive participles."
- Arabic terminology:
  - [active participle](/resources/glossary#ism-fail) (ism fāʿil / اِسْم فَاعِل) — "the doer noun"
  - [passive participle](/resources/glossary#ism-maful) (ism mafʿūl / اِسْم مَفْعُول) — "the done-to noun"
- Form I patterns:
  - Active: فَاعِل (fāʿil) → كَاتِب (kātib) "writer/writing (one)"
  - Passive: مَفْعُول (mafʿūl) → مَكْتُوب (maktūb) "written (thing)"
- GrammarTable showing participle derivation from 5-6 roots:
  - ك-ت-ب: كَاتِب (writer) / مَكْتُوب (written)
  - ع-ل-م: عَالِم (knower/scholar) / مَعْلُوم (known)
  - ع-ب-د: عَابِد (worshipper) / مَعْبُود (worshipped)
  - ح-م-د: حَامِد (praiser) / مَحْمُود (praised)
  - ن-ص-ر: نَاصِر (helper) / مَنْصُور (helped/victorious)
- Brief mention of participles from derived forms (Form II-X patterns are different — reference verb-forms-chart)
- Participles function as both nouns AND adjectives: مُسْلِم (muslim) = "one who submits" (noun) OR "submitting" (adjective)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha
- Show participles in context:
  - ٱلْحَمْدُ — from root ح-م-د, related to active participle حَامِد
  - رَبّ ٱلْعَالَمِينَ — عَالَمِينَ from root ع-ل-م (though this is a noun of place/time, not a standard participle — clarify)
  - ٱلصِّرَاطَ ٱلْمُسْتَقِيمَ — مُسْتَقِيم is a Form X active participle from root ق-و-م (preview of derived form participles)
- Morphological i'rab showing participle identification

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Form I Active Participle = فَاعِل (fāʿil). Form I Passive Participle = مَفْعُول (mafʿūl). These patterns work for most Form I verbs. For derived forms (II-X), the active participle uses مُ- prefix with kasra before last root letter, passive uses مُ- prefix with fatha before last root letter."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Not every فَاعِل-pattern word is an active participle — some are broken plural patterns or other noun types. Check the root."
  - "Participles can take case endings like any noun: مُسْلِمٌ (nominative), مُسْلِمًا (accusative), مُسْلِمٍ (genitive)"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Derivation (beginner): "Derive the active and passive participle from root ن-ص-ر using Form I patterns."
  2. Identification (beginner): "Which of these are active participles? كَاتِب / كِتَاب / عَالِم / عِلْم"
  3. Quranic analysis (intermediate): "Find participles in these Al-Fatiha verses. Identify root, type (active/passive), and meaning."
  4. Function analysis (intermediate): "Is مُؤْمِنِينَ (believers) functioning as a noun or adjective in this verse? Explain."
