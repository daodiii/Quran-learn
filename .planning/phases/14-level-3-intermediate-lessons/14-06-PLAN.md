<objective>
Create L3.05 Imperative Mood (al-Amr) and L3.06 Subject Pronouns (Dama'ir al-Raf') — completing the verb conjugation trio (past/present/imperative) and beginning the pronoun system.

Purpose: L3.05 completes the three moods/tenses a student needs for verb recognition. Imperatives are extremely common in the Quran (قُلْ "say" appears 332 times). L3.06 systematizes the pronoun knowledge students have been building implicitly through conjugation lessons, distinguishing explicit vs implicit pronouns.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with imperative derivation rules and complete pronoun chart.

title: "Imperative Mood (al-Amr)"
level: 3
order: 5
description: "Derive imperative forms from present tense verbs and recognize Quranic commands."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, VerbConjugation, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "qul") — "قُلْ أَعُوذُ بِرَبِّ ٱلْفَلَقِ" [Al-Falaq 113:1]. قُلْ is an imperative — a command to "Say!" It appears at the start of four Quranic surahs (Al-Kafirun, Al-Ikhlas, Al-Falaq, An-Nas).
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Derive imperative forms from present tense
  2. Understand command forms for different addressees (you-masc, you-fem, you-plural)
  3. Recognize imperatives in Quranic commands
- Connection: "In [L3.04](/learn/level-3/present-tense), you learned the present tense يَفْعَلُ. The imperative is derived FROM the present tense by removing the prefix and adjusting the vowels."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Imperative:**
- Plain English: "The imperative is the command form: 'Write!', 'Go!', 'Say!' In Arabic, commands exist only for 'you' forms (2nd person). You can't command 'he' or 'I' to do something (those use different constructions)."
- Derivation process:
  1. Start with present tense يَفْعَلُ form
  2. Remove the prefix يَ
  3. Remove indicative ending
  4. If the result starts with a consonant cluster, add hamzat al-wasl (اِ)
- GrammarTable showing imperative derivation for 3-4 verbs:
  - يَكْتُبُ → اُكْتُبْ (uktub) "Write!"
  - يَذْهَبُ → اِذْهَبْ (idh'hab) "Go!"
  - يَقُولُ → قُلْ (qul) "Say!"
  - يَجْلِسُ → اِجْلِسْ (ijlis) "Sit!"
- VerbConjugation showing imperative persons (6 forms only — no 3rd person, no 1st person):
  - أَنْتَ (you m sg), أَنْتِ (you f sg), أَنْتُمَا (you dual), أَنْتُمْ (you m pl), أَنْتُنَّ (you f pl)
- Note irregular common imperatives: قُلْ (say), كُلْ (eat), خُذْ (take)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq and other short surahs
- Show قُلْ and other imperatives in context
- Morphological i'rab: identify root, derive from present tense, show form
- Word-by-word breakdown for at least one verse

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Imperative derivation rules
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't confuse imperative with jussive mood — both can have sukun endings, but jussive retains the prefix"
  - "Some common imperatives are irregular and must be memorized: قُلْ, كُلْ, خُذْ"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Derivation (beginner): "Derive the imperative from يَنْصُرُ (yanṣuru 'he helps') for 'you (m sg).'"
  2. Identification (beginner): "Which are imperatives? قُلْ / يَقُولُ / اُكْتُبْ / كَتَبَ"
  3. Quranic identification (intermediate): "Find all imperatives in Surah Al-Falaq. For each, give the root and present tense form."
  4. Conjugation (intermediate): "Give the imperative forms for كَتَبَ for: you (m), you (f), you (m pl)."

description: "Learn all 12 independent subject pronouns and understand when pronouns are explicit vs. implicit in verb conjugations."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (CURRICULUM_MAP designated: "huwa") — "قُلْ هُوَ ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ" [Al-Ikhlas 112:1]. هُوَ (huwa) "He" is an independent subject pronoun. It doesn't need to be there (the verb already indicates the subject), but it's used for EMPHASIS.
- Learning Objectives:
  1. Memorize all 12 independent subject pronouns
  2. Understand when pronouns are explicit vs. implicit in verb conjugations
  3. Identify subject pronouns in Quranic verses
- Connection: "In [L3.03](/learn/level-3/past-tense) and [L3.04](/learn/level-3/present-tense), you saw verb suffixes and prefixes that indicate WHO does the action. Those are IMPLICIT pronouns built into the verb. Now learn the EXPLICIT, standalone pronouns."

**Section 2 — Understanding Subject Pronouns:**
- Plain English: "Arabic has 12 independent pronouns (English has about 7). Arabic distinguishes: (1) masculine/feminine, (2) singular/dual/plural, (3) first/second/third person. That gives 12 combinations."
- GrammarTable showing all 12 independent pronouns:
  - 1st person: أَنَا (I), نَحْنُ (we)
  - 2nd person masc: أَنْتَ (you m sg), أَنْتُمَا (you dual), أَنْتُمْ (you m pl)
  - 2nd person fem: أَنْتِ (you f sg), أَنْتُمَا (you dual), أَنْتُنَّ (you f pl)
  - 3rd person masc: هُوَ (he), هُمَا (they dual), هُمْ (they m)
  - 3rd person fem: هِيَ (she), هُمَا (they dual f), هُنَّ (they f)
- **KEY CONCEPT — explicit vs implicit (14-RESEARCH.md Pitfall 4):**
  - Implicit: كَتَبَ = "he wrote" — the "he" is embedded in the verb conjugation
  - Explicit: هُوَ كَتَبَ = "HE wrote" — emphasis or contrast
  - Rule: Arabic usually OMITS the pronoun because the verb already shows it. When a pronoun appears, it's for emphasis, contrast, or in nominal sentences.
- When independent pronouns are NEEDED:
  1. Nominal sentence subjects: أَنَا طَالِبٌ "I am a student"
  2. Emphasis/contrast: هُوَ ٱللَّهُ "HE is Allah" (emphasizing identity)
  3. After certain particles: إِيَّاكَ (object pronoun) vs أَنْتَ (subject pronoun)
- GrammarTable comparing verb conjugation suffix with matching pronoun

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas showing pronouns
- Show هُوَ in Al-Ikhlas
- Show different pronouns from other Quranic passages
- Morphological i'rab for pronoun function in sentences

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic has 12 independent pronouns. In verbal sentences, the pronoun is usually IMPLICIT in the verb. In nominal sentences, the pronoun appears EXPLICITLY as the subject. When a pronoun appears alongside a verb, it adds emphasis."
- Callout type="warning":
  - "Don't add pronouns where verbs already indicate the person — Arabic prefers implicit pronouns"
  - "Don't confuse أَنْتَ (you m) with أَنْتِ (you f) — only the final vowel differs"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox:
  1. Identification (beginner): "Match each pronoun to its meaning: أَنَا, هُوَ, نَحْنُ, هُمْ"
  2. Explicit vs implicit (beginner): "In كَتَبُوا, is the pronoun explicit or implicit? What about in هُمْ كَتَبُوا?"
  3. Quranic usage (intermediate): "Find all explicit pronouns in Surah Al-Ikhlas. Why does each one appear?"
  4. Pronoun selection (intermediate): "Which pronoun would you use in each blank? ___ عَالِمٌ (she is a scholar), ___ كَتَبْنَا (we wrote)"
