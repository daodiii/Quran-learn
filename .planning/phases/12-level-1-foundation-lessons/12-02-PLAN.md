<objective>
Create 2 Level 1 Foundation lessons: L1.04 covering sukun, shadda, and tanween special marks, and L1.05 providing reading practice by applying all learned rules to the Bismillah phrase.

Purpose: L1.04 completes the Arabic reading toolkit (short vowels + long vowels + special marks). L1.05 is the synthesis lesson where learners apply ALL reading rules to a real Quranic phrase, building confidence before grammar lessons begin. Together they bridge the alphabet/vowels chain to the grammar chain.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic examples from Al-Masad (L1.04) and Bismillah (L1.05), and 3-4 exercises each.

level: 1
order: 4
description: "Recognize sukun (vowel absence), pronounce shadda (consonant doubling), and understand tanween's three forms."
draft: false

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Masad showing clear examples of sukun, shadda, and tanween in action
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Recognize sukun (vowel absence) and its pronunciation effect
  2. Pronounce shadda (consonant doubling) correctly
  3. Understand tanween (nunation) and its three forms
- Connection: "In L1.02 you learned that every consonant carries a vowel mark. But what happens when there's NO vowel? And how do we show a doubled consonant or an '-n' ending? These three special marks complete your reading toolkit."

**Section 2 — Understanding Sukun, Shadda & Tanween:**
- **Sukun** — Plain English first: "Sometimes a consonant has NO vowel after it — like the 'k' in 'ask'. Arabic marks this silence with a small circle (ـْ) above the letter."
- English analogy: "Think of sukun as a 'stop sign' for the voice — the consonant sounds but immediately stops."
- Introduce: [sukun](/resources/glossary#sukun) (sukūn / سُكُون)

- **Shadda** — Plain English first: "Sometimes you need to say a consonant TWICE, like the double 't' in 'butter'. Arabic marks this with a small 'w' shape (ـّ) above the letter."
- English analogy: "In English, 'later' vs 'latter' — the double 't' changes meaning. Arabic doubles consonants the same way."
- Introduce: [shadda](/resources/glossary#shadda) (shaddah / شَدَّة)

- **Tanween** — Plain English first: "Tanween adds an '-n' sound to the end of a word, similar to how English uses 'a/an' — it signals the word is indefinite (not specific)."
- GrammarTable showing three tanween forms: fathatain (ـً), kasratain (ـٍ), dammatain (ـٌ)
- English analogy: "Like 'a book' vs 'the book' — tanween tells you it's 'a book' (indefinite)"
- Introduce: [tanween](/resources/glossary#tanween) (tanwīn / تَنْوِين)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Masad
- Show sukun examples with word-by-word breakdown
- Show shadda examples (Surah Al-Masad has prominent shadda usage)
- Show tanween examples in all three forms
- All fully vocalized, all with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": Concise summary of all three marks with their symbols and effects
- Callout type="warning": Common mistakes — forgetting to double the consonant sound on shadda, confusing tanween with regular vowels

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Find all the sukun marks in this verse"
  2. Pronunciation: "How would you pronounce this word with shadda?"
  3. Analysis: "Which tanween form is used on this word — and what does it tell you?"
  4. Synthesis: "Read this phrase aloud, applying sukun, shadda, and tanween correctly"

title: "Reading Practice with Bismillah"
level: 1
order: 5
description: "Apply all reading rules to break down and read the Bismillah phrase accurately."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: Full Bismillah (بِسْمِ ٱللَّهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيمِ) as ArabicExample — "This is the most recited phrase in the entire Quran. Let's read it together, letter by letter."
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Apply all learned reading rules to read Bismillah accurately
  2. Break down each word into its phonetic components
  3. Recognize common Quranic opening phrase structure
- Connection: "You've learned letters (L1.01), short vowels (L1.02), long vowels (L1.03), and special marks (L1.04). Now let's put it ALL together with the most important phrase in the Quran."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Bismillah:**
- Plain English first: "This phrase means 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.' Muslims say it before almost every action. It appears at the beginning of every surah except one."
- Break down into 4 words using a step-by-step phonetic analysis:
  1. بِسْمِ (bismi) — letter-by-letter: ba+kasra, sin+sukun, mim+kasra
  2. ٱللَّهِ (allāhi) — alif wasla, lam+shadda+fatha, ha+kasra
  3. ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (ar-raḥmāni) — show assimilation of lam with ra (sun letter)
  4. ٱلرَّحِيمِ (ar-raḥīmi) — point out the long vowel (ī) vs short vowel in previous word
- English analogy: "Think of this like reading a sentence in a new language — you already know all the sounds, now you're just combining them"
- Introduce terminology: [Bismillah](/resources/glossary#bismillah) (basmalah / بَسْمَلَة)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- Primary: Full Bismillah with detailed word-by-word breakdown using ArabicExample for each word
- Show each word individually with highlight of the reading rules being applied
- Then show full phrase connected
- Optional: Show 1-2 other short opening phrases from Juz 'Amma for additional practice
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Reading Arabic combines: letter recognition + vowel marks + special marks (sukun, shadda, tanween). Read each letter with its mark, connect the sounds smoothly, and pause only at sukun or word boundaries."
- Callout type="tip": "Practice reading slowly first, then gradually increase speed. Accuracy before fluency."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Guided: "Break down the word ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ letter by letter — what mark does each consonant carry?"
  2. Recognition: "Identify all the sukun, shadda, and long vowels in the Bismillah"
  3. Reading: "Read this short phrase from Surah Al-Fatiha using all your reading rules" (provide a different phrase for independent practice)
  4. Analysis: "What reading rule applies to the lam (ل) in ٱلرَّحِيمِ? Why doesn't it sound like 'al-'?"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Prerequisites: [Long Vowels & Diphthongs](/learn/level-1/long-vowels-diphthongs), [Sukun, Shadda & Tanween](/learn/level-1/sukun-shadda-tanween)
- Next: [Three Word Types](/learn/level-1/three-word-types) — "Now that you can READ Arabic, let's start understanding it"

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic (Level 1)
- Use simplified ALA-LC per STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format per TERMINOLOGY.md
