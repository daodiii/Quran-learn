<objective>
Create the final 2 Level 1 Foundation lessons: L1.10 introducing simple sentence types (nominal and verbal), and L1.11 introducing case endings as a preview of the Level 2 case system.

Purpose: L1.10 is the first sentence-level lesson — it transitions from individual word properties to how words combine into sentences, introducing the fundamental nominal/verbal sentence distinction that structures ALL Arabic grammar. L1.11 provides the conceptual bridge to Level 2 by showing that word endings change based on function — setting up the detailed case study that follows. Together they complete Level 1 and prepare learners for the Core Grammar level.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic examples from Al-Kafirun (L1.10) and Al-Ikhlas (L1.11), and 3-4 exercises each.

title: "Introduction to Simple Sentences"
level: 1
order: 10
description: "Understand that Arabic has two basic sentence types and identify subjects, actions, and descriptions in simple sentences."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kafirun showing simple, repetitive sentence structures — "Every sentence you read in the Quran is either one of two types. Let's learn to tell them apart."
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Understand that Arabic has two basic sentence types (nominal and verbal)
  2. Identify the subject and action/description in simple sentences
  3. Recognize basic sentence word order patterns
- Connection: "You've learned word types (L1.06), the definite article (L1.07), gender (L1.08), and number (L1.09). Now let's see how words come together to form SENTENCES."

**Section 2 — Understanding Simple Sentences:**
- Plain English first: "In English, we usually say 'The boy runs' (subject + verb). Arabic has two patterns: one that starts with a NOUN and one that starts with a VERB."
- English analogy: "'The sky is blue' describes something (starts with a noun = nominal). 'He runs fast' shows an action (starts with a verb = verbal). Arabic makes this distinction FUNDAMENTAL."

- **Nominal Sentence (starts with a noun):**
- Plain English: "A sentence that begins with a noun or pronoun. It describes a state: 'The book [is] big', 'Allah [is] one'. Notice Arabic doesn't need the word 'is' — it's implied."
- Introduce: [nominal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-ismiyyah) (jumlah ismiyyah / جُمْلَة اِسْمِيَّة)
- Two parts: Subject (what we're talking about) + Predicate (what we're saying about it)
- Introduce: [subject](/resources/glossary#mubtada) (mubtadaʾ / مُبْتَدَأ) and [predicate](/resources/glossary#khabar) (khabar / خَبَر)

- **Verbal Sentence (starts with a verb):**
- Plain English: "A sentence that begins with a verb. It shows an action: 'He said...' 'They believed...' 'We created...'"
- Introduce: [verbal sentence](/resources/glossary#jumlah-filiyyah) (jumlah fiʿliyyah / جُمْلَة فِعْلِيَّة)
- Key elements: Verb + Subject (doer of action) + optional Object

- GrammarTable comparing the two sentence types with structure, examples, and English equivalents

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kafirun
- Show nominal sentence examples: identify subject and predicate
- Show verbal sentence examples: identify verb and subject
- Word-by-word breakdown of each example
- Note the absence of "is/are" in nominal sentences
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic has exactly two sentence types: nominal (jumlah ismiyyah — starts with a noun, describes a state) and verbal (jumlah fiʿliyyah — starts with a verb, shows an action). To identify the type, look at the FIRST word."
- Callout type="warning": "Arabic nominal sentences have NO word for 'is' or 'are'. 'ٱللَّهُ أَحَدٌ' literally translates as 'Allah one' but MEANS 'Allah is one.' Don't look for a missing verb — it's not needed."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Classification: "Is this a nominal or verbal sentence? What's the first word — noun or verb?"
  2. Identification: "Find the subject and predicate in this nominal sentence"
  3. Analysis: "In this Quranic verse, identify whether each clause is nominal or verbal"
  4. Synthesis: "For each sentence, identify: type (nominal/verbal), subject, and predicate/verb"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Three Word Types](/learn/level-1/three-word-types)
- Next: [Introduction to Case Endings](/learn/level-1/case-endings) — "Now that you can identify sentence parts, let's see how Arabic MARKS each part"

title: "Introduction to Case Endings"
level: 1
order: 11
description: "Understand that Arabic nouns change endings based on grammatical function and recognize the three case endings visually."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas showing the same root word with different endings — "Notice how the endings of these words change? That's not random — it's Arabic telling you what ROLE each word plays in the sentence."
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Understand that Arabic nouns change endings based on grammatical function
  2. Recognize the three case endings visually (damma, fatha, kasra patterns)
  3. Grasp the concept of grammatical case as a functional marker
- Connection: "In L1.10 you learned to identify sentence parts (subject, predicate, verb). Now let's see how Arabic MARKS those parts — the ending of a noun tells you its JOB in the sentence."

**Section 2 — Understanding Case Endings:**
- Plain English first: "In English, word ORDER tells you who does what: 'The boy helped the man' vs 'The man helped the boy'. Arabic uses a different system — it changes the ENDING of the noun. This means Arabic word order is more flexible."
- English analogy: "Think of case endings as name badges. In a meeting, badges say 'Speaker', 'Guest', 'Organizer'. Arabic puts a tiny 'badge' (vowel ending) on each noun to show its role — subject, object, or after a preposition."

- **The Three Cases (INTRODUCTION ONLY — details in Level 2):**

- **Nominative (the 'doer' case):** Marked by damma (ـُ) or dammatain (ـٌ)
- English: "The SUBJECT of a sentence — the one doing or being"
- Introduce: [nominative](/resources/glossary#raf) (rafʿ / رَفْع)

- **Accusative (the 'receiver' case):** Marked by fatha (ـَ) or fathatain (ـً)
- English: "The OBJECT of a verb — the one receiving the action"
- Introduce: [accusative](/resources/glossary#nasb) (naṣb / نَصْب)

- **Genitive (the 'after preposition' case):** Marked by kasra (ـِ) or kasratain (ـٍ)
- English: "After prepositions like 'in', 'from', 'to' and in possession phrases"
- Introduce: [genitive](/resources/glossary#jarr) (jarr / جَرّ)

- GrammarTable: case name, Arabic term, ending marker, when it's used, simple example
- Introduce: [grammatical case](/resources/glossary#irab) (iʿrāb / إِعْرَاب) — "The system of changing noun endings to show grammatical function"

- Key insight: "You already KNOW these marks! Damma (L1.02), fatha (L1.02), kasra (L1.02), tanween (L1.04) — case endings use the same vowel marks you've already learned, just applied to word endings."

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (simple case ending examples)
- Show the same type of noun in different cases if possible
- Highlight the ending vowels that indicate case
- Word-by-word breakdown with case identification: "ٱللَّهُ (Allah — nominative, damma ending, subject)"
- Cross-reference to Case Endings Chart: [Case Endings Reference](/resources/case-endings-chart)
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic nouns change their ending vowel to show grammatical function. Damma (ـُ/ـٌ) = nominative (subject). Fatha (ـَ/ـً) = accusative (object). Kasra (ـِ/ـٍ) = genitive (after prepositions). This system is called iʿrāb."
- Callout type="tip": "You don't need to MASTER cases yet — that's what Level 2 is for. For now, just notice that endings change and understand WHY. Awareness is the goal."
- Callout type="warning": "Don't try to memorize all case rules now. Focus on recognizing the three markers (ـُ ـَ ـِ) and understanding that they indicate function."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Visual recognition: "What case ending does this word have — damma, fatha, or kasra?"
  2. Matching: "Match each case ending to its function: nominative/accusative/genitive"
  3. Identification: "In this verse from Al-Ikhlas, what case is the word ٱللَّهُ in, and what ending tells you?"
  4. Awareness: "Read this Quranic phrase and circle all the case endings you can spot — don't worry about identifying their function yet"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Introduction to Simple Sentences](/learn/level-1/simple-sentences)
- Reference: [Case Endings Chart](/resources/case-endings-chart)
- Prepares for: [L2.01: The Nominal Sentence](/learn/level-2/nominal-sentence), [L2.04: The Nominative Case](/learn/level-2/nominative-case), [L2.05: The Accusative Case](/learn/level-2/accusative-case), [L2.06: The Genitive Case](/learn/level-2/genitive-case)
- Congratulatory note: "You've completed Level 1! You can now read Arabic, identify word types, understand noun properties, recognize sentence types, and spot case endings. Level 2 will deepen your understanding of each of these concepts."

**Critical requirements for BOTH lessons:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic (Level 1)
- Use simplified ALA-LC transliteration per STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format per TERMINOLOGY.md
- L1.11 should introduce cases at CONCEPTUAL level only — detailed rules are Level 2 content
