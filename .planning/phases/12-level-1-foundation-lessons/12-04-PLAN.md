<objective>
Create 2 Level 1 Foundation lessons covering Arabic noun properties: L1.08 on grammatical gender (masculine/feminine) and L1.09 on number (singular/dual/plural).

Purpose: Gender and number are essential noun properties that affect agreement in every Arabic sentence. L1.08 teaches how to identify a noun's gender (critical for adjective agreement later). L1.09 introduces the unique Arabic dual form alongside singular/plural — a concept with no English equivalent that frequently appears in the Quran. Together they complete the noun property fundamentals before sentence construction.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic examples from An-Nasr (L1.08) and Al-Falaq (L1.09), and 3-4 exercises each.

```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah An-Nasr showing words with different genders (نَصْر masculine, فَتْح masculine, جَنَّة feminine)
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Identify masculine and feminine nouns by their endings
  2. Understand the taa marbuta (ة) as a feminine marker
  3. Recognize gender patterns in common Quranic words
- Connection: "In L1.06 you learned that ism (nouns) are one of three word types. Now let's discover that every Arabic noun has a GENDER — masculine or feminine — and there are simple clues to tell which is which."

**Section 2 — Understanding Gender in Arabic:**
- Plain English first: "In English, most objects have no gender — a 'book' is just a 'book'. But in Arabic (like Spanish or French), EVERY noun has a gender — masculine or feminine. Don't worry: there are easy clues."
- English analogy: "Think of it like some English words that have natural gender pairs — 'actor/actress', 'king/queen'. Arabic extends this to ALL nouns."
- Introduce: [masculine](/resources/glossary#mudhakkar) (mudhakkar / مُذَكَّر) and [feminine](/resources/glossary#muannath) (muʾannath / مُؤَنَّث)

- **Taa Marbuta (ة):**
- Plain English: "The most reliable gender clue is the letter ة (called taa marbuta) at the end of a word. If a word ends in ة, it's almost always feminine."
- Introduce: [taa marbuta](/resources/glossary#taa-marbuta) (tāʾ marbūṭah / تَاء مَرْبُوطَة)
- Show examples: مَدْرَسَة (school, feminine) vs كِتَاب (book, masculine)

- GrammarTable: gender identification clues — taa marbuta ending, natural gender (mother/father), common exceptions
- Note exceptions: Some words are feminine without taa marbuta (أُمّ mother, أَرْض earth, شَمْس sun, نَار fire)
- Note: Some words with taa marbuta refer to males (خَلِيفَة caliph) — but the WORD is still grammatically feminine

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah An-Nasr
- Show masculine nouns: نَصْر (help/victory), فَتْح (conquest)
- Show feminine nouns: words with taa marbuta and natural feminine nouns
- Word-by-word analysis highlighting gender markers
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Every Arabic noun is either masculine (mudhakkar) or feminine (muʾannath). The easiest test: if it ends in ة (taa marbuta), it's feminine. Most other nouns are masculine unless they refer to naturally female beings."
- Callout type="warning": "Don't assume English logic — 'sun' (شَمْس) is feminine in Arabic while 'moon' (قَمَر) is masculine. Learn each word's gender as you go."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Is this word masculine or feminine? What clue tells you?"
  2. Pattern recognition: "Sort these 6 Quranic words into masculine and feminine columns"
  3. Analysis: "Why is أُمّ (mother) feminine even though it doesn't end in ة?"
  4. Application: "Identify the gender of every noun in this short Quranic verse"

title: "Singular, Dual & Plural"
level: 1
order: 9
description: "Distinguish between singular, dual, and plural forms of nouns, recognize dual endings, and understand number agreement basics."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq showing number-related vocabulary
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Distinguish between singular, dual, and plural forms of nouns
  2. Recognize dual endings (-ān, -ayn) and sound plural patterns
  3. Understand number agreement basics
- Connection: "In L1.08 you learned that nouns have gender. Now let's learn about number — but Arabic has a SURPRISE: it doesn't just have singular and plural. It has a special form for exactly TWO things."

**Section 2 — Understanding Number in Arabic:**
- Plain English first: "English has singular (one book) and plural (books). Arabic adds a THIRD category: dual (exactly two books). This is unique to Arabic and a few other languages."
- English analogy: "Imagine if English had: 'book' (1), 'booktwo' (exactly 2), and 'books' (3+). That's basically what Arabic does — with suffixes instead of separate words."
- Introduce: [singular](/resources/glossary#mufrad) (mufrad / مُفْرَد), [dual](/resources/glossary#muthanna) (muthannā / مُثَنَّى), [plural](/resources/glossary#jam) (jamʿ / جَمْع)

- **Dual form:**
- Add suffix -ānِ (-āni) or -يْنِ (-ayni) to singular
- GrammarTable showing: singular → dual transformation for masculine and feminine nouns
- Example: كِتَابٌ → كِتَابَانِ (one book → two books)

- **Plural forms (introduction only — details in L2):**
- Sound masculine plural: add -ونَ (-ūna) or -ِينَ (-īna)
- Sound feminine plural: change ة to -اتٌ (-āt)
- Broken plural: internal pattern change (briefly mention — full coverage in Level 2-3)
- GrammarTable comparing singular → dual → plural for 3-4 common nouns

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Falaq and other short surahs
- Show singular, dual, and plural forms in Quranic context
- Highlight the suffixes that indicate number
- Word-by-word breakdown
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic nouns have three number forms: singular (one), dual (exactly two, marked by -āni/-ayni), and plural (three or more). The dual is unique to Arabic and is formed by adding a suffix to the singular."
- Callout type="warning": "Don't confuse dual endings with regular word endings. The -āni/-ayni suffix is the KEY marker for 'exactly two'."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Is this word singular, dual, or plural? What suffix tells you?"
  2. Transformation: "Convert this singular noun to its dual form"
  3. Recognition: "Find the dual noun in this Quranic verse"
  4. Analysis: "How many of each item is being described in this phrase? (singular, dual, or plural)"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**

- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic (Level 1)
- Use simplified ALA-LC transliteration per STYLE_GUIDE.md
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]

- L1.08 introduces gender with taa marbuta as primary identifier
- L1.09 introduces the unique dual form alongside singular/plural
- GrammarTables show clear singular → dual → plural transformations
- Cross-references: L1.08 -> L1.06, L1.09 -> L1.08 are valid
