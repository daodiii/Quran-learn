<objective>
Create the first 3 Level 1 Foundation lessons covering the Arabic reading fundamentals chain: alphabet recognition (L1.01), short vowels (L1.02), and long vowels with diphthongs (L1.03). Also remove the existing placeholder file.

Purpose: These 3 lessons form the foundational reading chain — learners cannot progress to any other lessons without first mastering letter recognition and vowel pronunciation. They must be created first as all subsequent lessons depend on this reading ability.

Output: 3 complete MDX lesson files following the mandatory 5-part structure with full transliteration, Quranic verse examples, and 3-4 practice exercises each.

title: "Arabic Alphabet & Letter Forms"
level: 1
order: 1
description: "Learn to recognize all 28 Arabic letters in their isolated, initial, medial, and final forms."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox (all from @components/mdx/)

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: Open with a Quranic verse from Al-Fatiha showing how Arabic letters connect beautifully
- Learning Objectives (3 bullets per CURRICULUM_MAP.md):
  1. Recognize all 28 Arabic letters in isolated, initial, medial, and final forms
  2. Understand the concept of connecting letters in cursive Arabic script
  3. Distinguish between similar-looking letters (ba/ta/tha, jim/ha/kha)
- Connection: "This is your starting point — mastering the alphabet unlocks every future lesson"

**Section 2 — Understanding the Arabic Alphabet:**
- Plain English first: "Arabic has 28 letters, like English has 26. But unlike English printed letters, Arabic letters CHANGE SHAPE depending on where they appear in a word — much like how English cursive connects differently at the start, middle, and end of a word."
- English analogy: Compare to English cursive handwriting where letters flow together
- Introduce Arabic terminology LAST: [alphabet](/resources/glossary#huruf-al-hija) (ḥurūf al-hijāʾ / حُرُوفُ ٱلْهِجَاء)
- Use a GrammarTable to show all 28 letters in their 4 forms (isolated, initial, medial, final)
- Group similar letters together (ب ت ث, ج ح خ, etc.) to highlight distinguishing dots
- Note which letters are non-connecting (و ز ر ذ د ا) — they only have 2 forms

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample components from Surah Al-Fatiha
- Show letter forms in context — highlight specific letters showing different positions
- Word-by-word breakdown of at least one verse showing letter connections
- Progress from single-word examples to full phrases
- ALL Arabic text must have complete tashkeel (fatha/kasra/damma/sukun/shadda on every letter)
- ALL examples must include transliteration (Level 1 requirement)

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Arabic letters have up to 4 forms depending on position. Most letters connect on both sides. Six letters (alif, dal, dhal, ra, zayn, waw) only connect to the letter before them."
- Callout type="warning": Common mistake — confusing similar letter groups (ب/ت/ث differ only by dots)

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox components with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Which form of the letter ba (ب) is used in this word?" (show a Quranic word)
  2. Matching: "Match each letter to its position (initial, medial, final)"
  3. Distinction: "Which letters in this phrase are non-connecting?"
  4. Application: "Identify all forms of the letter mim (م) in this verse from Al-Fatiha"
- Each answer includes detailed explanation

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Next: [Short Vowels (Harakat)](/learn/level-1/short-vowels) — "Now that you know the letters, learn how vowels bring them to life"

**Create L1.02: Short Vowels (Harakat)**

Frontmatter: title "Short Vowels (Harakat)", level 1, order 2, description about identifying and pronouncing the three short vowels.

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas showing how vowels completely change pronunciation
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Identify and pronounce the three short vowels: fatha, kasra, damma
  2. Understand how vowels affect consonant pronunciation
  3. Read simple voweled words from the Quran
- Connection: "In L1.01 you learned the 28 consonant letters. Now let's add the sounds that bring them to life."

**Section 2 — Understanding Short Vowels:**
- Plain English first: "Arabic consonants without vowels are like English consonants without vowels — 'BK' could be 'book', 'bike', or 'bake'. Arabic uses small marks ABOVE or BELOW letters to show which vowel sound to use."
- English analogy: "Think of vowel marks as pronunciation instructions written in the margins — they tell you HOW to say each letter"
- Introduce Arabic terminology LAST: Use bilingual first-mention format for [short vowels](/resources/glossary#harakat) (ḥarakāt / حَرَكَات), [fatha](/resources/glossary#fatha) (fatḥah / فَتْحَة), [kasra](/resources/glossary#kasra) (kasrah / كَسْرَة), [damma](/resources/glossary#damma) (ḍammah / ضَمَّة)
- GrammarTable showing each vowel: symbol, name, pronunciation, English equivalent sound

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Ikhlas (simple, repetitive vowel patterns)
- Show same consonant with different vowels producing different words
- Word-by-word breakdown highlighting vowel marks
- All Arabic fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Every Arabic consonant in the Quran carries a vowel mark (or sukun for no vowel). Fatha (ـَ) = 'a', Kasra (ـِ) = 'i', Damma (ـُ) = 'u'."
- Callout type="warning": "The most common beginner mistake is ignoring vowel marks and guessing pronunciation"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox: identification of vowels in words, pronunciation matching, reading simple voweled Quranic words

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Arabic Alphabet & Letter Forms](/learn/level-1/alphabet-letter-forms)
- Next: [Long Vowels & Diphthongs](/learn/level-1/long-vowels-diphthongs) and [Sukun, Shadda & Tanween](/learn/level-1/sukun-shadda-tanween)

**Create L1.03: Long Vowels & Diphthongs**

Frontmatter: title "Long Vowels & Diphthongs", level 1, order 3, description about distinguishing short and long vowels and pronouncing diphthongs.

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar showing prominent long vowel examples
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Distinguish between short and long vowels (alif, waw, ya as vowel carriers)
  2. Pronounce diphthongs (ay, aw)
  3. Read Quranic words containing long vowels correctly
- Connection: "In L1.02 you learned the short 'a', 'i', 'u' sounds. Now let's stretch them out."

**Section 2 — Understanding Long Vowels & Diphthongs:**
- Plain English first: "English has short vowels (bit, but, bat) and long vowels (beat, boot, bait). Arabic works similarly — short vowels have long versions that last about twice as long."
- English analogy: "Short 'a' in 'hat' vs long 'a' in 'father' — Arabic marks the difference explicitly"
- GrammarTable: short vowel → long vowel pairing (fatha+alif = ā, kasra+ya = ī, damma+waw = ū)
- Introduce diphthongs: fatha+waw = aw, fatha+ya = ay
- Arabic terminology LAST with first-mention bilingual format

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Kawthar
- Show words with short vs long vowel minimal pairs where possible
- Highlight diphthong examples
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "A long vowel is a short vowel + a carrier letter: fatha + alif = ā, kasra + ya = ī, damma + waw = ū. Hold the sound twice as long."
- Callout type="warning": "Don't confuse waw/ya as consonants vs. vowel carriers — context determines their role"

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox: short vs long vowel identification, diphthong recognition, reading practice

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Short Vowels (Harakat)](/learn/level-1/short-vowels)
- Next: [Reading Practice with Bismillah](/learn/level-1/reading-bismillah) (after completing L1.04)

**Critical requirements for BOTH lessons:**
- Every Arabic letter must have tashkeel (validation ≥70% ratio)
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic text (Level 1 requirement)
- Use simplified ALA-LC transliteration per STYLE_GUIDE.md Section 2
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format for all grammar terms per TERMINOLOGY.md
