<objective>
Create 2 Level 1 Foundation lessons introducing Arabic grammar concepts: L1.06 covering the three fundamental word types (ism, fi'l, harf), and L1.07 covering the definite article (al-) with sun/moon letter pronunciation rules.

Purpose: L1.06 is the gateway to grammar — it introduces the most fundamental categorization in Arabic (every word is a noun, verb, or particle). L1.07 builds on this by teaching the definite article, which is essential for recognizing definite nouns in every subsequent lesson. Together they transition learners from reading to understanding.

Output: 2 complete MDX lesson files with full transliteration, Quranic examples from Al-Asr (L1.06) and Al-Fatiha (L1.07), and 3-4 exercises each.

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr showing all three word types in one compact surah
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Distinguish between the three fundamental word categories in Arabic
  2. Understand the basic function of each category (noun, verb, particle)
  3. Identify word types in simple Quranic phrases
- Connection: "You can now READ Arabic (L1.01-L1.05). Let's start UNDERSTANDING it. The first step is learning that every Arabic word falls into exactly one of three categories."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Three Word Types:**
- Plain English first: "In English, we have parts of speech — nouns (person, place, thing), verbs (action words), and everything else (prepositions, conjunctions, etc.). Arabic simplifies this into just THREE categories, and EVERY word fits one of them."
- English analogy: "Think of it like sorting mail into three boxes: 'Things' (nouns), 'Actions' (verbs), and 'Connectors' (particles). Every word goes in exactly one box."

- **Ism (Noun)** — English first: "A word that names something — a person, place, thing, idea, time, or quality. Unlike English nouns, Arabic nouns also include adjectives and adverbs."
- Introduce: [noun](/resources/glossary#ism) (ism / اِسْم)
- Key characteristic: Takes tanween (from L1.04!) — a noun test

- **Fi'l (Verb)** — English first: "A word that describes an action tied to a specific time — past, present, or future."
- Introduce: [verb](/resources/glossary#fil) (fiʿl / فِعْل)
- Key characteristic: Connected to time — past, present, or command

- **Harf (Particle)** — English first: "A word that has meaning ONLY when used with other words — like 'in', 'on', 'but', 'and'. They're the glue that holds sentences together."
- Introduce: [particle](/resources/glossary#harf) (ḥarf / حَرْف)
- Key characteristic: Has no independent meaning

- GrammarTable comparing all three with examples, English equivalents, and identifying characteristics

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Asr (all three word types in compact structure)
- Walk through Surah Al-Asr verse by verse identifying word types
- Color-code or highlight different word types
- Show word-by-word breakdown: "وَ (particle: and) + ٱلْعَصْرِ (noun: time/era)"
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Every Arabic word is either an ism (noun — names things), fiʿl (verb — shows action in time), or ḥarf (particle — connects words). If it takes tanween or al-, it's an ism. If it shows tense, it's a fiʿl. Everything else is a ḥarf."
- Callout type="warning": "Arabic 'ism' is BROADER than English 'noun' — it includes adjectives and adverbs too. Don't limit your thinking to just people, places, and things."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Classify each word in this phrase: وَٱلْعَصْرِ (ism, fi'l, or harf?)"
  2. Recognition: "Find all the nouns (ism) in this verse from Al-Asr"
  3. Analysis: "Why is this word an ism and not a fi'l? What clue tells you?"
  4. Application: "Label every word in this short Quranic phrase by type"

title: "The Definite Article (Al-)"
level: 1
order: 7
description: "Recognize the definite article and its pronunciation rules including sun and moon letters."
draft: false
---
```

**Imports:** ArabicExample, GrammarTable, Callout, ExerciseBox

**Section 1 — Introduction:**
- Hook: ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (multiple ال examples: ٱلْحَمْدُ, ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ, ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ, ٱلرَّحِيمِ)
- Objectives per CURRICULUM_MAP.md:
  1. Recognize the definite article and its pronunciation rules (sun/moon letters)
  2. Understand the difference between definite and indefinite nouns
  3. Identify definite nouns in Quranic verses
- Connection: "In L1.06 you learned that nouns (ism) can take tanween. But what if you want to say THE book instead of A book? Arabic has a simple prefix for this."

**Section 2 — Understanding the Definite Article:**
- Plain English first: "English uses 'the' to make nouns specific — 'a book' vs 'THE book'. Arabic does the same thing by adding أَلْ (al-) to the beginning of the noun."
- English analogy: "'A cat' = any cat. 'THE cat' = a specific cat. Arabic: كِتَابٌ (a book) vs ٱلْكِتَابُ (THE book)"
- Introduce: [definite article](/resources/glossary#al) (al- / أَلْ)
- Definite vs indefinite: Introduce [definite](/resources/glossary#marifah) (maʿrifah / مَعْرِفَة) and [indefinite](/resources/glossary#nakirah) (nakirah / نَكِرَة)
- Key insight: "When al- is added, tanween DISAPPEARS — a noun can't be 'a/an' and 'the' at the same time"

- **Sun and Moon Letters:**
- Plain English: "The 'l' in al- is sometimes pronounced and sometimes 'swallowed' by the next letter. This depends on whether the next letter is a 'sun letter' or 'moon letter'."
- GrammarTable listing sun letters (14) and moon letters (14)
- Sun letter rule: lam assimilates into the following letter (al-shams → ash-shams in speech, but ALWAYS written al-)
- Moon letter rule: lam is pronounced normally (al-qamar remains al-qamar)
- Introduce: [sun letters](/resources/glossary#huruf-shamsiyyah) (ḥurūf shamsiyyah / حُرُوف شَمْسِيَّة) and [moon letters](/resources/glossary#huruf-qamariyyah) (ḥurūf qamariyyah / حُرُوف قَمَرِيَّة)

**Section 3 — Examples from the Quran:**
- 3-5 ArabicExample from Surah Al-Fatiha (rich with definite articles)
- Show sun letter assimilation: ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ (ar-raḥmān — ra is sun letter)
- Show moon letter preservation: ٱلْعَٰلَمِينَ (al-ʿālamīn — ayn is moon letter)
- Show definite vs indefinite pairs from Quranic text
- Word-by-word breakdowns highlighting al- prefix behavior
- All fully vocalized with transliteration

**Section 4 — The Rule:**
- Callout type="rule": "Adding أَلْ (al-) makes a noun definite (specific). With sun letters, the lam assimilates — you pronounce the next letter doubled. With moon letters, the lam stays. Tanween and al- never appear together."
- Callout type="warning": "In writing, al- is ALWAYS spelled the same (أَلْ) regardless of sun/moon. The assimilation is only in pronunciation. In transliteration, we ALWAYS write 'al-' per our style guide."

**Section 5 — Practice:**
- 3-4 ExerciseBox with progressive difficulty:
  1. Identification: "Which of these words has the definite article? كِتَابٌ or ٱلْكِتَابُ?"
  2. Classification: "Is the letter after al- in this word a sun letter or moon letter?"
  3. Pronunciation: "How would you pronounce ٱلشَّمْسِ? Does the lam sound or assimilate?"
  4. Application: "Find all the definite nouns in this verse from Al-Fatiha and identify which use sun vs moon letter rules"

**Section 6 — Related Lessons:**
- Previous: [Three Word Types](/learn/level-1/three-word-types)
- Prepares for: Level 2 lessons on noun modification and sentence structure

**Critical requirements:**
- ALL Arabic must have complete tashkeel (≥70% validation ratio)
- Full transliteration for ALL Arabic (Level 1)
- Use simplified ALA-LC transliteration — ALWAYS write "al-" even before sun letters
- Verse references format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- First-mention bilingual format per TERMINOLOGY.md
