<objective>
Create structured expert review checklists for Arabic linguist and Muslim educator validation, plus cultural sensitivity guidelines documenting Quranic text handling standards.

Purpose: Success criteria #2 (expert linguist validation) and #3 (cultural sensitivity review) require formal review workflows that don't exist yet. Automated validation is necessary but insufficient for cultural and linguistic correctness.
Output: expert-review-checklist.md, cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md

Create two markdown documents that establish the formal expert review process for the 73-lesson Quranic Arabic Grammar curriculum.

**File 1: expert-review-checklist.md**

Structure the checklist in three parts:

**Part 1: Arabic Linguistic Accuracy (Arabic Linguist)**
Include checkbox items for:
- Grammar & Morphology: exercise answer keys grammatical correctness, verb conjugation table accuracy against classical references, case ending explanations alignment with traditional nahw, morphological patterns (awzan) correctly applied, i'rab analysis accuracy
- Diacritics & Pronunciation: complete/accurate tashkeel on all Arabic text, Quranic verse diacritics match Uthmanic Mushaf, transliteration matches phonetic reality (simplified ALA-LC per STYLE_GUIDE.md), no ambiguous vocalization that changes word meaning
- Terminology: Arabic terms match classical terminology, transliterations consistent with TERMINOLOGY.md standard, English translations capture precise grammatical meanings, no overgeneralization
- Validation notes section for linguist findings
- Sign-off block with name, date, and approval status

**Part 2: Cultural & Religious Sensitivity (Muslim Educator)**
Include checkbox items for:
- Quranic Text Handling: verses accurately transcribed (no omissions/changes), verse references correctly formatted [Surah Name Chapter:Verse], translations respectful and align with accepted tafsir traditions, no inappropriate commentary, prophetic names with appropriate salutations where expected
- Cultural Context: examples culturally appropriate for Muslim learners, no content contradicting Islamic teachings, respect for diverse scholarly opinions, sensitive topics handled appropriately
- Pedagogical Integrity: progression appropriate for Quranic Arabic goals, examples prioritize Quranic understanding, no confusion between religious vs linguistic concepts, learning objectives align with traditional Quran study methods
- Accessibility: language accessible to non-native English speakers, inclusive of diverse Muslim communities, no assumptions about prior Islamic education, respectful of different practice levels
- Validation notes section for educator findings
- Sign-off block with name, date, and approval status

**Part 3: Cross-Review Discussion**
- Template for issues requiring both expert consensus
- Fields: issue description, linguist perspective, educator perspective, resolution
- Final joint approval block

Include header with:
- Curriculum scope: 73 lessons across 5 levels, 6 reference resources
- Review documents: TERMINOLOGY.md, STYLE_GUIDE.md, CURRICULUM_MAP.md references
- Review process: automated validation passes first, then expert review
- Timeline expectations and sign-off requirements

**File 2: cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md**

Create project-specific cultural sensitivity standards covering:

1. **Quranic Text Handling Standards**
   - Verse accuracy: must match Uthmanic text exactly, never paraphrase
   - Diacritics: full tashkeel required for all Quranic text
   - Verse reference format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse] (per STYLE_GUIDE.md)
   - Translation approach: aim for grammatical meaning, not theological interpretation
   - Context: provide surah context when verse selection matters

2. **Prophetic References**
   - Salutations: use appropriate peace formula when prophets mentioned by name (e.g., "peace be upon him")
   - Respectful language: objective, reverential tone
   - Avoid hagiographic excess: focus on linguistic analysis, not religious biography

3. **Scholarly Diversity**
   - When grammar rules have multiple valid scholarly opinions, note this
   - Don't privilege one madhab/school over others
   - Present classical consensus where it exists
   - Mark scholarly debates explicitly (e.g., "scholars differ on...")

4. **Theological Boundaries**
   - Grammar lessons should explain linguistic structures, not interpret theology
   - When theological content is unavoidable (e.g., discussing divine names), present with factual linguistic framing
   - Avoid sectarian positions

5. **Inclusive Language**
   - Assume diverse Muslim audience (converts, heritage speakers, non-Muslims studying Arabic)
   - Don't assume prior Islamic education
   - Explain Islamic concepts briefly when used in examples (e.g., "salah (the daily prayer)")
   - Use accessible English vocabulary

6. **Exercise and Example Selection**
   - Prioritize universally accepted Quranic passages
   - Avoid contentious verses (those commonly misquoted or politically sensitive)
   - Balance masculine and feminine grammatical examples
   - Include examples from various surahs (not just short popular ones)

Keep both documents practical and actionable. Total combined length: 200-300 lines.

Verify both files exist and contain the required sections:
```bash
ls -la .planning/phases/17-quality-assurance-validation/expert-review-checklist.md
ls -la .planning/phases/17-quality-assurance-validation/cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md
grep -c "\- \[ \]" .planning/phases/17-quality-assurance-validation/expert-review-checklist.md
grep "Sign-off" .planning/phases/17-quality-assurance-validation/expert-review-checklist.md
grep "Quranic Text" .planning/phases/17-quality-assurance-validation/cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md
```
Checklist should have 25+ checkbox items. Both files should exist with non-zero content.
  </verify>
  <done>
- expert-review-checklist.md exists with Part 1 (Linguist), Part 2 (Educator), Part 3 (Cross-Review)
- Each part has specific checkbox items and sign-off blocks
- cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md exists with 6 sections covering Quranic text, prophetic references, scholarly diversity, theology boundaries, inclusive language, and example selection
- Both documents reference project standards (TERMINOLOGY.md, STYLE_GUIDE.md, CURRICULUM_MAP.md)
  </done>

1. expert-review-checklist.md has three parts with checkbox items and sign-off blocks
2. cultural-sensitivity-guidelines.md has six sections with actionable guidelines
3. Both documents reference project-specific standards
4. Checklist items are specific and verifiable (not vague like "content is good")

<success_criteria>
- Expert review process is formally documented with clear acceptance criteria
- Cultural sensitivity guidelines are specific to Quranic Arabic educational content
- Both documents are ready for expert use without additional interpretation
- Sign-off blocks provide audit trail for production readiness decision
