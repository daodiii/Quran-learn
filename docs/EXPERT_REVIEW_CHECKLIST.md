### I'rab (Grammatical Parsing)
- [ ] I'rab analysis examples are grammatically correct in function assignment
- [ ] Case marker identification (damma, fatha, kasra, tanween) is accurate
- [ ] Three-part i'rab format (Function + Case marker + Reason) is consistently applied in Level 2+
- [ ] Morphological i'rab extensions (Root + Pattern + Form) are accurate in Level 3+
- [ ] No incorrect grammatical function labels (e.g., mislabeling khabar as mubtada)

### Verb Conjugation
- [ ] Past tense conjugation paradigms are accurate across all 14 persons
- [ ] Present tense conjugation paradigms are accurate (prefix + suffix system)
- [ ] Imperative forms are correctly derived (prefix removal, hamza addition rules)
- [ ] Verb form patterns (I through X) match standard morphological templates
- [ ] Irregular verb conjugations are correctly documented (hollow, defective, assimilated, hamzated)
- [ ] Mood markers (indicative, subjunctive, jussive) are correctly identified

### Root and Pattern System
- [ ] Root extraction examples correctly identify three-letter (and four-letter) roots
- [ ] Pattern identification (wazan) uses correct template forms
- [ ] Derived noun formations (active participle, passive participle, masdar) follow standard rules
- [ ] Place/time noun patterns (maf'al, maf'il) are correctly applied based on verb vowel class

### Case System
- [ ] Nominative case (raf') usage rules are correctly explained
- [ ] Accusative case (nasb) usage rules are correctly explained
- [ ] Genitive case (jarr) usage rules are correctly explained
- [ ] Special accusative functions (hal, tamyiz, maf'ul mutlaq, maf'ul li-ajlih, maf'ul ma'ah) are accurately described
- [ ] Exception constructions (istithna') case rules are accurate

### Diacritical Marks (Tashkeel)
- [ ] All Arabic text has correctly placed diacritical marks
- [ ] Fatha, kasra, damma are on the correct letters
- [ ] Shadda (consonant doubling) is correctly placed
- [ ] Sukun marks are correctly placed
- [ ] Tanween (nunation) forms are accurate

## Section 2: Quranic Verse Accuracy

### Verse Transcription
- [ ] All Quranic verses are transcribed accurately from an authoritative mushaf
- [ ] Uthmani script conventions are maintained
- [ ] Special Quranic orthographic features are preserved (alif al-wiqayah, dagger alif)
- [ ] No typographical errors in any Quranic text

### Verse References
- [ ] All verse references follow the format: [Surah Name Chapter:Verse]
- [ ] Surah names are correctly spelled
- [ ] Ayah numbers are correct (verified against standard Uthmani numbering)
- [ ] No verse is attributed to the wrong surah

### Verse Translations
- [ ] Translations are faithful to classical tafsir interpretations
- [ ] Translations prioritize grammatical clarity over literary elegance (pedagogical purpose)
- [ ] No mistranslations that could alter the meaning of Quranic text
- [ ] Where multiple valid translations exist, the most grammatically illustrative one is chosen

---

## Section 3: Exercise Accuracy

For EACH lesson, the reviewer should check using the [Exercise Review Template](./EXERCISE_REVIEW_TEMPLATE.md):

- [ ] Exercise questions are grammatically sound
- [ ] All answer keys are correct (verified independently)
- [ ] Exercise difficulty matches the lesson's stated level
- [ ] Exercises test the lesson's stated learning objectives
- [ ] Each lesson has a minimum of 3-4 exercises
- [ ] No exercise requires knowledge that has not been taught yet

---

## Section 4: Pedagogical Integrity

### Learning Progression
- [ ] Concepts progress logically from simple to complex across all 5 levels
- [ ] Level 1 establishes all necessary reading skills before grammar begins
- [ ] Level 2 builds case system mastery on Level 1 recognition
- [ ] Level 3 introduces morphology with appropriate prerequisite knowledge
- [ ] Level 4 applies grammar to complex constructions
- [ ] Level 5 synthesizes all prior levels in verse analysis

### Prerequisite Accuracy
- [ ] No concept is used before it has been formally taught
- [ ] Prerequisite chains in CURRICULUM_MAP.md are accurate and sufficient
- [ ] Forward references are clearly marked as previews
- [ ] Each lesson explicitly connects back to its prerequisite lessons

### Explanatory Quality
- [ ] Explanations are accurate without oversimplification that creates misconceptions
- [ ] English analogies are appropriate and do not mislead about Arabic structure
- [ ] Technical terms are introduced with bilingual format on first mention
- [ ] One concept per lesson is maintained (no concept overload)
- [ ] Examples precede rules (show patterns before stating abstract grammar)
