# Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines: Quranic Arabic Grammar Curriculum

**Purpose:** These guidelines ensure that all content in the Quranic Arabic grammar curriculum treats the Quran, Islamic concepts, and diverse Muslim communities with appropriate reverence, accuracy, and inclusivity.

---

## 1. Quranic Text Treatment

### Reverent Presentation
- Always refer to the Quran as "the Quran" or "the Noble Quran" in English
- Use "says" or "states" when attributing Quranic text, not casual language
- Never abbreviate or truncate Quranic verses mid-word
- When showing partial verses, use ellipsis (...) to indicate continuation
- Maintain mushaf orthography (Uthmani script) for all Quranic text

### Textual Integrity
- All Quranic text must be transcribed from an authoritative mushaf source
- Full diacritical marks (tashkeel) must be present on all Quranic text
- Uthmani script conventions must be preserved (dagger alif, alif al-wiqayah, etc.)
- No creative modifications to Quranic text for pedagogical convenience
- Verse boundaries must be respected — do not merge or split verses

### Translation Standards
- Translations serve a grammatical pedagogical purpose, not theological interpretation
- Prioritize grammatically illustrative translations over literary translations
- When multiple valid translations exist, choose the most widely accepted
- Always include the original Arabic alongside any translation
- Never present translation as a substitute for the original Arabic

---

## 2. Theological Neutrality

### Grammar-Focused Approach
- The curriculum teaches Arabic grammar, not theology or tafsir
- Present grammar without sectarian interpretation
- Focus on linguistic analysis, not theological implications
- When a grammatical point has theological significance, note it neutrally

### Multiple Valid Analyses
- When multiple valid grammatical analyses exist for a verse, acknowledge alternatives
- Present the most widely accepted analysis as primary, noting others exist
- Use phrases like "scholars have noted..." or "another valid analysis is..."
- Never present one scholarly opinion as the only valid interpretation

### Neutral Terminology
- Use standard Sunni-Shia-neutral terminology throughout
- Reference well-accepted classical sources (Sibawayh, Ibn Hisham, Az-Zamakhshari, Ibn Aqeel)
- Avoid controversial tafsir positions — focus on grammar, not theology
- When citing scholarly opinions, cite the grammatical insight, not the theological position

---

## 3. Respectful Language

### Honorifics
- Prophet Muhammad: include appropriate honorific on first mention in each lesson
- Other prophets: "peace be upon him" or equivalent on first mention
- Allah: use respectful language when mentioning the divine name in prose
- Companions and scholars: use appropriate titles (e.g., "the scholar Ibn Hisham")

### Tone and Register
- Maintain academic yet accessible tone when discussing sacred text
- Never use casual, flippant, or humorous tone when discussing Quranic content
- Grammar analysis should be scholarly and respectful
- Exercise questions should treat verses with the same reverence as lesson content

### Pedagogical Framing
- Frame grammatical analysis as a tool for deeper understanding of the Quran
- Emphasize that understanding grammar enhances appreciation of Quranic eloquence
- Present balagha (rhetoric) analysis with awe and respect for Quranic literary excellence
- Never imply that grammatical analysis "explains away" Quranic meaning

---

## 4. Inclusive Education

### Welcoming to All Backgrounds
- Content should be accessible to all Muslim traditions (Sunni, Shia, Ibadi, etc.)
- Non-Muslim Arabic learners should also feel welcomed and respected
- No assumptions about the learner's sect, school of thought, or level of practice
- Grammar focus means theological debates are explicitly out of scope

### Sensitivity to Learning Levels
- Beginners may have minimal Arabic or Islamic background — never assume prior knowledge
- Avoid assuming familiarity with specific prayers, du'as, or Islamic practices
- When using familiar verses (Al-Fatiha, Ayat al-Kursi), briefly note their significance
- Provide context for Quranic passages when needed for grammatical understanding

### Language Choices
- Use "the Quran" (not "the Koran" or other transliterations)
- Use standard Islamic terminology with bilingual format (per TERMINOLOGY.md)
- Avoid orientalist or outdated terminology
- Respect Arabic linguistic conventions (right-to-left, proper diacritization)

---

## 5. Content Red Lines

The following MUST NOT appear in any lesson or resource:

### Absolutely Prohibited
- Grammatical examples that could be construed as disrespectful to the Quran
- Cherry-picked verses for controversial or political readings
- Mocking or dismissive tone toward any grammatical opinion or scholarly tradition
- Political commentary using Quranic examples
- Encouragement of literal-only translation without grammatical context
- Sectarian advocacy or criticism of any Islamic school of thought
- Decontextualized verse fragments that alter apparent meaning

### Avoid
- Comparing Quranic Arabic unfavorably to any other language or text
- Suggesting that grammatical irregularities indicate textual problems
- Using controversial theological verses as routine grammar examples
- Implying that one's ability to understand Arabic grammar determines faith
- Making definitive claims about authorial intent beyond grammatical analysis

## Review Process

When reviewing content for cultural sensitivity:

1. **Read each lesson** with attention to tone and presentation of sacred text
2. **Check verse usage** — are verses presented in appropriate context?
3. **Review translations** — are they neutral and grammatically focused?
4. **Assess inclusivity** — would learners from diverse backgrounds feel welcomed?
5. **Flag any concerns** using the Expert Review Checklist

*These guidelines should be reviewed by a diverse panel of Muslim educators before publication.*
