## Notes

**Pedagogical Progression:**
- Levels 1-2 establish reading and basic grammar fundamentals
- Level 3 introduces morphology and verb system complexity
- Level 4 covers advanced syntax and irregular patterns
- Level 5 applies all knowledge to real Quranic analysis

**Transliteration Strategy:**
- Level 1: Full transliteration (Latin alphabet alongside Arabic)
- Level 2: Balanced (transliteration for new concepts, Arabic emphasized)
- Level 3: Partial (Arabic primary, transliteration for difficult terms)
- Level 4-5: Minimal (Arabic text with diacritics, limited transliteration)

**Quranic Text Selection:**
- Earlier lessons use shorter, simpler surahs (Juz 'Amma focus)
- Later lessons incorporate longer surahs and narrative passages
- All verses selected for pedagogical clarity, not obscurity
